Masque</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M008754/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Markets for the Masque is a follow-on project designed to consolidate the success of practice-based research started in 2005, AHRC-funded for its first three years and supported by the University of Southampton since then. It takes the outcome of the research in two new directions, one championing the performance of masque music to a classical music circuit with the group Theatre of the Ayre, and the other exploring the connections with plucked improvisation across genre boundaries, in collaboration with members of the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain. Both approaches bring a quasi-theatrical style of presentation and correspondingly adventurous improvisation to mid seventeenth century English vocal music, and beyond it to uncover similar structures in other kinds of music with plucked accompaniment.

The practice-based research encouraged florid ornamentation of vocal lines, opening the way both to enjoyment and to appreciation of swathes of sketchily notated material produced by leading English composer-performers of the early baroque period. This project will take this to new audiences worldwide through the recording of a CD for Linn Records, and develop relationships with festivals and venues across the UK (Salisbury, Buxton, Swaledale, St David's, The Stables Wavendon). 

A new rationale has emerged for musical collaboration between players of early plucked instruments like the lute and baroque guitar and not-so-early cognates like the ukulele. Collective improvisation across genre boundaries encourages listeners to cross them too. I first encountered the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain on CD and via YouTube. Their bravura musicianship and unshakable sense of ensemble seemed to me to set a standard to which Theatre of the Ayre's lute section should aspire. Subsequent personal contact and a series of trial workshops led to Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes, a hybrid group whose eclectic programmes mix seventeenth and twentieth century music, switching seamlessly and repeatedly between old and relatively new. All the group's singers self-accompany on their plucked instrument of choice. Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes draws inspiration from the world of the seventeenth century English masque without attempting to recreate it. Performances range from serious to riotously comic in the same way (masque-antimasque), and through sheer variety they help promoters cast audience development nets wider than ever. 

The next phase of development both for Theatre of the Ayre and for Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes will be to increase both groups' visibility on the promotional circuit and build market value for their respective repertoires.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>AHRC support will unlock partnership funding as follows:

Salisbury Festival engagement fee &amp;pound;4,125
St David's* &amp;pound;6,000
The Stables &amp;pound;3,000
Swaledale &amp;pound;3,000
Buxton &amp;pound;3,000

* St David's Cathedral can accommodate a large audience, enabling St David's Festival to pay a higher fee than other promoters. 

The Salisbury Festival will provide promotional services valued at &amp;pound;4,000 and Linn will cover the &amp;pound;9,000 cost of CD production. 

In Salisbury Theatre of the Ayre will reach a live audience totalling around 300. Festival publicity is widely distributed: at least 100,000 people will be made aware that The Masque of Moments is happening and will learn about the music on offer.

Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes will reach a live audience totalling around 1,500 (St David's 600; The Stables 300; Swaledale 300; Buxton 300). Education sessions in Swaledale will involve approximately 60 schoolchildren.

Theatre of the Ayre's Linn CD should sell between 1,500 and 2,500 hard copies. Radio exposure is expected. 

The Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes recording will be made available online. Some Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain postings have been watched over 1 million times. Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes has more modest ambitions but should achieve a YouTube audience numbered in tens of thousands.

Research published by UK Music and VisitBritain suggests that domestic music tourists spend &amp;pound;87 per head on average when attending concerts [Wish you were here: Music tourism's contribution to the UK economy, October 2013, p. 43]. This includes the cost of concert tickets. On a conservative estimate Markets for the Masque should trigger &amp;pound;40-50,000 in consumer spending on goods and services other than live music, not counting income generated by Linn through the sale of CDs and downloads.

Thus the immediate economic impact delivered by Markets for the Masque will be in the region of &amp;pound;100,000:
Fees to artists &amp;pound;45,000 
Linn's up-front investment in CD production &amp;pound;9,000
Induced audience expenditure on food, drink, accommodation etc.

Wider cultural impact

Markets for the Masque will normalize programming and approaches to performance currently thought of as experimental. Further successful outings together with the availability of a prestigious Linn CD and a strong YouTube presence for Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes will build promoter confidence, generating work for both groups. Greater public understanding and appreciation of mid seventeenth century English theatre music should result, and a new lute-playing platform outside the instrument's early music heartland will exist. 

Markets for the Masque is ideally timed. The new Sam Wanamaker Theatre at the Globe in London stretching the &amp;quot;Shakespearean&amp;quot; envelope in some very creative ways. I am collaborating with Globe/Wanamaker on a number of projects complementing Markets for the Masque (eg: a Restoration Tempest with music, and Moli&amp;egrave;re's Le Malade Imaginaire in English translation, including music by Charpentier). Strong synergies are apparent: I shall take full advantage of them.

Professional development

Theatre of the Ayre has up to 20 musicians. Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes has 8 playing members plus a sound engineer. Neither group's line-up is completely fixed: different programmes need different vocal/instrumental combinations and promoter preferences need accommodating. I have worked with more than 40 colleagues in both groups since 2005: a substantial body of shared improvisatory expertise has accumulated but is not at this stage as deeply embedded as we wish it to be. With more concert experience we will be able to make performance practice more fluent and communicative, and change the frames of reference between song and theatre music, with a beneficial impact beyond these two groups.

Theatre of the Ayre's CD when released and Lutes &amp;amp; Ukes' YouTube presence once established will transform both groups' marketing operations. New relationships with promoters will build goodwill and allow deeper penetration of promoter networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performance in Ageas Salisbury International Festival of The Masque of Moments (Theatre of the Ayre).</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C6ED832-FD9E-4FB0-8A35-7125E0661CCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sizeable audience showed with the right framing (Salisbury Festival and now also Theatre of the Ayre track record for innovation and performance excellence) relatively little-known repertoire can have popular appeal, while also attracting cognoscenti of the early music scene.

Success measured in audience numbers - one of the stronger performing Festival events - and enthusiastic reception.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Buxton Festival</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Lutes&amp;amp;Ukes St Buxton</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A7F6BA1-1DFF-4AA9-B5FC-0B1544EE0A7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Concert performance of Lutes&amp;amp;Ukes: The Wolves of St Elvis Buxton Festival July 21 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d846c64417b8.78099510-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Providing the umbrella of a long-established Festival with a very diverse range of programmes appealing to different kinds of audience, which was exactly what the research was designed to test (Markets for the Masque: whether a relatively obscure genre could be developed to appeal across genre boundaries).

Their critiques of these methods illuminated both the 17c and modern repertoires. Exchanges of ideas centred around plucked instruments but also widened in scope to include vocal music, ideas for programmes and marketing and audience expectations. they also provided an invaluable social media and fan base to connect with the ukulele community, as well as support in kind in the way of rehearsal facilities and access to the publicity associated with the bigger UOGB. Working methods and research interests of both groups changed in mutually beneficial and continuing ways.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Theatre of the Ayre (my ensemble) is based for this project around 4 lutes. We collaborated with 4 ukuleles from UOGB. Our contribution was providing historical repertoire from the 17c masque tradition as tools for improvisation along 17c lines. Methods of arranging, of counterpoint and of vocal ornamentation were brought from archival and manuscript work as well as the published masque literature, We enabled UOGB to expand their repertoire into classical and early music, and to reach classical audiences and festival infrastructures.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visits</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63CCFEA3-F127-4F8E-8C35-B763F26E36DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshops at Moorlands Primary School for children ages 7-8, interaction with the lute and with singing.

1. The organisation of historical performance can follow models other than conductor-led symphonic-derived ones. Leadership is provided along the lines of theatre: direction happens more in rehearsal, then performers stand independent in concerts,
2. Masque music considered to be relatively unperformable outside academic environments or unfeasible because of huge historical budgets and sketchy source material can be the basis on which programmes can be built. Singers and agents aware of the possibilities this opens up. Connection with a historical sense of place is vital in reaching communities, a principle on which the masque itself - coming out of local, particular, topical issues - is based.
3. Education: through workshops with Lutes&amp;amp;Ukes classical music can be accessible to a wider variety of participants who do not have access to orchestral instruments. Chordal foundations are the building blocs for both classical and popular music when seen from a plucked rather than an &amp;quot;elitist&amp;quot; orchestral perspective</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2F5160CD-8F54-460F-BC73-A439C8DA2BD2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d87b0be52309.10434861</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Rigid genre distinctions in classical music can be unhelpful in reaching audiences. Nothing is so obscure that a connection with local communities and a willingness to move towards existing audience enthusiasm in order to broaden it, cannot be found. 
Historical performance practice is founded in texts, but composer-authorised versions of repertoire are not always the ones that were widely used, not the ones that may be of value in communicating the best of the music to audiences today. Improvisation techniques cut across genre boundaries and are as useful in classical as in popular music, but need generous research and development time to be used with the effectiveness than comes from familiarity with the techniques involved. Conversely, audiences familiar with historical performance can be encouraged to consider performer skills as part of the toolkit for illuminating a broader range of repertoire than currently exists in the composer-dominated market.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>More remains to be done on the work of mid-seventeenth century figures such as William and Henry Lawes, John Hilton, Nicholas Lanier etc. Making not only the composers but the performer additions mainstream would help this ms-century repertoire gain a place beside Purcell and Dowland. The potential for words-and-music combinations in stage shows and semi-opera in the early Restoration is starting to be realised in the light of how to flesh out sketchy source material using performance traditions and techniques that are implicit in manuscripts. Connecting music with place is being done in other areas of music, and has has further potential here. The relationship between treatises and practice is not always straightforward, and mid century England has rich material in both: this is a god test case in when to break and when to follow the rules. Collaboration across genre boundaries does much to illuminate the assumptions and practices behind current performance, which is an essential pre-requisite for research inquiry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7850B8E8-618D-4D31-82DB-D8E86EA043D6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d87d17d8d9a3.33551836</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.elizabethkenny.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F64B35EC-1B0C-4FEA-B7F2-1F8D004D02CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Edinburgh Companion to Literature and Music</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a473c81452bf7a4ac8ba16308ad1ec3"><gtr:id>5a473c81452bf7a4ac8ba16308ad1ec3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kenny, E.R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d832235f6793.56786514</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F0F7D3C-A19B-454F-AE8E-CBB3AB08C19D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shakespeare, Music and Performance</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a473c81452bf7a4ac8ba16308ad1ec3"><gtr:id>5a473c81452bf7a4ac8ba16308ad1ec3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kenny, E.R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d83414649c69.36911383</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M008754/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
