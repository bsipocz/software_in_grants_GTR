Working with the Camden Black Parents and Teachers Association (CBPTA) we plan to use these research results and this new knowledge not only to further the academic study of the subject, but also to reach broader audiences through the creation of new educational resources and teacher support. This will mean that the important academic outcomes of the Money in Africa project extend beyond academe, and have an impact on cultural understanding and educational achievement within and beyond the Black community in Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256158</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>7CB34D68-CB50-48AC-9186-8FDABC2A9805</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-6071813969.008451a70bcff4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Illustrations of African history and civilisations commissioned from Tayo Fatunla</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Impressions of Africa</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>23DDC2E4-9BB4-4184-B2DA-0B61C2492D08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Free exhibition of monetary history of Africa in last 100 years in Rm 69a of the British Museum - 1st April 2010 to 6th February 2011.

The objectives of this project centred around the identified educational needs of African-Caribbean communities in the

UK. Two interlinked areas of work provided targeted educational resources, as well as online resources relating to money

and trade in African history.


A set of educational resources were developed, aimed particularly at

supporting the Key Stage 3 curriculum, but designed to be of use to a wider range of ages than that in some cases. The

educational resources were launched by sernding a poster/flyer sent to every secondary school in the UK in July 2010,

and will be evaluated over the coming 12 months using a questionnaire completed by teachers and tutors who have

downloaded or used them.

Two interlinked areas of work provided targeted educational resources, as well as online resources relating to money and trade in African history. The project Education Officer initially undertook an assessment of the existing resources available for teaching African history in supplementary schools and mainstream schools, and undertook some piloting of educational sessions with groups at the partner organization. Drawing on this, a set of educational resources were developed, aimed particularly at supporting the Key Stage 3 curriculum, but designed to be of use to a wider range of ages than that in some cases. The educational resources were launched by sending a poster/flyer sent to every secondary school in the UK in July 2010, and will be evaluated over the coming 12 months using a questionnaire completed by teachers and tutors who have downloaded or used them. Initial feedback from teachers has been very good. Running in parallel with this, and supporting and feeding into it, work by a Curator of African Money ensured the cataloguing and creation of digital images of the British Museum's collections of modern African currencies. Some of this information and these images then fed into the educational resources, and all of it has been made available through the British Museum's Collections Online website, enabling people around the world to access this important part of the museum's collections. The combination of targeted educational resources and work on the material available on the museum's website and in the Collections Online database, opens up this area of academic study to broader audiences, making the museum's collections, and the information that the museum holds about them, available to the widest possible public. At the same time, the British Museum has benefitted from its partnership with the CBPTA, and learned from them and others more about how it can better meet the needs of African-Caribbean communities in London and the UK, and this will feed into future planning of programmes and projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Development of new approaches to use money and monetary history to inspire learning in schools and after schools clubs.
