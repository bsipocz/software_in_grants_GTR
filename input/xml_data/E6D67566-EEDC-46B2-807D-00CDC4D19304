From academics' lectures and school masterclasses to mathematical features in newspapers and television documentaries, popular books - even mathematicians modelling designer clothes in men's magazines - there has never been more mathematics on display. Mathematics holds an intrinsic fascination for many people, whether they feel they can understand it or whether they feel they are left baffled. However, mathematics is a subject which underpins most of what we take for granted in modern society. This ubiquity, when taken with the way that mathematics naturally becomes incorporated into the disciplines that it informs, means that the fundamental role of mathematics is still under-appreciated. As a consequence, mathematics lacks political punch, is under-funded and generally undervalued by society. The need for professional engagement between mathematicians and the public is therefore crucially important. Despite this, however, the community as a whole has been rather poor at this task, leaving this essential role to just a few skilled individuals. We must tackle this problem in order to help attract future mathematicians to meet the growing demands of industry, commerce and the public sector, and especially to fill the massive shortfall of those going on to teach in schools and FE colleges. Funding is requested for a two-day conference, which aims to bring together mathematicians already active in public engagement (in academe; math promoters; teachers; individuals working in radio, television, newspapers and magazines; and other media) with next generation mathematicians who want to be empowered to be the ambassadors for change. Leading mathematics communicators will speak and then offer interactive workshops for delegates. Topics will include: - Can a respectable professional mathematician engage with the public? - Working with the press and media - Writing a popular maths book - How much maths is too much? - Routes to funding for public engagement - A talent show: 'e to the x factor'.The City of Manchester will provide a perfect venue for a number of street maths events which will be set up in a range of locations around the town. These will link to the conference, helping both to publicise it and also to give additional hands-on examples of maths communication to the participants. The 'Maths in the Street' events will be coordinated by members of the highly experienced organising committee, including Steve Humble, aka Dr Maths of the Northern Echo and Chris Budd who have run many such events around the world, and they will be staffed by local volunteers, delegates and/or students. It is anticipated that this element will encourage BBC Manchester to cover the two-day event, to interview a number of the contributors, and perhaps even to join the panel discussion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>'How to Talk Maths in Public' aims to address the shortage of mathematicians able and willing to engage in all aspects of public engagement. Thus, economic impact, as broadly defined by EPSRC, is at the heart of the proposal. Who will benefit? For the two-day conference: early career mathematics lecturers, postdoctoral researchers, teachers, targeted research students, mathematicians working in industry and commerce, as well as journalists and other media workers with an interest in science and mathematics. The organising committee and speakers will themselves benefit from establishing the 'proof of concept' of transferring good-practice skills in public engagement. For 'Maths in the Street', BCME and BAMC/BMC events: the general public, targeted groups of school children, school and HE teachers and lecturers. From the outputs of the conference (written and electronic): the broad mathematics and science communities, younger researchers, school and FE college teachers, decision makers in government and industry. How will they benefit? Younger mathematicians will be given the tools and the support to undertake public engagement. They will be helped to overcome their initial fears and concerns (and any scepticism as to the value of such activity). Heads of Departments may become more enlightened as to the value of PE aspects of research, and hence offer support staff to increase their engagement activity. Outputs on all aspects of mathematics (pure and applied research, teaching and learning, interdisciplinary work, role and value of mathematics) will be disseminated to a wider audience via media articles, journal and mathematics magazines, and video and audio recordings from the talks/workshops. This audience will include decision makers in government, research councils and industry. The general public and school children will participate in the 'Maths in the Street' activities run in parallel to the conference. School and FE college lecturers will interact with, and gain links to, university staff; hence they will learn of their respective problems and share good practice. What will be done to ensure that they benefit? The success of the project will ultimately rest on four points: (i) good advertising and selection of the best early career staff to attend; (ii) an excellent conference programme; (iii) dissemination of the content and outputs from the workshop; (iv) continuing support mechanism for attendees. Points (i) and (ii) will be dealt with by employing the longstanding expertise of both the organising committee and the IMA (staff and members) in public engagement/maths education and conference organisation. We can be assured of a high quality set of lecturers and workshop leaders, and the 'Maths in the Street' activity will offer excellent 'hands on' PE experience for participants. The School of Mathematics at Manchester will provide an ideal conference venue. To ensure quality, an evaluation report on the conference will compiled by an independent assessor. Point (iii) will be addressed by a variety of actions. First, by ensuring good media attention (TV, radio and printed articles) of the event and of the spin-off PE activity. Second, publication of articles about, or as a result of, the meeting in Mathematics Today, Plus Magazine, i-squared etc. Third, airing of the 'e to the x factor' outputs as well as talks/workshop sessions. Finally, point (iv) is discussed in some detail in the case for support: we aim to establish, with the HE-STEM initiative and STEMNET, a network to offer support, advice, information and mentoring. Participants will be given a resource pack that will offer information and contacts for the whole spectrum of mathematics public engagement and outreach activities. Further, we will explore the possibility of establishing 'next generation' springboard grants, and provide opportunities for next generation PE mathematicians to practice their work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24585</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The overriding objective of the conference was to bring together mathematicians already active in public engagement (in academe; math promoters; teachers; individuals working in radio, television, newspapers and magazines; and other media) with next generation mathematicians who want to be empowered to be the ambassadors for change. 
The benefits of the coinference have been manifold. Several participants have established themselves as active writers of articles popularising mathematics and its applications; others have turned attention to maths busking and similar vehicles for 'getting math out on the streets'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B0B7BCE9-5396-4D4B-A44C-BA49AD599112</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e14fc4648ba3.73369392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overriding objective of the conference was to bring together mathematicians already active in public engagement (in academe; math promoters; teachers; individuals working in radio, television, newspapers and magazines; and other media) with next generation mathematicians who want to be empowered to be the ambassadors for change. During the conference, our aim was that the participants gain information in, and 'hands on' practice of, at least several of the following: engaging with the public, writing for and working with the press and media, writing a popular maths book, pitching a mathematics talk correctly, giving public interviews, obtaining funding for public engagement etc.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The legacy of the conference has been a support network of trained and motivated individuals. The meeting also led directly to a number of individuals who are new to PE work becoming actively engaged in such activities. These include many outlets: podcasts, Maths Busking (www.mathsbusking.com) and production of articles aimed at increasing the community's awareness of the subject. It is hoped that 'How to Talk Maths in Public' will be repeated on a regular basis.
Another output of this conference has been a close working relationship between Abrahams and a number of key public engagers in mathematics; for example Abrahams and CJ Budd (Bath) ran the inaugural 2-day &amp;quot;Festival of Mathematics&amp;quot; at Manchester in July 2014.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3D5CE7F6-AD7E-4207-93A8-C787DC10EE14</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464b8b20abbc4.07569473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ima.org.uk/viewItem.cfm-cit_id=383843.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H046852/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
