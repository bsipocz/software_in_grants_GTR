Group around a series of events linking the company's history and that of the French resort town of
Hardelot. The research took place between 2008 and 2013. Impact activities began in 2011 and
are ongoing. The project benefited Tata Group by providing material for use in public relations and
in consciousness-raising among its large workforce. The citizens of Hardelot benefited from the
promotion of tourism, a new perspective on their history, and enhanced civic identity. The research
made leaders in industry and government aware of the history of Franco-Indian economic
relations, and was accepted as offering a new point of reference for future business dialogue.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e092627ac953.31842037-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The activities detailed below enriched the cultural life of the population of Hardelot itself, of French
and international visitors to the town, and of the employees of Tata Group. They enabled public
exploration of a previously little-known connection between France and India, including the first
case of an Indian company investing in France, prompting reflection on issues related to the future
challenges of globalization in France.
1. Major public exhibition
The first and principal outcome of the collaboration was an exhibition displayed on a series of
large-format all-weather panels (for confidentiality reasons this link is password-protected), 
and sited along the primary pedestrian access route
from the town centre to Hardelot Beach at the height of the summer season from 24 June to 24
September 2011. Anticipating its importance for the town's prestige and future heritage tourism
from India, the Mayor's office and the Hardelot Tourist Office allocated US$ 21,000 to support the
events. TG matched this funding, in the interests of its company profile in France and Europe. The
Tourist Office and the Mayor decided to make the exhibition the centrepiece of Hardelot's cultural
offering throughout the summer of 2011, and all official events, from public lectures and fashion
shows to hands-on art workshops for children aged 4 to 6, had an Indian theme that year. A full colour
brochure publicising the exhibition and these events, and including all dates and times, was
prepared by the Tourist Office. The opening ceremony on 29 July 2011 was attended by locals
from Hardelot (some of whom live in the properties once owned by the Tatas), the Chief of Mission
at the Indian Embassy in Paris, the Mayor of Hardelot, the regional Head of Tata Communications,
and a chief archivist from TCA, Pune, India.
In the event, some 14,000 visitors, both locals and tourists from other parts of France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and the UK viewed the exhibition. It was also covered extensively in the media. The
coverage included a feature on France 3 Television broadcast as part of the evening news bulletin
on 29 July 2011. This included a short interview with Magedera and with locals expressing their
attachment to their town's connection with India. Two locals testify to the fact that before the
exhibition they did not know who the Tatas were, how many properties they owned in the town, or
how important TG had become. In India, through a copyright exchange agreement, Tata Central
Archives - India's oldest company archive and a key beneficiary - has been able to enhance its
collections with the material from the exhibition and make it available to people in India.

2. Public outreach and capacity building
The research for this project also unearthed how, during the First World War, the British Indian
Army set up a hospital in a Hardelot hotel to treat injured Indian soldiers (panel 11 of the exhibition
was devoted to this period). Archival research done under Magedera's guidance in the UK by Dr
William Leigh (a mature undergraduate student in History at the University of Liverpool), led to an
illustrated public lecture on &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Les soldats indiens &amp;agrave; Hardelot pendant la Grande Guerre &amp;gt;&amp;gt;, delivered
by Dr Leigh in Hardelot on 5 August 2011. This event was hosted in a municipal meeting room and
attended by twenty-five Hardelotois and by members of the Conseil des sages, a group of senior
business and public sector figures. A further demonstration of the exhibition's successful capacity
building is that, through the involvement of local officials and news media, it raised awareness of
the presence of First-World-War Indian war graves in the region during a commemoration visit to
Hardelot by Commonwealth academics (from Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada), 15-16
September 2011 (see Sources to corroborate the impact, below).
3. Legacy impact in 2012: permanent display of exhibition panels
In February 2012, Tata Communications (a multinational telecommunications infrastructure
company with 7,700 staff and a revenue of US$ 2.6 billion in 2011) requested permission to
reproduce fifteen of the exhibition panels for permanent display in the staff offices of their
European headquarters in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. Fifty key personnel are employed at this
site. This represents acknowledgement of the potential of the exhibition panels to support
corporate identity in a multinational environment.
4. Legacy impact in 2013: the exhibition contextualizes trade relations between Europe and
India
Magedera's research and its dissemination have opened up new channels for dialogue in
international business by raising awareness of the history of interchanges between France and
India. On 28 March 2013, the External Trade Commission of Brittany hosted a conference on TG,
entitled Rencontre entre Inde et Bretagne, which emphasized France's role in TG's early
internationalization. After viewing the exhibition panels in Hardelot, External Trade Commissioner
Jean-Claude Breton chose the panels to form a physical centrepiece at the conference venue.
Keynote speakers at the conference included Mr Anwar Hasan (the Head of Tata UK) and Mr B.
Muthuraman (Vice Chairman of Tata Steel). Impact from this research is ongoing. Although outside
the census period, it is important to note that the exhibition started a nationwide tour on 14
September 2013 with a two-week display in Morlaix, Brittany, followed by a one-week display in
Lorient, Brittany. It will subsequently visit Paris and Lille, and a number of other major centres to be
confirmed.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Ian Magedera carried out all of the research detailed in this case study while in post at
Liverpool. Tata Group (TG) is an Indian multinational enterprise founded in 1868. With its UK
workforce of 45,000 at Jaguar Land Rover and other companies, TG is the largest foreign
employer in this country, where it has been active since 1907. TG's first investments in Europe
were made in Hardelot, around the time of the town's foundation in 1905 as a private resort on the
Channel coast. The research which underpins this case study began in 2008, when the hitherto unexplored
presence of Tata in Europe was revealed as a result of Magedera's research into the life of the
Frenchwoman, Suzanne Bri&amp;egrave;re (1880-1923). She featured in a wider project on non-English
European women ('Indian Videshini') who have attained positions of leadership in India since the
1890s. This in turn developed out of an AHRC-funded study of Representations of India in French
Literature and Culture that commenced in 2006 (item 1 in References to the research, below).
Bri&amp;egrave;re's husband, R.D. Tata, was one of the four original partners of TG. With their family of five
children, the Tatas played an active part in Hardelot between its foundation in 1905 and the start of
the First World War in 1914. Magedera's initial research on Suzanne Bri&amp;egrave;re was carried out at Tata
Central Archives (TCA) in Pune, India, in 2008. From December 2010, Magedera also made two
research visits to Hardelot to evaluate local sources relating to TG.
Among the materials found in India and France were postcards and other correspondence which
threw light on the ways in which Suzanne Bri&amp;egrave;re negotiated her dual French-Indian identity in
linguistic and cultural terms. This became the subject of a 2013 book chapter by Magedera (item 2
in References to the research, below). A further significant finding arose from Magedera's
examination both of property deeds relating to TG's investments and of the testimony of those who
ran the Hardelot holding company. These indicate that investment by this branch of the Tata family
in Hardelot extended beyond private interests to the purchase of commercial properties in the
company's name in 1905, possibly the first case of inward investment into Europe by an Indian
company. New insights into the dialogue between European culture and Indian industry emerged
from exploration of the links between Hardelot and the automotive and aviation industries. Driving
and flying were publicized as key leisure activities in Hardelot, and these became both personal
passions and important business concerns of TG. The aviator-entrepreneur Louis Bl&amp;eacute;riot and his
pilots landed their aeroplanes on the hard sand beach at low tide. Suzanne Bri&amp;egrave;re made her
maiden flight in 1913 and her son spent his childhood among aeroplanes. In 1932, he founded 
Tata Indian Airways, which became Air India in 1953. Not surprisingly, the concentration in
Hardelot of prominent business families such as the Merciers (champagne), the Bl&amp;eacute;riots (aviation),
and others representing manufacturing and textiles, meant that the resort functioned as a locus of
technology transfer. More generally, this research contributed to the argument that Magedera
developed in his book chapter (item 2 in References to the research, below), that Indian elites have
maintained their position in the face of multiple challenges by strategically incorporating foreigners
of a particular kind.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Les Militaires indiens a Hardelot pendant la Grande Guerre</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FFF8904-1355-4A6D-9B68-D1D44BC461A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research for this project also unearthed how, during the First World War, the British Indian

First, in addition to the academic publications, the award surveyed the range and depth of French-language representations of India and how they were affected by the minor coloniser status of the French and British hegemony in S. Asia during the British Raj. The survey has borne a digital resource frenchbooksonindia.wordpress.com (and its predecessor sites) which has galvanized over 60 academic and non-academic volunteers from sixth-formers to professors to web designers and photographers around the world to find sources, to edit them and to provide original scholarly content such as summaries in French and English. French Books on India has the potential to become a new model for the critical and collaborative digital humanities.

Second, the full extent of the French presence in India was established. Initially the project began with a hypothesis that the French were subaltern colonizers, colonized in some way by the British as the French exerted sovereignty over groups of Indians in the 507 square kilometres of territory that they controlled. The project established that they (and other European powers such as the Portuguese, Dutch and the Danes) should be considered as minor colonizers in India. The study of their contribution is as crucial to develop a complete history of India-Europe relations.

Third, the research had unexpected, unplanned outcomesin the economic and cultural domain because it focused not only on cultural artefacts such as books, but also on people as go-betweens between two (France and India) or even three cultures (France, India and Britain). These impacts are detailed in the Narrative Impact Section.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Historians of India in India and in Europe and North America can use our conclusions and methods for the study of the other minor colonizers in India such as the Portuguese, the Danes and the Dutch. The full and complete understanding of the relations between India and Europe is essential for an emerging nation which is as important as India in global terms. This has been recognized by the British Council and by the establishment of the UK-India Education and Research Initiative and the University of Liverpool's own India Fellowships programme.
