and maintain our position within the external world. This competence includes psychological
needs and generic personal effectiveness skills which are not necessarily readily available to
individuals. These difficulties can be more evident in more organized environments such as
Schools, Universities and in general Higher Education (HE) institutions as well as in Business
and other work situations.
Many techniques are employed in clinical and educational environments aiming to assist
individuals with specific needs which vary in severity. But such techniques are generally
offered piecemeal and on a one to one or written basis. Use is not made of modern internet
with video techniques despite it being well established that those with, for example, dyslexia
or psychological difficulties can often learn better through an audiovisual input and that many
people will prefer to address these difficulties through learning structured techniques and
skills in a private/personal environment on the internet.
The arrival of effective video techniques in IT presents the opportunity to provide a personal
private web-based skill learning system, mySkillPal. Through an online questionnaire about
an individual?s needs, specific techniques will be offered from modules based on particular
difficulties to address the continuous learning needs of the individual. We envisage offering
mySkillPal through four significant markets; Higher Education Institutions, Schools, Work
and Health; initially in the UK but also internationally.
iConcipio has chosen to develop mySkillPal firstly for the HE market where the founder is
experienced and because HE institutions have an acknowledged student welfare role. Students
are recognised to face many problems and situations as they generally leave home and seek to
become fully independent whilst facing a demanding student learning and examination
process. In 2008 drop out rates at UK Universities were above 22% and are far higher in
science based subjects (&amp;pound;13,684 per student), the most expensive courses to run at
Universities. MySkillPal will be offered to HE institutions as a ?free? student support service
at an annual access fee based on the number of students.
Since the competition in the last month we have secured Kings? commitment to work with
iConcipio to develop a feasibility model of the website and a small selection of techniques so
that the business concept can be demonstrated to potential HE customers as a basic prototype
and so that its effectiveness can be tested and trialled by students.
Grant funding is being applied for to help finance the development of this feasibility model.
With the founders limited personal resources the receipt of the grant will facilitate rapid
development of the opportunity and enable investors to have confidence in the potential
success of the business.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710060</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
