A lot of
evidence exists to indicate that this brain damage is due to an inflammatory process involving the
production of a chemical called interferon. Interferon is normally produced by cells in response to
infection by a virus, and some children with AGS are initially misdiagnosed as having a viral-related disease because of the close clinical overlap of these states. In contrast to the production of interferon
secondary to virus, in AGS an excess of interferon occurs due to a primary genetic defect. Because of
the severity of the condition there is an urgent need to develop new treatments for AGS. We think this
should be possible if we better understand how the responsible genetic changes drive interferon
production.
We intend to use the very latest genetic and cell technologies to understand how brain cells are
damaged by inflammation in AGS. AGS is rare, and few parents feel able to agree to post-mortem if
their affected child dies. However, a family with affected twin girls has generously donated the brain of
one of their very recently deceased daughters. This almost unique resource will allow us to study
human neurological tissue in more detail than ever before, and using new techniques which have not
been available previously. Additionally, we are going to make use of state-of-the-art methods for
producing 'brain cells' in a test-tube - derived from cells of patients with AGS, so that we can study
brain tissue in the context of several different genetic sub-types of AGS. We also intend to analyse a
strain of mouse which has changes in one of the AGS-related genes as another approach to trying to
understand the human disease.
Although AGS is rare, the study of the genes and the proteins related to the disease has become of
very high scientific importance - partly because of the involvement of these genes / proteins in how
the body reponds to infection byHIV-1 (the virus that causes AIDS), and also because of an overlap
with diseases where the body attacks itself - so-called autoimmunity. Thus, not only will our work be relevant to the children and families affected by this dreadful condition, it may also have relevance for a much wider set of human medical disorders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Studies of Aicardi-Gouti&amp;egrave;res syndrome (AGS) have proven of major scientific importance by directly informing the biology of infection - particularly HIV-1 (e.g. Nat Immunol 2010; 11: 1005-13; Nature 2011; 474: 654-7), interferon metabolism (e.g. Cell 2008; 134: 587-98), DNA maintenance (e.g. Cell
2012; 149: 1008-22; Nature 10.1038/nature13292), and retroelements (e.g. Nat Immunol 2014; 15:415-422). AGS is undoubtedly a neuroinflammatory disease, as evidenced by its remarkable clinical mimicry of in utero viral infection (e.g. Dev Med Child Neurol 2008; 50: 410-6), a robust association with elevated cerebrospinal fluid white cell counts, intrathecal overproduction of the
primary antiviral cytokine interferon (e.g. J Neurol Sci 1988;84:201-8) and the inflammatory marker neopterin (Dev Med Child Neurol 2009; 51: 317-23), the recent observation of brain-reactive
autoantibodies (Ann Rheum Dis annrheumdis-2014-205396), and the notable observation of a
progressive inflammatory encephalopathy in a transgenic mouse model chronically producing
interferon alpha from astrocytes - which recapitulates the neuroimaging and pathological features of AGS, and some viral encephalopathies, to a remarkable degree (J Immunol 1998; 161: 5016-26; Brain Res 1999; 835: 46-61). Although much is now understood about the genetic basis of AGS, very little is known of the
mechanics of innate and adaptive immune system engagement directly relevant to the, primary,
neurological phenotype - not least because, considering the sensitivities around infant post-mortem examination, particularly where a diagnosis has already been reached, neurological tissue from
patients affected by AGS is extremely scarce. Here we propose a multidisciplinary study of AGSassociated neuroinflammation. Our project, combining expertise of high order (spanning mouse and
human biology), involves a portfolio of complementary but discrete approaches - thus mitigating risks
related to any one particular aspect of the roject. In pursuing these studies, including the use of stateof-the-art iPSC and deep sequencing technologies, we will derive data informing the future treatment of the devastating AGS phenotype (across all the recognised genotypes), and which may also be relevant to our understanding of congenital infection, the biology of HIV-1, and neuro-lupus.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279555</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Neuropathology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration as part of ERA-NET consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEA00EE2-16AC-42C3-9236-6217FAFD647C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contribution to a common manuscript (Meuwissen et al.

Clinically, SAMHD1-related AGS differs from other AGS subtypes in that many patients demonstrate a cerebral vasculopathy and are prone to intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and stroke [2-4]. The pathological basis of this phenotype is predicted to relate to a discrete role for SAMHD1 in neurovascular homeostasis - likely through an immune/inflammatory-mediated mechanism. We, and others, have started to define the biochemical function of SAMHD1 in relation to immunity; however, an understanding of a regulatory role for SAMHD1 in the neurovasculature remains unclear. Mutant SAMHD1 mice have been generated, but these mice do not exhibit neurovascular disease [5, 6]. In contrast, using an antisense morpholino approach, we recently published a temporal samhd1 gene knockdown zebrafish embryo model, apparently recapitulating the cerebrovascular and innate immune phenotypes observed in AGS [7]. However, morpholinos cannot integrate into the genome, so that permanent genetic modification is impossible using this strategy. Thus, for long-term investigation a genetically stable mutant samhd1 model is necessary and has been the initial focus of our ERA-NET related-work in Manchester. Although this work was not originally envisaged as part of the ERA-NET application, we consider that the possibility to derive an animal model recapitulating the neuro-inflammatory features associated with the human disease due to SAMHD1 mutations can be fully justified within this remit. Considering the insights that a zebrafish animal model of inflammatory cerebrovascular disease might afford, we decided to try to develop a stable loss of function SAMHD1 system. Three mutant samhd1 lines are now available in Manchester (1 x ENU mutant, 2 x CRISPR). Due to the nature of the human condition and the samhd1 morphant phenotype, severe developmental phenotypes were expected in homozygous mutants for each of these three lines. However, all homozygotes are viable and survive to adulthood. Exploration for subtle/mild phenotypes have been performed primarily in one mutant line - the CRISPR/Cas9-induced 23bp deletion line - details of which are described below.

Embryos injected (F0) with gRNA specific for exon 4 of the zebrafish samhd1 gene and Cas9 RNA were assessed for indels using restriction diagnostics and raised to adulthood before outcrossing onto a WT background (F1). F1 genotyping identified the presence of two heterozygous mutant alleles - a 2bp deletion and 23bp deletion. Both alleles are predicted to cause truncation of the translated protein. Heterozygous F1 fish were grown to adulthood and subsequently incrossed to test for homozygosity. Phenotypic assessments have focussed on the 23bp deletion line. Gross developmental abnormalities were assessed in mixed genotype clutches however no genotype:phenotype correlations were observed. Due to the retention of maternal RNA/proteins in larval yolk, early developmental phenotypes are often inhibited until the yolk gradually recedes over the first few days of life. To test for this, we performed survival analyses between 5 and 14 days post-fertilisation; however no significant trend for homozygous lethality was observed. Indeed, homozygous mutants (F1 and F2) are viable, breed and survive to over 12 months of age. Whole brains from three age-matched (~13 months) WT, heterozygous and homozygous siblings have been harvested, fixed and sectioned and histological analysis will be performed to assess for neurovascular/inflammatory pathology. Defective swimming was observed in a single homozygous mutant. 

As SAMHD1-related AGS5 is associated with an increased risk for ICH and a significant proportion of samhd1 morphant zebrafish larvae exhibit brain haemorrhage [7], we tested for brain bleeding phenotypes in mutant samhd1 siblings using the haemoglobin stain, o-dianisidine, during larval stages. No significant haemorrhaging was observed in any genotype using this particular assay. In an attempt to identify structural defects within the neurovasculature, the samhd1 23bp deletion allele has recently been crossed onto a kdrl:mCherry transgenic reporter background [8] to allow for observations of blood vessel formation in the brain. This line will be available for assessment within the next 3 months.
Increased expression of type I IFN signature genes (ISGs) is a biochemical hallmark of all AGS subtypes [9]. Additionally, we have shown temporal gene knockdown of samhd1 is associated with significant upregulation of putative zebrafish ISG expression [7]. Therefore, to determine whether germline mutation of samhd1 in zebrafish also induces a type I IFN signature, we performed quantitative PCR on WT and homozygous mutant siblings. Fish were harvested and RNA was extracted at 5, 14 and 28 days post-fertilisation (dpf) and qPCR was performed using a previously established panel of Taqman probes [7]. At each time point, increased expression of some of the genes was observed in homozygotes, however inconsistencies between genes and ages exist. To further investigate the potential significance of the inflammatory response observed in homozygotes, we treated larvae with Poly (I:C) - a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule which is commonly used to evoke type I IFN signalling [10]. RNA from untreated and treated larvae were harvested at 5dpf. As before, untreated homozygotes exhibited increased expression of some of the genes within our panel in comparison to WT. Poly (I:C) treatment stimulated increased expression of many of the genes within this panel, and a trend for augmented expression was observed in homozygotes. However, inconsistencies exist, and investigations are ongoing using other stimulation techniques. Morpholino knockdown of samhd1 was also associated with increased expression of the zebrafish type I IFN, ifnphi1 [7]. Therefore, the samhd1 23bp deletion has been crossed onto the ifnphi1:mCherry transgenic reporter background and will be ready for assessment in 2 months.

To determine the effects of the 23bp deletion on protein translation, we have performed western blotting on WT and homozygote siblings using established protocols [7]. Unfortunately, we have experienced significant issues with antibody specificity and/or recognition of the samhd1 protein. Numerous antibody batches have been tested from a range of suppliers. However, we have still not obtained a satisfactory result to date. We are currently discussing the possibility of generating custom-made, zebrafish specific anti-samhd1 antibodies to address this problem.

The potential type I IFN defect and lack of neurovascular phenotype observed in mutant samhd1 zebrafish resembles the situation in mice [5, 6]. However due to the known phenomenon of genetic compensation that is frequently experienced in stable mutant zebrafish lines [11], it is still possible that further genetic interrogation may lead to a clinically-relevant disease model. Of potential relevance, the samhd1-like gene is a recently annotated zebrafish transcript that might function as a paralogue of samhd1. Structurally, the translated samhd1-like protein shares significant homology to the C-terminal of samhd1. Of possible note, mutant constructs resembling this paralogue retain HIV restriction activity when overexpressed in cells [12], indicating that the function of this protein might be comparable to samhd1 itself - in which case it is possible that expression of samhd1-like could compensate for loss of samhd1 in homozygous mutants. Precedent for this theory exists in the literature, in a tdp43/tdp43-like double mutant model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [13]. Although genomic sequences are highly homologous, differences exist and 5 mismatches in the target sequence used for the samhd1 gRNA and the same region in samhd1-like are present. Sequence analysis using samhd1-like-specific primers indicates that the WT transcript exists in homozygous mutant animals. Given these data, new samhd1-like-specific gRNA has been generated and we are now developing a samhd1/samhd1-like double mutant line which will then be assessed for neurovascular defects.
