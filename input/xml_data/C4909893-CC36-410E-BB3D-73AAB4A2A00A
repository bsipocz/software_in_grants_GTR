The ingredients of a semigroup are a set (i.e. a collection of symbols) along with an operation, often called multiplication, defined on this set (i.e. a method for combining pairs of elements from the set to get new elements from that set). For a semigroup this operation must be associative, which means that when we multiply a string of elements from the set together it does not matter how the terms are bracketed. A very easy example is to take the set of natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ... etc. along with the operation of addition +. Of course, if a, b and c are natural numbers then (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) and so this gives an example of a semigroup. Far more complicated and interesting examples of semigroup exist than this one. One thing that does make this example slightly interesting is the fact that it is an infinite semigroup. A more interesting example of an infinite semigroup is a so called free semigroup . We begin with a set A called an alphabet, say for example we let A be the set containing the letters a,b and c. We then consider all words we can make by stringing together letters of the alphabet (note that these are not words in the usual sense, since they do not need to have any meaning). In our example abc is a word, as is bbcabcbcba. If we take the set of all possible words along with the operation of concatenation (joining together) of words then we obtain a semigroup, called the free semigroup over the alphabet A. So for example we can multiply the word abc with the word bcc to obtain the word abcbcc. Taking this one stage further we come to the concept of a semigroup presentation . A semigroup presentation is given by an alphabet, like we had for the free semigroup above, along with a set of pairs of words R called relations. The pairs of words in R are usually written with an equals sign separating them. For example we could take A to be the set with a,b and c as our alphabet, as above, and let R be the set of relations abc = a and bca = a. These relations may now be applied to words transforming one word into another. For example, we can apply the relation abc = a to the word cabcabcccbc to obtain the word cabcaccbc (we replaced abc which appears in the middle of the first word by the word a since abc = a is one of our relations). In this way we create sets of words that are equivalent to one another in the sense that we can move between them by applying the rules from R. We can now consider these sets of words as objects and, in the natural way, we can define an operation of multiplication on these objects. The resulting structure is a semigroup and we call it the semigroup defined by the presentation (A,R). If the sets A and R may be chosen to be finite then the semigroup is said to be finitely presented . Every finite semigroup is finitely presented but there are also many infinite semigroups that are also finitely presented. As a result presentations are a very useful tool for working with infinite semigroups because, in many situations, they give us a way of representing an infinite object, the semigroup, using a finite amount of information, the presentation. This research project is centred around the study of infinite semigroups via presentations. Given a semigroup, any other semigroup that can be found inside that semigroup is called a subsemigroup. One of the main aims of this research project is to consider the relationship between the properties of infinite semigroups (represented using presentations) and those of its subsemigroups. In particular my interest is in developing methods for measuring the difference in size between a semigroup and its substructures. This measurement should have the property that when the semigroup and subsemigroup are measured to be close together they will share may algebraic, combinatorial and computational properties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>203055</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture series at St Andrews Summer Research School 2008</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC7D9C8A-CE0C-44BD-AAAC-0CD8D2852AFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These lectures were based on research topics being studied as part of the research of the fellowship.

Numerous undergraduate and postgraduate students benefited from the fellowship. In particular: 

(1) During the fellowship the fellow gave a series of lectures entitled &amp;quot;Residual Finiteness of Algebraic Structures'' as part of the &amp;quot;St Andrews Summer Research School 2008&amp;quot;. These lectures were based on research topics being studied as part of the research of the fellowship. The aim of the summer school was to give talented undergraduate students (going into the last year of their degree) a chance to spend a few weeks over the summer getting a flavour of what research level mathematics is like, and to encourage them to go on to Masters and PhD level studies in mathematics. Many of the students that attended this summer school went on to do PhD studies in mathematics in several different universities across the UK. 

(2) During the fellowship the fellow assisted with the supervision of two PhD students, Simon Craik and Jay McPhee. Both of these students successfully completed their PhDs and have now started successful careers in the private sector. 

Benefit to the career development of the fellow: 

The project allowed the fellow to develop as in independent researcher, creating strong national and international research links. In particular, the support provided by the grant allowed the fellow to travel, to conduct collaborative research, and to disseminate his work at conferences. Eight presentations (six invited) were given by the fellow during the fellowship, including an invitation to speak at the ESI Institute, Vienna, Austria; 2 invited talks at the University of Lisbon, Portugal; and contributed talks at international conferences in Tunisia and the USA. By allowing the fellow to develop his international research profile in this way, this led to him winning a five year personal fellowship at the University of Lisbon and then, ultimately, to him moving back to the UK in 2013 to take up a permanent lectureship position at the University of East Anglia.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DAE5132E-B2CE-4ACB-A646-B3E2C7876C02</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461e3dccc7168.13422830</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a three year EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellowship held at an early stage of the fellow's research career. He worked on the project for 2 years at which point he ended the fellowship early to take up a 5 year personal fellowship at the University of Lisbon. 

The fellowship project was in algebra, specifically combinatorial and geometric group and semigroup theory. The main aim of the project was to investigate the relationships between finiteness conditions of semigroups and their substructures, and related notions of index. Important properties investigated include: finite presentability, residual finiteness, automaticity, being presentable by a finite complete rewriting system (a concept in theoretical computer science), and related homological finiteness properties FPn and FDT. 

All main aims of the original proposal were achieved. In addition, many other related results were proved, and new lines of investigation opened up. The research generated by the project led to 19 research articles published by the fellow in leading international journals with referee, both in mathematics and theoretical computer science journals. This work was done in collaboration with researchers at several universities in the UK (Manchester, Glasgow, Leeds, St Andrews), and international collaborators from Portugal, Australia, and Iceland. A summary of some of the significant new knowledge generated by the project is given below. 

GREEN INDEX: This new idea provides a common generalisation of group and Rees index, achieving one of the main objectives of the proposal. Results established during the fellowship show that many important finiteness properties are preserved under finite Green index substructures and extensions. 

HOMOLOGICAL FINITENESS PROPERTIES: With Pride (Glasgow) and Malheiro (Lisbon), a mixture of positive results and counterexamples obtained, including: a regular monoid with finitely many left and right ideals has FDT if and only if all of its maximal subgroups do, and such a monoid inherits the homological finiteness property FP3 from its maximal subgroups. Surprisingly, FPn is not inherited by maximal subgroups with finite translational index in general, but is by subgroups contained in completely simple minimal ideals. 

MAXIMAL SUBGROUPS: With Ruskuc (St Andrews) we proved that every group is a maximal subgroup of some free idempotent generated semigroup, completely refuting a 30 year old conjecture that every such group is free. This was a breakthrough result in this area, providing an entirely new approach. We also applied our new methods to solve the corresponding problem for the full transformation monoid. 

GEOMETRIC SEMIGROUP THEORY: This is a very exciting new direction of research, inspired by ideas encountered in the infinite graph theory research conducted by the fellow. In joint work with Kambites (Manchester) we study groups acting on spaces equipped with asymmetric, partially-defined distance functions. We introduce a natural notion of quasi-isometry for such spaces and exhibit an extension of the Svarc-Milnor Lemma to this setting. We apply our results to show a number of important properties of monoids are quasi-isometry invariants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the research outcomes of this project have been taken forward by other researchers working in related areas. For example: 

(1) &amp;quot;Green index and finiteness conditions for semigroups&amp;quot;, R Gray, N Ruskuc (2008) led to results on Sierpinski rank and Strong distortion [Mitchell and Peresse, 2011]; on having rational word problem [Pfeiffer, 2013]; and on the properties of being Markov and hopfian [Cain and Maltcev, 2014]. 

(2) &amp;quot;On maximal subgroups of free idempotent generated semigroups&amp;quot;, R Gray, N Ruskuc (2012) led to results on free idempotent generated semigroups over bands [Dolinka, 2012], [Gould, Yang, 2014]; the partial transformation monoid [Dolinka, 2013]; and endomorphism monoids of free G-sets [Gould, Yang, 2013], [Dolinka, Gould, Yang, 2014]. Some of these results formed part of D. Yang's 2014 PhD thesis. 

(3) &amp;quot;Locally-finite connected-homogeneous digraphs&amp;quot;, R Gray, R. G. M?ller (2011) led to classification results for connected-homogeneous digraphs [Hamann, Hundertmark, 2013], [Hamann, 2014]. 

The output &amp;quot;Groups acting on semimetric spaces and quasi-isometries of monoids&amp;quot;, R Gray, M Kambites (2013), has opened up an exciting new direction of geometric semigroup theory. This area is still in its infancy, and has the potentially to be developed in many interesting directions in future
