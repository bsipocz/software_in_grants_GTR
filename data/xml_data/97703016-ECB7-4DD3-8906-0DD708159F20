This makes deaf people's English acquisition, which is very difficult (Kempt &amp;amp; Maxwell 1989; Schmitz &amp;amp; Keenan 2005), virtually impossible in many locations. This pilot project aims to provide English-language teaching for members of the deaf community in India including deaf young people in high poverty contexts, and draft a model of effective language-teaching interventions for them, to guide policy and further innovation. The focus is improving the quality of educational outcomes for a specific community which may not derive adequate benefit from traditional interventions. Peer education can lead to improved academic and cognitive abilities for both learners and tutors, and decreased absenteeism and isolation (Bruffee 1978; Falchikov 2001). The project proposes a model which departs from existing traditional language teaching practices in India, and takes an ethnographic approach which will see the development of materials and teaching led by local deaf tutors supported by trainers both in-country and from the UK, to ensure responsiveness to learner needs. It is an interdisciplinary collaboration between specialists in (applied) sign linguistics/Deaf Studies, TESOL, cross-cultural research on literacies, and learning technologists. The development of a virtual/mobile learning platform (Sign Language to English by the Deaf - SLEND) combined with the use of sign language and support from deaf peer tutors constitute a learner-driven, innovative methodology based on a functional approach to learning that will emphasise using language to do things (rather than grammar-driven). Adaptation of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) for the expression of learning outcomes will allow achievements to be expressed in terms of an internationally understood tool. To examine transferability across cultures, small-scale investigative fieldwork will take place in Uganda and Ghana to reveal literacy needs there and pave the way for future South-South collaboration. 
Using mixed methods from action research and ethnographic research, the project addresses the following research questions:
1. How can we develop and implement a deaf-led, community based, learner-focussed teaching programme that meets local community needs in a sustainable way? 
2. How can we capture and measure, in a standardised way, the effectiveness of the combination of peer tuition, a dedicated virtual learning environment, and a staged training programme on teaching English literacy in this particular socio-cultural context? 
3. How can we best understand and conceptualise the interrelated elements that characterise this approach and how they interact to facilitate effective teaching in this context? Qualitative data including classroom observations, analysis of interactions on the SLEND, and interviews inform the answers to this question. Community teachers/peer tutors will be trained in data collection and analysis, enhancing the research capacity of the deaf community. 
In India, the study has four overlapping phases: (1) Ethnographic study into existing literacy practices to identify the types of communication which are valued by deaf sign language users proceeds alongside (2) content development based on this needs assessment. Course delivery (3) is then carried out by local tutors with pre- and post- assessment to measure learner attainment. Compiling the interim and final quantitative-qualitative evidence for dissemination (4) informs national policy and ensures the project's on-going influence.
In Uganda and Ghana, smaller case studies into literacy needs and practices will be carried out using the same ethnographic research tools. Focus groups in these countries alongside dissemination workshops will review the SLEND and discuss possible adaptation/scalability to teaching situations in deaf communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At present, much of the human and intellectual potential of India's one million deaf signers is being wasted because their instructors teach in spoken language, and thus they are unable to attain basic English literacy, a vital component of economic and career success in modern India and globally. The programme benefits deaf people who have inadequate interpreter provision or who lack the funding or skills necessary to access traditional education. Peer education by deaf signers, and course materials in sign language, will give these individuals full access to learning English. Skills in written English open a multitude of doors for deaf people in terms of exploiting technology, further education, employment, and an enriched social life, as suggested by previous work with deaf Indians carried out by iSLanDS under the UK-India Education and Research Initiative. This will extend the pedagogy flexibly in India, with potential for South-South collaboration among deaf learners in Ghana and Uganda. National, regional and local policies will be recommended by the research team in order to support and scale up sustainable educational initiatives, based on real-life literacies in deaf communities. The economic and societal impact of this project is maximised through the involvement of deaf individuals in every aspect, from researcher to learner. Deaf people, especially in the developing world, have a high unemployment rate and low educational attainment. By improving their employability, this programme is of social and economic benefit to each of the countries. It builds capacity by giving the peer educators valuable job experience and increasing access to education and employment for all both tutors and learners. The peer educators will gain a deeper understanding of English, enabling them to act as role models. The Indian staff will receive technical training and research experience. By having the data collection carried out by local deaf people, the project capitalises on grassroots expertise and capacity growth. National policy will be influenced and on-going impact secured through assessment evidence and publications, and the investigation of scalability for extension. Publications, evidence from assessments and programme evaluations can be used to demonstrate to policy makers the validity and effectiveness of the methodology in terms of achievement and learner reaction. Publications will focus on literary practices in the target community, development of literacy needs and the use of the CEFR to guide teaching and record learner achievement of deaf learners. Cross-cultural comparisons of literacy practices and drafts of implementation models will be presented to policy-makers and practitioners, and later refined in a larger-scale project. Adapting the CEFR will enable internationally comparable assessment and empirical measurement of the programme's effectiveness, and provide evidence that learners can use to demonstrate their achievement levels to employers. Partnership with the NAD and other deaf organisations is central to engagement with stakeholders, to verify that deaf people in the target countries have the opportunity to benefit from the project. At our dissemination workshops in India, Ghana and Uganda and an international conference in India, we will plan sustainable, deaf-led communicative channels to manage the project's legacy and ensure the capacity-building and policy impacts have lasting value.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126173</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a 34-minute documentary film about the research project.

We disseminated outcomes to wider audiences via events and outputs including the'4th India Deaf Expo' (Coimbatore), the Impact Initiative's workshop on 'Establishing a dialogue on disability for higher impact' (Cambridge, Co-I Panda and RA Manavalamamuni), an online article for the Association of Commonwealth Universities Engage Community (Co-I Gillen), participation in a cross-sectoral consultation meeting on 'Teaching, Learning and Disadvantage - from policy to practice' (New Delhi, Co-I Panda with two NGO representatives), and a summary report for general audiences for the blog and website (www.deafliteracy.net). Moreover, the SLEND (Sign Language to English by the Deaf) online learning platform has been archived as a legacy site. 

To make our approach more accessible to stakeholders, we produced a 45-minute documentary film about our project together with Indian deaf filmmakers, and screened it at the final dissemination conference in India. A short 10-minute feature film by deaf actors and directors entitled 'Hello literacy!' was also produced. 

The following impacts are notable:

(a) NGO sector impact. The research results are now being used in a feasibility study by an Indian NGO in the disability sector (V-shesh), in order to assess how skills in business English can be taught to their deaf clients who seek entry to the skilled labour markets in India. v-shesh are preparing a feasibility report for the &amp;quot;India Prosperity Fund&amp;quot; programme operated by the UK High Commission (due by the end of 2016) and are using our results to make detailed plans and bid for funding of their work with deaf learners. The v-shesh co-founder Mr Rajasekharan visited the University of Central Lancashire in October 2016 for discussions with the project's PI.

(b) Impact with policy makers. Meetings with the Indian Advisory Committee in India were particularly useful for determining future priorities. Participants recommended as next steps further policy-related engagement, in-service training for teachers on our approach to raise awareness, training more peer tutors and working with children in schools. Consequently, the Rehabilitation Council of India, the national accreditation body for courses and professionals in the disability sector, has expressed its interest in accrediting a one-year certificate training programme for deaf Indians to become formally qualified &amp;quot;Language and literacy trainers&amp;quot;; these deaf professionals could then work in the formal education sector, for example in schools for deaf children. The RCI's Member Secretary (i.e. the executive head) visited the University of Central Lancashire and Lancaster University in September 2016 to discuss this with members of the research team.

(c) Impact of training. Training and capacity building was a major objective of the research, particularly with respect to the deaf project staff. Several deaf project staff have gained allied skills enabling them to apply for international fellowships and scholarships to support the next phase of their university education. In June 2016, Ghanaian research assistant Nyarko won the prestigious Mandela Washington Fellowship for young African leaders. 

(d) International collaboration. Our literacy provision model is currently being adapted and extended to China through a British Council-funded exchange between UCLan and Zhongzhou University (home to a college with 600 deaf students). 

(e) Deaf-led research. We have used our model of deaf-led research to provide a 10-day training event in June-July 2016 in Vadodara, India, for 22 deaf instructors and graduates (funded by UCLan), aiming to build their skills in researching sign languages and deaf communities. A related series of Facebook posts with video summaries and comments has had 12,000 views so far. There is clearly a high level of interest in deaf-led research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9DD0AB0A-1219-47CD-8A48-361F07B81E56</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df0d0faad975.91682478</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The interrelated research questions revolved around how to implement a sustainable community-based and learner-centred English literacy programme for young deaf adult learners (research question RQ1), how to measure the effectiveness of peer tuition and a virtual learning environment (RQ2), and how to conceptualise the interrelated elements of the approach (RQ3).

With respect to RQ1, the research group implemented a successful intervention at five Indian field sites, and exemplified the importance of deaf-led research and capacity building in deaf communities through research. In publications, we explicated our ethnographic and learner-centred approach to this type of literacy education (Gillen, Panda, Papen &amp;amp; Zeshan, 2016), and our findings from focus group data collected in Ghana and Uganda (Ahereza, Nyarko, Fan, Gillen &amp;amp; Zeshan, 2016). We confirmed the validity and need for similar English literacy provision in these countries, while also pointing out important considerations with respect to possible barriers, such as technology coverage among deaf sign language users. Together with deaf learners in India, we co-constructed a bilingual online learning environment implemented on Moodle, called Sign Language to English by the Deaf (SLEND), which is now archived as a legacy site.

With respect to RQ2, for the Indian learners who participated in the educational intervention, we saw an improvement of their English literacy skills over time. We evidenced this via their results on tests that we adapted for deaf learners on the basis of the internationally recognised standard of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The results demonstrate that the intervention did result in a significant improvement in the test scores of 43 learners between the pre- and post-tests, and that there has been a sustained long-term effect on the participants which can be seen in the delayed post-test with 17 learners. We applied descriptive statistics to confirm that the results are statistically significant. Moreover, 44 participants rated their skills according to statements modified from the CEFR (level A1-A2). Again, statistical testing confirmed significant improvement.

The data most relevant to RQ3 come from qualitative data, most importantly the 46 learner interviews. They indicated a wholly positive response regarding usefulness of the real-life English approach and highlighted the use of Indian Sign Language as essential to improving English literacy. Learners valued opportunities to connect with other student groups, the diversity of activities on SLEND, and the multimodal learning resources. The peer tutors leading the learning activities with deaf learners in India were seen as supportive, raising learners' confidence. Respondents also commented on difficulties, most crucially, access issues to the SLEND and some concerns regarding varieties of Indian Sign Language. These findings are important for further adaptations to the approach in the future.

During the research, we also reflected especially on the consequences of conducting deaf-led research in the Global South. From the qualitative data, research team composition, training for deaf project staff, and agency in research at all levels emerged as crucial aspects of the systemic approach, and can be conceptualised under the heading of &amp;quot;agency subsidiarity&amp;quot; (Zeshan, in prep.).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our literacy provision model is being extended to China through a British Council-funded exchange between UCLan and Zhongzhou University (home to a college with 600 deaf students). We also submitted a follow-on-funding proposal for extending this research from English literacy to 'multiliteracies' (i.e. literacy, signing, metalinguistic and other skills), and from deaf adults in informal education to deaf children in formal education. This proposal builds on the pilot, with interventions in India, Ghana and Uganda, in collaboration with a new constellation of University partners who are well-placed to take the approach further in these countries in the future. Furthermore, we have used our model of deaf-led research to provide a 10-day training event in June-July 2016 in Vadodara, India, for 22 deaf instructors and graduates, aiming to build their skills in researching sign languages and deaf communities. The aim is to enable some of them continue similar research in other contexts. Through the international hubs coordinated by UCLan, we plan to adapt and distribute deaf-led research to other countries like Indonesia. Finally, we have had discussions with the Rehabilitation Council India, the national accreditation body for courses and professionals in the disability sector, about creating a one-year certificate training programme for deaf Indians to become formally qualified &amp;quot;Language and literacy trainers&amp;quot;.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F611A833-BBEF-4D4D-AC7F-71954CE40039</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0c9d015015.78216138</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.deafliteracy.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EA1F062-3EC7-4652-A581-EE9C970686B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supporting English literacy learning with young deaf people in India, Ghana and Uganda</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4942fe933cc76d9bbf57c4b7ad4513a6"><gtr:id>4942fe933cc76d9bbf57c4b7ad4513a6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gillen, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddbe59651de1.86985881</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE4B8ACB-494A-454B-BE28-BAA8B946A12C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Deaf literacy education -
