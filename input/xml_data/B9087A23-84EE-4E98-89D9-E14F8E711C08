Currently, there is no available technology which allows the detection of tainted carcasses on the production line to remove them from the food chain. The University of the West of England has developed prototype technology for the detection of boar taint to fill this gap in the international market. Initial feedback from end-users and market research indicated that the technology will be in high demand in the UK and on the international level. The main objectives of this project are to undertake further technological development and evaluation of our technology to demonstrate its commercial potential to end-users. This includes identifying the best route for bringing the technology to market and its mass-production; making contacts with licensees and improving the intellectual property position. The project is supported by JSR Genetics, and Biosciences Knowledge Transfer Partnership.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Computer Engineering Olot</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ENGINYERIA INFORM&amp;Agrave;TICA OLOT</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E0FC8A1-C676-47BC-B62E-B6665E90E17F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A collaborative grant application to BBSRC Super-follow-on fund is in preparation.

In particular, the project aimed to take our new technology for boar taint detection to national and international markets. The technology patent application has been filed. The reserach has identified industry requirements to the novel technology, incorporated them in the technology design and improved the technology performance. In particular, during the project we improved sensitivity of the technology, reduced the analysis time, and investigated potential interference effect of compounds naturally occurring in pig fat. Evaluation of the novel technology was conducted on pig adipose tissue samples provided by the industrial partner. A strong positive relationship was found between the measurements taken by traditional methods and by the new technology on the same samples. Extensive market research was undertaken and potential licencees for the technology have been identified. Manufacturers of the novel technology have been identified. IP position and IP provision have been improved. A patent application was filed in 2015 (published) and licensing agreements are under discussion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is currently no technology on international market which would allow rapid and cost-effective detection of boar taint at the point of test/on-line (e.g. in abattoirs). There is a great need in this technology at international and, especially, at European level. This is, in particular, related to the EU legislation on ban of piglets castration as a method of prevention of boar tain, by 2018. The new technology which was developed and evaluated in this project, will help to address the need of the UK and international pig industry in effective methods for detection of boar taint in entire pigs. This will allow to eliminate tainted carcasses from the food chain and thus, enhance consumers satisfaction and pork sales. This reserach will also benefit equipment manufacturing companies which can take licences for the technology manufacturing and/or distribution thus expanding their businesses and creating new jobs. The technology might be of benefit to pharmaceutical companies which produce vaccine for prevention of boar taint. The novel technology could be used for evaluation of the vaccination effectiveness. Results of this reserach can also be used for educational purposes in undegraduate and post-graduate teaching, influence future EU policies related to animal welfare and stimulate international networking. The technology will have environmental impact as it will facilitate the production of entire male pigs which is more environmentally friendly then production of castrated animals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>901E6AF2-62A3-4180-81EB-E14540ADFBDC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54627a32e7e3c3.02936051</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The new technology which is being patented, allows to detect skatole and androstenone at the point of test within minutes.

It will be of enormous benefit to researchers working on meat quality issues, boar taint, as well as to pharmaceutical research. The technology will increase the speed of analysis of skatole and androstenone from days to minutes, decrease the cost of analyses by at least 20-fold. This will accelerate research in food quality, molecular biology, biomedical and other areas as well as will have positive impact on pig producing industry via allowing the detection of boar taint on
