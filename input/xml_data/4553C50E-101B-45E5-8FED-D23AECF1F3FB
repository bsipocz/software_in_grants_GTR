The impact of this collaboration goes beyond UCL and Pfizer, with the methodological approach developed being used to inform the analysis strategies for similar datasets managed by Novartis and GSK, for example. HERMES membership, through Sonia's and her supporting PIs efforts has been extended and now includes a total of 11 large pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, AztraZeneca {AZ}, GSK, Eli Lily, Novartis, Amgen, Biogen, Boehringer, Merck, Servier, Vifor) who are participating with clinical trials data for heart failure. This secondment has been the catalyst enabling the establishment of this multi-company consortium.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a6dbc46be8.88609339-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contribution of important data-sets and know-how regarding analysis of genetic data.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The objectives of this partnership were: 1. Alignment of phenotypic and genetic data across HERMES (Heart failure Molecular Epidemiology for therapeutic targetS) cohorts to enable federated GWAS analyses across the consortium 2. Design and execution of GWAS analysis for heart failure phenotypes within each HERMES cohort 3. Design of analysis in EPHESUS trial dataset at Pfizer 4. Meta-analysis of study-specific results of heart failure phenotypes Sonia played a leading and integral role in the achievement of all objectives, by driving scientific and operational progress in the consortium, and strengthening the partnership between UCL and Pfizer, which contributes to the broad impact of the study so far.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MRC Technology (MRCT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRCT Centre for Therapeutics Discovery (CTD)</gtr:department><gtr:description>ITPTP secondments to MRCT and the European Lead Factory</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD77D481-229D-424F-B9D3-D3A196E5EB38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- The two secondees from cohort one were awarded their Royal Society of Chemistry Chartered chemist status following assessment on 1st Dec 2016.
