In line with the expanding remit of literary studies, my research assesses how authors function as cultural artefacts. Not only do authors create texts that carry cultural significance, they are themselves culturally constructed within different contexts and through different media: the text itself, the literary industry, national and international cultural politics, humanities scholarship and the various institutions it underpins. Authorship - 'being an author' - must therefore be understood not just as a literary practice, but as an ever-evolving process of construction undertaken by multiple players, in multiple contexts and to multiple ends. The precise nature of this process can only be grasped through an integrated approach that interprets textual phenomena historically, sociologically, culturally and linguistically. In pioneering such a research model, my project has the potential to change the way scholars across a range of Arts and Humanities disciplines approach the social significance of studying culture.

The focus of my research is in the first instance the German-speaking world. In particular, I examine the changing nature of the post-war public sphere, and trace the strategies developed by key authors to negotiate their integration in evolving media debates on image and identity over the last 60 years. Working with a range of source materials from literary texts to TV documentaries and government statistics on programmes of literary support, I interrogate concrete examples of how authors manipulate different text types, are received by different audiences, and are put to various wider social uses by a series of intermediaries. I argue that while authors such as G&amp;uuml;nter Grass, Elfriede Jelinek, or Daniel Kehlmann work within dominant, historically conditioned public understandings of their significance, they also use both their literature and other media texts to challenge these discourses and subvert them. Significant developmens in literary aesthetics can be traced across the period that both echo and interrupt wider sociological and technological developments. Equally, the different ways in which authors are constructed by others as symbolic personalities - e.g. as important cultural leaders or markedly compromised individuals - can illuminate the cultural moments into which they are placed. 

My interrogation of authors as important cultural phenomena is achieved by fusing together the various different methodological approaches underpinning literary and sociological lines of enquiry. In so doing, I develop a broadly applicable research model that lends itself to comparative investigation. 


Outputs:

1) My monograph, Writing Life: The Making of the Author in Germany's Media Age, will provide a first systematic, interdisciplinary analysis of the political, social and cultural circumstances of authorship in post-war Germany. 

2) A reader on authorship and fame will be published with a major UK/US publisher following a series of research events that will be carried out under the auspices of a research hub on 'World Authorship'. I am founding this as a long-term venture at Lancaster University to bring my understanding of authorship in the German context into dialogue with researchers from different disciplines (History, Cultural Studies, English, and Linguistics) and different linguistic and geographical contexts. The hub will consist of a number of research strands. This award allows me to pilot the first, on 'Authorship and Fame', which will consist of a series of 4 colloquia and workshops, and a significant website.

3) Further work resulting from the hub: 2 co-authored articles (PI and steering group members) on literary celebrity seen in different cultural contexts and as understood through a discourse historical approach will exemplify the hub's interdisciplinary work; 1 article on authorship and the internet by the RA will also straddle Literary and Media Studie</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Media debates about the public function of authors have been a recurrent feature of the post-war German cultural landscape and my monograph directly speaks to these. It has the potential to impact on the work of cultural journalists, agents, curators, prize juries and publishers within the well-developed network of public and private cultural institutions and media holdings in Germany and Austria. In order to develop this potential, I am liaising with two German colleagues, Dr G Nickel, who works in academe (U of Mainz) and for the national German public body, the German Literary Fund, and Dr D Stolz, who is a freelance literary editor and agent. We are proposing a series of public lectures / talks on the changing nature of authorship in contemporary Germany, to be held at a series of public locations in Germany throughout summer 2015. This will not only help me promote the scholarship underpinning my monograph to a wide German-language audience, but also has the potential to influence the German Literary Fund's policies and wider German media debate about the way authors are supported by various cultural programmes and funds. Other academic studies addressing some of these issues have already been widely referenced in ensuing media debate and taken up by industry insiders (e.g. Vandenrath 2006). We will draw on Dr Nickel's previous association with the Marbach Literary Archive to negotiate a first location with Dr M Lepper, the Director of International Research Scholarships and Summer Programmes at Marbach. Further contacts with public Literary Institutes will be made through the German Literary Fund. 

In the UK, my proposed interdisciplinary research hub has the potential to provide a valuable forum for creative practitioners: authors, publishers and cultural agencies, many of whom are increasingly hit by cuts in public funding. Due to its location within Lancaster University's Centre for Transcultural Writing and Research (http://www.transculturalwriting.com/; 1 million hits a year) the website will make participation in our events freely available to creative individuals working around the world. Their input into the strategic direction of the project will be actively encouraged through such features as an authors' blog, feedback on position papers, and an interactive Authors' Resources facility for individuals to share materials relevant to the creative process. The high visibility and stability of the CTWR website provides a valuable 'shop window' for creative practitioners to profile their work and engage in collaborative initiatives that help them negotiate the challenges of authorship in the current economic climate. In line with the non-Anglophone element of my project, we will work particularly with cultural agencies specialising in translation and foreign-language promotion in the UK. The fact that this creative exchange unfolds alongside academic research undertaken by scholars from a diverse range of disciplines further enhances the exposure of these practitioners to important elements of the global literary field. Their work will be highlighted in research, and there is the further possibility that it will be placed on curricula as an object of study.

The impact model followed is that of the highly successful &amp;pound;380 000 AHRC-funded Moving Manchester project and website (2006-10), as well as earlier work on the 'Crossing Borders' and 'Radiophonics' projects, completed under the auspices of the British Council and now also housed on the CTWR website. All three projects created sites that helped authors, publishers and cultural agencies showcase their work and share information about the creative process. Writers from the 'Moving Manchester' project have performed and lectured to Lancaster undergraduates; the work of African writers in the online 'Crossing Borders Magazine' is available to and has been used by teachers internationally. My hub will adopt similar strategies of engagement and dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172607</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public round table on Shakespeare in Europe</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B7D71F3-5F26-4E7C-9097-C1A2FCAF377A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An expert panel on 'radical translation', presenting and discussing creative translation of Shakespeare into 20th-C German and then back into English- with Ulrike Draesner, Tom Cheeseman, and Benedict Schofield.

The participants came from a wide mix of backgrounds - interested members of the public, postgraduate creative writing students, academics working in Modern Languages, English, Linguistics, Cultural Studies, and invited industry representatives: a translator, a publisher, a newspaper reviewer, a published author (hence difficult to answer 'primary audience' question above). The prime result of the activity was that all participants reflected on their assumptions and gained immediate feedback from people working in related areas of activity, but whom they do not ordinarily get a chance to meet. All attendees expressed a strong desire to be involved in the future work of our research hub, 'Authors and the World'.

Hard to quantify at this stage. Short videos from all industry speakers have been posted to our website, and a photobook of the event published online. We expect these to have a useful role in disseminating our activities. They may lead to more concrete requests for engagement at a later date.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54412b5e866099.92343757</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.authorsandtheworld.com/?p=953</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Translation workshop (Upcycling Shakespeare with Ulrike Draesner)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26FC7A76-2178-4DBE-A7D0-07C282815468</gtr:id><gtr:impact>German author and 'radical' Shakespeare translator Ulrike Draesner shared her practice with final year undergraduate students of translation.

Nevertheless, we have been consciously developing an iterative model of 'impact through co-design' that has already, on a small scale, borne fruit for our non-academic partners and set up a promising impact pathway. 

In the portfolio of events run by the 'Authors and the World' research hub since 2014, we have collaborated with professionals (writers, publishers, editors, translators, agents, newspaper reviewers) from the creative sector in the UK, Europe, India, and Latin America. These professionals reported appreciating the space that being involved in academic research has provided for them to reflect on the circumstances of their work in the wider literary industry. 

We continue to cultivate on-going links with all of these professionals, through guest blog contributions to our website, residencies at Lancaster University (German writers Ulrike Almut Sandig 2014-15 and Ulrike Draesner 2015-16; UK translator of French and Hispanic fiction, Frank Wynne 2016), co-hosted public events off campus, and select contributions to two interdisciplinary publication projects currently in processing (a special issue of a journal on literary celebrity, and a handbook on authorship). 

The kind of impact that we are pursuing through such intertwining of academic research in literary studies and the broader professional contexts of literature has lent the project a distinct element of stakeholder 'co-design'. We expect to build on this in the coming years, as the 'Authors and the World' research hub expands its links with the creative sector in order to enable new thinking and share best practice within the broad area of public engagement with literature. 

Specifically, negotiations are currently underway to optimise the methodological expertise gleaned from the AHRC-funded stage of the 'Authors and the World' project by collaborating with a major Arts Council-funded centre for literature from mid-2016 onwards. We believe this is an iterative model of impact that will yield important results for both academe and the creative sector. We hope to be able to begin reporting in more tangible terms in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>18C2F5C4-8D2E-4A37-91BD-424D2580E2F7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54413bd80bcb80.00462181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant has advanced knowledge on literary authorship in three distinct areas:

1. My monograph (manuscript currently in final stages of preparation) has interrogated the specifically German, post-war contexts of authorship. It casts its net widely to include analysis of publishing houses, emergent media networks, friendship groupings and professional literary organizations across West Germany, East Germany and Austria alongside close-readings of key self-reflexive literary texts over the past sixty years. In so doing, it conceptualizes the central role played by geographical place, human agency and physical bodies in sustaining dominant gender-biased and ethnically troubled models of literary achievement. While these models have been subject to modification and diversification as Germany has opened out to the international market and global patterns of migration, significant, historically conditioned blind spots remain that continue to affect contemporary practices in the literary industry.

2. The research hub 'Authors &amp;amp; the World' has pioneered a multi-disciplinary, multi-language approach to the topic of 'literary celebrity'. This has significantly advanced our understanding of: the deep historical roots of literary celebrity throughout the Western world, the links across Western cultures between literary celebrity and discourses around nation-building, the gendered nature of the spaces in which literary celebrity is expressed, the reach of literary celebrity across multiple genres and media, and the economic and cultural specificity of literary celebrity to individual literary markets. These findings have been captured in a special issue of the journal Celebrity Studies, entitled 'Literary Celebrity', ed. R Braun &amp;amp; E Spiers, to be be published in autumn 2016.

3. Building on our findings on literary celebrity, the 'Authors &amp;amp; the World' hub has initiated a further research strand into 'world authorship'. This strand has begun to conceptualize how, while individual manifestations of literary celebrity remain tied to national contexts, images of culturally-significant authorship nevertheless circulate as part of a global flow of literature. We contend that this needs to be understood as a collective process whereby literary value is repeatedly re-mediated by a series of locally grounded actors who both draw upon and relativize the original author. This research is ongoing, but a first exploration of our ideas with reference to the global reach of German-language writing can be accessed in the special issue of the journal Seminar, entitled 'World Authorship', ed. R. Braun &amp;amp; A. Piper, 51:2 (2015).

Taken together, the multi-disciplinary research strands pursued on this project have allowed us to conclude the following. Modern-day authorship is the outward facing embodiment of literary agency, and it is defined by four foundational principles: it is collaborative, it has a human and a non-human element, it relies on the illusion of individuality and determinacy, and it occurs across a wide range of media.

These preliminary findings are informing a new programme of research for the 'Authors and the World' hub with effect from 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My monograph encourages a re-reading of German literary history that resists the idea of a fundamental caesura in the role of the author around 1989/90 and provides a systematic set of conceptual models that set out authors' broader social significance in ways that go beyond accounting for straightforward political and economic phenomena. There is much research being done into very contemporary individual manifestations of authorship / modes of literary self-presentation in German-speaking Europe by scholars in German Studies, Theatre Studies, History of the Book and Comparative Literature. My monograph should provide an important backbone and backstory to these analyses.

Celebrity Studies is also a thriving area of research, but there are few publications dealing with the specific phenomenon of literary celebrity across multiple disciplines and contexts. We therefore expect the findings that have informed our special issue of Celebrity Studies to be of interest to a broad range of cognate disciplines. 

World Authorship is a particularly emergent area of enquiry specifically associated with the work of the 'Authors and the World' hub, and we expect this to attract considerable interest from scholars of World Literature and cognate areas across literary and language studies.

Further work remains to be done on the following areas of both literary celebrity and world authorship, each of which have been staked out in individual contributions to our various publications, and some of which are being actively pursued on other international projects: the authoritative academic voice / the academy and celebrity / digital humanities' approaches to tracking literary celebrity and world authorship / the gendered aspects of processes and spaces underpinning celebrity and world authorship.

We expect the key academic users of our research to be based in Comparative Literature, Cultural Studies, English &amp;amp; Creative Writing, Film &amp;amp; Theatre Studies, Fine Art, Linguistics, Modern Languages, Translation Studies.
