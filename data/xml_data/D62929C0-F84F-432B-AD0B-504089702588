The project addresses concerns about the absence of relevant, timely and high-quality data on the financial position and resources of charities. There is a need for longer term and large-scale investment on a UK-wide basis (the focus here is on England and Wales); this project builds on a long history of existing work in this area by TSRC and NCVO with the intention of increasing the sector's engagement with, and use of, evidence.

In the words of Lester Salamon, the leading international scholar of the third sector, &amp;quot;valid and reliable statistics will enhance the visibility and credibility of voluntary organisations, contribute to improved transparency and accountability of the sector and of government, and provide empirical context for decision making and policy development&amp;quot;. The Office for National Statistics, the Office for Civil Society, and the academic community in this field are all supportive of these efforts.

We will carry out three strands of activity:

1. Data resource construction 
We will capture data for a representative sample of c.10,000 charities in England and Wales. By the end of the funding period we will be able to track charities over a ten-year period. This will be a unique and powerful data resource for insight. The sample is representative of the population of English and Welsh charities and provides reasonably robust estimates of the resources of all charities. We capture information from the notes to charities accounts, describing where they get their income from (e.g. giving the names of their funders such as particular local authorities, government departments or charitable foundations). We then classify this information so that we can clearly identify particular funding streams - especially public sector funders - so that we can also differentiate between grants and contracts.

2. Capacity-building
We will raise awareness of this data amongst charities, policy makers and funders and of its value for their work and decision-making. We will construct numerous relevant indicators of financial health/vulnerability in the voluntary sector.

We will produce learning resources and run events to build capacity in using the tools and data resources we develop. Organisations will be free to use our data in several ways: profiling charities in their geographical area; selecting entities with whom partnership working might be developed; considering the financial vulnerability of organisations; looking at indicators of distribution/growth of the charity population, and also at risk-based indicators such as exposure to particular funding streams.

3. Knowledge exchange
We will implement an engagement and communication strategy, producing accessible outputs and targeted communications, engaging strategically significant organisations to raise awareness, and publicising our activities through social media and the Internet; we will maximise impact upon large numbers of charities, funders, and policy-makers (e.g. NCVO has 11,000+ members).

Key features 

Innovation and originality: the project will provide the basis of a data infrastructure on the characteristics, distribution and resources of charities in England and Wales, and the dynamics thereof, including changes over time.

Strategic priorities and value: the project contributes to the improvement of the social science data infrastructure. It will inform public debate and policy-making about the funding base for charities and inform and improve strategic decision-making.

Value added: the UK social science infrastructure currently lacks an authoritative evidence base on charities, which this project will provide. The project also adds value to the work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on assessing the contribution of the non-profit sector to the national accounts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our programme will generate datasets which will be of significant value to a range of national and international, interdisciplinary, academic audiences interested in substantive and theoretical understanding of the third sector, and in particular the flows of resources to, and the funding base of, third sector organisations.

This work will also be of central value to those working within the third sector. Our partnership is uniquely situated at the heart of the sector, allowing us to maximise awareness of, and engagement with, the evidence we will generate, and maximise the impact on voluntary organisations, policy-makers and researchers. Knowledge exchange activity will be led by NCVO, taking advantage of their extensive networks including c.11,000+ members, websites (approximately two million unique visitors each year across all of our websites), twitter (38,000 followers), blogs and newsletters. Equally, TSRC is embedded within academia, providing extensive links to researchers working on the third sector.

Building upon our previous five years of research, we will extend existing data resources on registered charities in England and Wales, so that by the end of the funding period we will have captured and classified some ten years of data on our sample of 10,000 charities. This will provide an unrivalled resource for the analysis of trends in the funding base of charities. It will be of value to researchers in a range of disciplines (Social Policy, Politics, Business and Management, Geography, Economics) who require authoritative evidence on the numbers and characteristics of third sector organisations as well as policy-makers and people working in the sector.

The data will be of considerable value to non-academic users, providing them with a new depth of analysis and insight. Organisations themselves will have a much clearer picture of which organisations, and where, are gaining or losing from changing funding streams and how this is changing over time. Claims in this sphere lack a strong evidence base; this project will provide it. Funders will have a clearer picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the local charitable sector, because we will be constructing datasets that are robust at the regional level, something that will enhance strategic decisions. We will construct indicators of the finances of the third sector, and the financial health of individual organisations, which will be of value to funders and individual organisations alike.

Government departments, local authorities, and the wider public policy community share an interest in reliable statistics on the voluntary sector. This project will provide robust evidence on a key element of that sector - registered charities in England and Wales. This will provide a sound platform for evidence-based debate and policy-making.

We will run a series of interactive and practical events, workshops and training sessions targeted at third sector organisations, policy-makers and funders to raise awareness of these datasets, build their capacity to engage with and use them in their work, and promote their wider use; the material from these events will subsequently be made available online to maximise engagement with its content.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Views of NCVO Almanac website - this publication is based on data jointly constructed by NCVO and TSRC throuh this project.
