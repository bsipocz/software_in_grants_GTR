Instruments do not have to implement traditional music gestures. In fact, by incorporating expressive gestures from other domains, they can enable large numbers of potential creators/performers to make music; for example, videogame players who may not have formal musical training but already possess sophisticated skills in the use of digital game controllers. Therefore, development of appropriate digital music devices can unleash latent creative potential regardless of musical background.\n\nThis project aims to enable music performance by using natural hand actions (e.g. throwing objects, sowing seeds, etc.) - furthering the possibilities afforded by game controllers. It will implement a self contained 'Manual Actions Expressive System' (MAES) consisting of a digital glove controlled by specialised software for the creation of musical gestures. While these gestures result from tracking and analysing hand position, rotation and finger bend, the technology will allow performers to concentrate on natural actions from daily use of the hands (e.g. the physical movement associated with 'throwing' and 'sowing'). For this reason, MAES will not require formal musical training, producing sophisticated sound that is a believable result of the performer's natural actions and providing intimate control of the sound. Thus, it will allow individuals who would not have had the opportunity otherwise, to engage actively in music making. At the same time, it will enable performers to achieve virtuosity by providing gestures that can be adapted to individual requirements: gestures will be developed, tested, validated and demonstrated through the creation of a musical work for live performance.\n\nResearch and development has been carried out using hand tracking technology with various degrees of success, but none of this has so far yielded a sufficient repertoire of intuitive gestures that produce sophisticated musical materials. Thus, this project is central to current concerns in gesture and expressivity; being crucial in the development of effective digital interfaces, the creation of new media repertoires and consolidation of new artistic forms.\n\nMAES will complete the first stage of an overarching strategy for the realisation of 'Structured interactive immersive Musical experiences' (SiiMe), in which users advance at their own pace in a virtual environment stimulating all the senses (hearing, sight, smell, etc.) and choose their own trajectory through a musical work, but have to act within its interactive rules and constraints towards a final goal - the realisation of the music. This first stage will identify roadmaps for further research and development: for instance, performance instructions may be subsequently implemented in the form of a videogame, acting as a score with game motivations such as rewards for accurate performances, etc. \n\nMAES will create cultural benefits by: \n\n- Unleashing creative potential regardless of musical background.\n- Allowing development of creative skills towards virtuosity.\n- Allowing more individuals to embrace active forms of creative engagement (instead of passive listening/viewing).\n- Enabling a wide spectrum of aesthetic conceptions and approaches, thus challenging the 'popular'/'art' schism.\n- Developing current and new art forms.\n\nUltimately, SiiMe will also create mid-long term industrial, social, scientific and educational benefits:\n\n- Developing the entertainment industries (e.g. music, games, film). \n- Enabling new forms of communal social activity in both real and virtual spaces.\n- Providing researchers in other fields with content and technologies for simulation environments for other disciplines, vocational training and new learning environments (e.g. 'participation' in historical events).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is the first stage of a long term research strategy which will produce pivotal cultural and social shifts, creating significant benefits in these areas and providing substantial mid-long term industrial, social, scientific and educational benefits.\n\nA significant part of this impact concerns two issues. Firstly, it will contribute to the shift, heralded by recent technological development, from the relative isolation of private listening/viewing of readymade artefacts, to active forms of engagement; fostering creative social interaction that enhances quality of life and social wellbeing. Its effects will emulate those incipient in later generations of computer games, in which new paradigms encouraging communal activity at home[1] or in virtual venues[2] (often accessed from home), exemplify a process whereby human beings meet together in order to enjoy a common activity. Technology at the centre of this research will make this possible for music performance in a modern incarnation of the parlour; be it at home or as a 'cyber-soiree'. In this context videogames offer an ideal platform for the realisation of music in the 'new parlour'. Therefore, the current proposal will enable further developments (both public and commercial, see 'Pathways to Impact'), that will benefit the increasingly large numbers of game players and cyber socialites. \n\nSecondly, it will have a significant cultural impact by enhancing creative output and contributing to the post-modern blurring of 'popular'/'art' boundaries, challenging the 'traditional' schism: this project will benefit creators and performers in the modern parlour, who embrace music resulting from a wide spectrum of aesthetic conceptions and approaches. Furthermore, since current technology is used to reduce virtuosity requirements (subsuming complexity while allowing control through simple actions) and performance is based on paradigms that are idiomatic to a wide range of contemporary potential performers, music-making becomes accessible to a whole videogame generation that prefers interactivity and, although lacking formal musical training, already possesses appropriate strategic and motoric performance skills[3]. It is therefore capable of unleashing latent creative potential regardless of musical background, enabling development of creative skills towards virtuosity.\n\nAs the degree of sophistication of sonic output and its organisation is subsumed within the technology, this will generate demand for further sophistication in order to achieve more refined musical expression and so on[4], in a feedback cycle that has the potential to develop new artistic expression; eroding further the 'popular'/'art' differentiation until this is made irrelevant.\n\nThe outputs are prototypes for further development in partnership with the commercial sector. Therefore, this project will provide innovative content and support for the creative and cultural industries, and media (e.g. music, games, film); fostering UK and global economic performance.\n\nFurther long term developments will benefit education through new generations of virtual learning environments (e.g. 'participation' in historical events, 'interaction' with physics' laws), as well as therapeutic practice for the general public through environments for treatment of disabilities, learning disorders, rehabilitation, etc.\n\n---\n[1] E.g.: Nintendo Wii Sports (2006) games. \n[2] E.g.: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n[3] This pool of potential performers is large beyond precedent, as evidenced by videogames sales figures.Tthe BBC (2008) reported that 'spending on games will rise by 42% to &amp;pound;4.64bn in 2008, with sales on music and video at &amp;pound;4.46bn'.\n[4] This happens with graphics' sophistication, where demand for fidelity independent of content (i.e. a scene may not be possible but i</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71432</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performance at Keele University, 5/3/14

Ruraq Maki, which means 'handmade' in the Quechua language spoken in the central Andes of South America, is a composition performed by means of natural hand actions (e.g. hitting virtual objects, shaking them, etc.). This is enabled by means of a self-contained 'Manual Actions Expressive System' (MAES) consisting of a digital glove controlled by specialised software for the creation of musical gestures. While these gestures result from tracking and analysing hand motion and finger bend, the technology allows performers to concentrate on natural actions from our daily use of the hands (e.g. the physical movement associated with hitting, shaking, dragging, etc.). Therefore, the performer generates and 'manipulates' sounds, shaping the latter, engaging with virtual sound sources and interacting with MAES in a manner similar to that of videogame play, in which the technology is driven by the user according to rules that vary depending on the current state of the 'game'; i.e. the musical work. Future plans for MAES include the realisation of a 'videogame score' which will enable individuals who do not have formal musical training to perform works such as Ruraq Maki, engaging actively in music making. At the same time, it will still allow performers to achieve virtuosity by providing gestures that can be adapted to individual requirements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EEA54C68-EC2A-4212-9E9C-D6A88503602D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>622 views on 23/10/2014</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5448c84df21a60.68573823</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Ruraq Maki (Handmade) - available http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb2FMNiL0-4</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb2FMNiL0-4</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performance at Sound Junction 2014, Drama Studio, University of Sheffield, UK, 4/4/14

MAES consists of a digital glove controlled by specialised software for the creation of musical gestures. While these gestures result from tracking and analysing hand motion and finger bend, the technology allows performers to concentrate on natural actions from our daily use of the hands (e.g. the physical movement associated with hitting, shaking, etc.). Therefore, performers are able to generate and 'manipulate' sounds, shaping the latter, engaging with virtual sound sources and interacting with MAES in a manner similar to that of videogame play, in which the technology is driven by the user according to rules that vary depending on the current state of the 'game'; i.e. the musical work. Gestures are fully programmable and result from tracking and analysing hand motion and finger bend, potentially allowing performers to concentrate on natural actions from our daily use of the hands (e.g. the physical movement associated with hitting and shaking). 



The conceptual approach in MAES focused on mapping strategies and audio content: rather than investing time and effort on the creation of new devices this research emphasises the adaptation of existing technology for creative compositional use in gesture design, sound design and the causal match of gesture with sound. Therefore, in addition to the development of the software tools required for adaptation, most of the work has gravitated around the design and implementation of a sufficiently versatile mapping strategy underpinned by a corresponding synthesis and processing audio engine, and a viable compositional approach which is embodied and demonstrated in 'Ruraq Maki' (Handmade), the resulting musical work: the mapping of gestures is as important as the corresponding selection of audio materials and sound processes. In other words, the main concern shifts from technological development to actual content, ultimately embodied in the musical output.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Using natural hand actions enables music-making that becomes accessible to performers that, although lacking formal musical training, already possess appropriate strategic and motoric performance skills, since 1) current technology is used to reduce virtuosity requirements, subsuming complexity while allowing user control through simpler actions, 2) performance is based on paradigms that are idiomatic to a wide range of contemporary potential performers and 3) unlike traditional musical instruments, it does not require learning conventions specific to a particular device that are often outside common bodily experience (e.g. it is necessary to learn how to use a bow to produce sound on a violin, to develop an embouchure to play a wind instrument, etc.). At the same time, it allows performers to achieve virtuosity by providing gestures that can be adapted to individual requirements. 



Therefore, MAES can widen music participation in non-academic contexts by providing an affordable system that:



? Unleashes creative potential latent in everyone, regardless of musical background.



? Allows development of creative skills towards virtuosity.



? Allows significantly more individuals to embrace active forms of creative engagement (instead of passive listening/viewing).

 

? Enables artistic diversity thanks to the configurability of gestures and associated audio; allowing a wide spectrum of aesthetic conceptions and approaches and challenging the 'popular'/'art' schism.



MAES is the first complete stage of a longer term research strategy for the realisation of structured interactive immersive multimedia experiences (SiiMe), in which participants advance at their own pace, interacting with the environment and other in situ or remote participants, immersed in a multi-modal augmented reality that involves all our senses, choosing individual trajectories through a multimedia artistic work but having to act within its rules and constraints towards a final goal - the realisation of the artwork itself. In the mid-long term SiiMe has the potential to:



? Provide content and technologies for simulation environments in other disciplines, vocational training and new learning environments (e.g. 'participation' in historical events).



? Develop the entertainment industries (e.g. music, games, film's future interactive, immersive transformation). 



? Enable new forms of communal social activity through creativity in both real and virtual spaces via networking and global communication propitiates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD50F747-CACC-45B1-A67F-EA8FE2D278EE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9293384001.863546775bb8a2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://vimeo.com/55093629</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Software for music performance using natural hand actions, exploiting the potential of hand gestures to generate, shape and manipulate sounds as if these were physical entities within a larger structured musical environment.
