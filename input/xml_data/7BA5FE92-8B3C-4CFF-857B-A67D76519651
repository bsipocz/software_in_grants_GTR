(IP-LFI)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L000512/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Learning From Incidents (LFI) is a seminar series&amp;nbsp;advancing theory, methodology, practice and policy in learning from incidents.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Effective learning from incidents is critical for people working in hazardous environments,&amp;nbsp;to ensure they are safe at work and to protect the environment from catastrophic accidents. First of its kind in the world, the&amp;nbsp;series brings together practitioners and policymakers with researchers from a range of disciplines including Adult and&amp;nbsp;Organisational Learning, Sociology, Industrial Psychology, Human Factors Engineering and Ethnomethodology to provide new&amp;nbsp;theories, methodologies and organisational change methods that can be applied by organisations to improve learning from safety incidents across a range of industries.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Running for two years, the series comprises six interdisciplinary seminars,&amp;nbsp;including presentations from researchers, practitioners and policymakers, allowing sufficient time for debate and discussion and stimulating co-production of knowledge. The series includes participants from the UK, Finland, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Norway, among other countries. Outputs from the seminar series include an interdisciplinary research agenda in learning from incidents&amp;nbsp;and an edited volume, synthesising scientific contributions from research and relevant case studies from industry.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

While LFI has its roots in highly hazardous work contexts (i.e. the energy sector), it has wide application across a broader range of private and public sectors (for example manufacturing, construction, healthcare, finance). The principal beneficiaries of Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Learning from Incidents are employees, frontline and senior managers and trade union representatives, in organisations across these sectors. These people experience direct impact -injury, loss of life, as well as costly disturbances in the production processes - from industrial incidents, therefore effective learning from and prevention of incidents is of vital importance to them. The series is also of direct benefit to relevant regulatory bodies, policy makers and third-sector representatives associated with health and safety. Organisations include the Health and Safety Executive, the British Safety Council, the UK regional Environmental Agencies (EPA, SEPA, etc), Step Change in Safety, the Safety and Reliability Society, the European Process Safety Centre, TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research), Oil and Gas UK, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), National Air Traffic Services (NATS), the National Coastguard Agency, Southwest Trains and Lloyds Register (Maritime). Industrial incidents sometimes bring about environmental degradation and loss of livelihood for communities and society at large. Therefore, another beneficiary is society as a whole.

How will they benefit from this research?

We have secured participation of a significant number of representatives of these potential beneficiaries (amounting to a quarter of the total number of the series participants), including a range of industries, government, and professional and third-sector bodies. They have committed to actively participating in the series, either as speakers or as contributors who will contribute to specific knowledge co-production activities we have designed into the seminars. Short- and medium-term impact arises from their exposure to innovative, interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological insights from a range of disciplines they do not yet collaborate with could trigger insights for novel applications within their own organisation. The concepts and thinking they help evolve through the seminars will stimulate fresh ideas, which these beneficiaries are committed to taking back to and implementing within their organisations, and potentially integrating these into their operational plans and activities. Co-production of series outputs by industry and policy stakeholders alongside researchers extends shared ownership, improving the likelihood of adoption and application of research in real-world settings. Long-term impact from this seminar series is expected to include enhancements in the health and well-being of employees; fostering economic performance of the United Kingdom, through improved individual, group and organisational learning from incidents, and increased effectiveness of LFI policy, through improved conceptualisation and research-based evidence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28961</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bamberg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>EU Horizon 2020 proposal consortium BOLSTER (2016-2017 Mobility for Growth H2020-MG-2016-2017)</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D95C309-D9E8-48ED-84DA-85851095D162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Horizon 2020 project proposal SEP-210412777.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c925e96d16b7.22339210-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Professor Lasse Gerrits leads the project consortium, contributing expertise in complexity and the governance of complex systems as well as big data analysis, in particular transport systems.

The presentations from law, construction and other sectors were followed by a lively debate and discussion between scholars, practitioners and PhD students and postdocs. Participants reported (through structured evaluation) development of insights into LFI issues and challenges from different organisations and sectors; improved networks; formation of new ideas that they intended to implement in their workplace; intention to disseminate knowledge obtained at the seminar within their own organisation; improve their training materials on the basis of the knowledge and insight gained at the seminar; intention to rethink their own organisational practice of LFI; intention to use knowledge obtained at the seminar in order to review the relevant procedures in their organisation (with their senior management) and educate their staff in the procedures to be implemented.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5d257a16b85.22798528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lfiseminars.ning.com/lfipracticeandpolicy</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 6 - Research and development agenda for learning from incidents</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68F57676-5BC2-47BC-B16E-FE18DC1585D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the final seminar in the series, attended by the core seminar members. The core members included (senior) academics and postgraduate researchers from a range of UK universities; industry partners from Anglo American (mining) and Phillips 66 (oil and gas); professional bodies (Energy Institute); and R&amp;amp;D organisations internationally (the Dutch TNO). The seminar focused on presentation and round table discussion of a research and development agenda for learning from incidents that brought together the contributions, concepts, ideas and questions prioritised through seminars 1-5. The seminar also focused on the discussion of the impact of the seminar series and the next steps including future publications, grants and other forms of collaboration. A procedure for systematic gathering of current and future impact was discussed and agreed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c93190575e12.04894483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lfiseminars.ning.com/lfiagenda</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 1, Learning from Incidents: Mapping the problem space (Glasgow, UK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF2FCA46-8B73-48D3-A671-F3C877EF9515</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The inaugural seminar in this seminar series was attended by 41 participants from the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. 30% of the seminar participants were (senior) representatives and practitioners from:

- government bodies (Health and Safety Executive)
- professional bodies (Energy Institute), and
- third sector organisations (British Safety Council)

Presentations included talks from both scholars and practitioners. These were followed by a structured knowledge co-production activities, in which ideas from the presentations were discussed and debated in interdisciplinary and intersectoral groups. Participants from academia and user communities jointly formulated and prioritised key questions for future research and development in learning from incidents. Two working papers were produced as a result of this event (see publications section). Participants reported increased understanding of multidisciplinary and intersectoral perspectives; improvement of their own practice; exposure to new literature that was unfamiliar to them; establishment of new networks; intention to implement ideas discussed in their own organisations; and appreciation of opportunity to engage with academia (particularly SMEs commented on this).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5afa18ae1a7.93575835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lfiseminars.ning.com/mappinglfi</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 5, Linking research and practice in Learning from Incidents (London, UK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0866BD74-5120-44B1-979E-932493EFD2A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>27 participants attended this event, of which 48% were research users.

The majority, 63%, of the seminar participants were users and beneficiaries of research, including:
- representative of several types of industries such as oil and gas, healthcare, transport and types of organisations including multinationals and SMEs (eg Shell, Centrica, Baker Hughes, Bristow, NHS, Dana Petroleum, AMEC, Kellstone, doctors.org.uk, Petrotechnics)
- government bodies (Norwegian Petroleum Authority)
- professional bodies (Energy Institute), and
- third sector organisations (British Safety Council)

Presentations included talks from both scholars and practitioners. These were followed by a structured knowledge co-production activity, in which participants jointly developed a conceptual model of Learning from Incidents and outlined key disciplinary and theoretical concepts and approaches from across social sciences, engineering and life sciences that could be brought to bear on the nascent filed of learning from incidents. These included input from practitioners.

Participants reported increased understanding of theoretical perspectives previously unfamiliar to them; exposure to new literature and the academic perspective on learning from incidents; enhanced opportunity to share knowledge; stimulation to think about LFI in new ways.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5b6851128f4.57486815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lfiseminars.ning.com/theorisinglfi</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>65000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Postgraduate research funding, Glasgow Caledonian internal</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7A7E3270-86B2-4236-9C11-1A7B25F8216B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c92a9e27cff6.36783616</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our stated objectives with regards to impact were as follows:

*Short-term impact: Building an understanding of LFI as a critical area of health and safety among practitioners and policy-makers
*Medium-term impact: Applying enhanced approaches to LFI in the companies participating in the seminar series.
*Long-term impact: Establishing LFI as a research area impacting practice and policy, in particular enhancing the health and quality of life of employees and fostering economic performance of the United Kingdom, through improved individual, group and organisational learning from safety incidents.

The short-term objective has been achieved. The seminars have succeeded in engaging a large number of research users and beneficiaries who reported improved understanding, awareness and insight into. This is evidenced in detail in 'Engagement activities' and 'Key results' sections. 

The medium-term objective has also been achieved. Knowledge and ideas generated through the seminar series have been applied by participants in their organisations. In preparation of this impact report, I asked participants to identify how the seminar outputs have been used. Key examples quoted by the participants are listed below:

1) Ideas from the seminar series have been applied at Costain Group: &amp;quot;What I have taken away is a need to revisit our corporate approach to incident investigation to draw out points of learning but also how these can be disseminated to the organisation. We are currently revising our approach to draw out better lessons from incidents/events while, at the same time, working on more varied approaches to passing on those lessons - our organisation has staff from lower-skilled operatives to highly technical engineering staff and a single or few approaches are clearly not reaching everyone across this spectrum.&amp;quot; Richard Roff, Group Process Safety Manager

2) Seminar generated industry-research collaboration for a UK company: &amp;quot;They were a great series of events to attend, and much better for me than most of the paid events I attend!
One major outcome for my organisation, CIRAS, is now using the skills of one of your presenters, Professor Lasse Gerrits, to do some 'big data' analysis on our database. We invited him to give a talk at a 'food for thought' session (similar to the presentation he gave at the learning from incidents seminar), and we discussed our own organisational requirements after that, leading to the current work. So I'm very positive about the seminars. It was a great way for professionals to exchange ideas and information in the best academic tradition - publically, and for free, as a delegate.&amp;quot; Chris Langer, Scheme Intelligence Manager

3) Ideas from seminars implemented at HU Tech: &amp;quot;Seeing how LFI was practiced in other sectors [was helpful]. Normally I would get most of my learning from within my own sectors (oil &amp;amp; gas / rail) and would not get much exposure to people doing the same work in other sectors. I found the healthcare and construction examples very informative and I have taken some of the approaches forward in the advice I now give to clients.&amp;quot; Rob Miles

We expect that it will take some time for long-term impacts - establishing LFI as a research field and measurably increasing effectiveness of LFI practice and policy - to materialise. We have agreed a procedure and have an instrument in place to systematically and regularly collect data on future impact from this work to 2021.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>94CD1C07-035A-4C4A-84B9-AFB323F670AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54410fbb728dc4.25718909</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Education,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We organised and successfully completed all 6 seminars in this seminar series. Seminars included a wide range of speakers and participants nationally and internationally from a variety of disciplines across Social Sciences, Life Sciences and Engineering and a sectors, including academia, 3rd sector organisations (British Safety Institute, professional bodies (Energy Institute), government (HSE), and the industry (BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Dana Petroleum to name a few). For more details see 'Engagement Activities' section.

The seminars attracted over 150 participants, including 27 keynote speakers - academics, practitioners and policymakers - from a wide range of organisations and sectors from 7 countries across Europe and the US and 10 different disciplines/fields.

Each seminar included knowledge co-production activities, through which the following key outputs were produced jointly by scholars, postgraduate students, practitioners and policymakers:

1) An initial list of key questions/challenges for research and development in Learning from Incidents
2) A conceptual model of Learning From Incidents (LFI) representing multiple perspectives within which relevant interdisciplinary theories could be positioned. 
3) An inventory of extant and potential methodologies that could be used to research LFI
4) A set of 6 focus areas and challenges for future research in learning from incidents. 

6 working papers were produced describing each of these results in detail (see Publications section).

A major programmatic paper outlining a research and development agenda for LFI was produced on the basis of the seminars. The paper has been accepted for publication in Safety Science journal.

A special issue of Safety Science journal on Learning from Incidents is currently under production. The special issue is co-edited by the PI (Margaryan) and the Co-investigators (Stanton and Littlejohn) - see Awards and Recognition section for further details. 

The seminars raised awareness of the importance of learning from incidents in the industry and exposed the participants to a wide range of disciplinary and sectoral research, practices and policies in learning from incidents. For more details see 'Engagement Activities' section.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We were able to attract a significant level of participation from research users (amounting on average to a third of the total number of the series participants), including a range of industries, government, and professional and third-sector bodies. In the short- and medium-term, these potential beneficiaries' exposure to innovative, interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological insights from a range of disciplines they had not hitherto collaborated with might trigger insights for novel applications within their own organisation. Participants reported that the concepts and thinking they helped evolve through the seminars stimulated fresh ideas, which these beneficiaries were committed to taking back to and implementing within their organisations, and potentially integrating these into their operational plans and activities. Co-production of series outputs by industry and policy stakeholders alongside researchers extends shared ownership, improving the likelihood of adoption and application of research in real-world settings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>01E41839-D40C-44D7-AFCC-11C32E1FF1A8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54410f79c86e22.28644528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
