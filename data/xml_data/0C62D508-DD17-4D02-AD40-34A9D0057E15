However, every day patients are diagnosed with autoimmune diseases and nobody really understands why immune safeguard mechanisms have failed. We have described a new factor named BAFF/BLyS, which acts on a subset of immune cells and promotes their survival. Overproduction of this factor leads to the inappropriate survival of harmful immune cells and tissue destruction by these cells. Importantly, the serum of patients suffering from autoimmune conditions contains high levels of BAFF. We have collected evidence suggesting that subsets of white blood cells might have an adverse role in the progression of BAFF-led autoimmune disorders and inflammation. In this project, we would like to identify harmful white blood cells, how they abnormally develop and molecules specific for these cells to be used as targets for therapeutic intervention in various autoimmune diseases. The aim of this work is to find ways to refine treatments of autoimmune diseases by targeting pathogenic cells while preserving the healthy side of our immune system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BAFF, a new member of the TNF family of ligands, is a critical survival factor for B cell, essential for their maturation and maintenance in the periphery. My previous work has shown that mice overexpressing BAFF develop autoimmune disorders similar to lupus and Sj&amp;ouml;gren?s syndrome in humans and that high levels of BAFF were detected in the serum of patients with various autoimmune conditions. Excess BAFF possibly allows inappropriate survival of autoreactive immature B cells in the periphery and their harmful accumulation and activation. Yet, elimination of self-reactive B cells via cell death by the immune system is not the only safety mechanism preventing B cell autoimmunity in the periphery. Anergy is another mechanism induced by self-antigen that inactivates self-reactive B cells, which then become non-responsive to antigen-specific activation. As BAFF transgenic (Tg) mice develop autoimmune diseases despite the presence of multiple safety mechanisms preventing B cell autoimmunity, it is very important to verify whether mechanisms of anergy are still operational in these mice. Recently in my lab, we accumulated a body of evidence suggesting that a subset of B cells named marginal zone (MZ) B cells may play a central role in tissue damage seen in BAFF Tg mice. This project outlines a series of experiments using MZ B cell-deficient mice to confirm their role in autoimmunity in BAFF Tg mice. In addition, via gene profiling analysis we have identified a number of MZ B cell-specific genes, which may encode for proteins critical for MZ B cell function and homing. This project proposes to dissect the function of these molecules, which may be used as therapeutic targets to eliminate MZ B cells in autoimmunity, while preserving the healthy B cell side of our immune system. Finally, the emerging role of BAFF as a costimulator of T cell activation may unveil a number of critical functions for BAFF in T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases and new possibilities for the trment of these conditions. This project has the potential to generate unique discoveries allowing a greater understanding of mechanisms triggering autoimmune conditions as well as the possibility of developing new strategies for therapeutic intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>911512</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G117/534</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
