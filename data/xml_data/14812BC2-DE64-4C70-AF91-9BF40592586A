A better understanding of the virus biology is urgently needed to develop more effective means to combat influenza.||The virus binding to cellular receptors is essential for infection. It is believed, in particular, that avian influenza viruses do not readily transmit in humans because of viral non-optimal receptor-binding specificity. There is a theory that peculiar receptor specificity of the 1918 virus could be partially responsible for the unusual severity of the Spanish flu pandemic. This programme is seeking to fill the gap in our understanding of how the virus interacts with its receptors and how these interactions contribute to emergence of influenza pandemics and to disease severity. ||First, we will specify molecular structure of receptors for viruses from different avian and mammalian species using new high-throughput receptor-binding assays supplemented by computer-aided molecular modelling and X-ray analysis. ||Second, we will compare interactions of avian and human influenza viruses with cellular receptors in humans using a new experimental model, cultures of human respiratory epithelium. This model will allow us to mimic closely features of influenza infection in vivo. These experiments will help to explain why avian influenza viruses do not readily infect humans and which mutations could allow viral adaptation to humans and initiation of a pandemic. |Third, we will study how distinctions in the viral receptor specificity affect their ability to elicit pathological changes in various human cells typically present at the infection site, such as, granulocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes. This information may be crucial for the development of new approaches for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Influenza viruses continue to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. A better understanding of the virus biology at the molecular level is required to develop more effective means of prevention and control and to increase pandemic preparedness. The virus binding to sialic acid receptors on target cells is essential for initiation of the infection. In addition, virus binding to other cell types can lead to important biological effects, for example, dysfunction of neutrophils and polyclonal activation of B-cells. The broad objectives of this programme are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of interactions between influenza virus and cellular receptors and to assess how these interactions contribute to virus host range and pathogenicity. These objectives will be addressed by the following specific aims. Aim 1 will study the structure of sialyloligosaccharide moieties recognised by human and animal viruses. We will test binding of various influenza viruses to carbohydrate arrays containing structurally defined receptor analogues (collaboration with the Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, Moscow, Russia). To explain specific receptor-binding phenotypes in terms of atomic interactions between the HA and the receptor, we will complement binding data by molecular modelling and by X-ray analysis of some of the HA-receptor complexes (collaboration with Structural Biology at NIMR). Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms, by which receptor specificity of animal influenza viruses restricts their replication in humans. This aim will be achieved by using recently established cultures of differentiated human airway epithelial cells that closely mimic airway epithelium in vivo. We will employ reverse genetics to generate influenza viruses that harbour hemagglutinins and neuraminidases from different avian and mammalian viruses in the identical genetic background. We will determine differences between these viruses in their capacity to replicate in cultures prepared from different regions of human airways. We will next study whether different virus fitness in airway cultures depends on viral affinity for receptors on susceptible cells, sensitivity to neutralisation by mucins, cellular tropism, release from infected cells, or other mechanisms. This information will specify the host-range barriers that limit emergence of pandemic viruses from animal precursors and will determine receptor phenotypes and identify specific animal hosts that might facilitate transmission of animal viruses to humans. Aim 3 will use natural and recombinant viruses with distinctive receptor specificities to study biological effects of viral interaction with sialic acid receptors on immuno-competent (neutrophils, dendritic cells, B-, T-, and NK-cells, etc). Previous limited studies demonstrated potential significance of these effects for influenza virus pathogenicity, however, any correlation between the receptor-binding characteristics the viruses and their ability to cause these effects has yet to be investigated. These studies will be performed in collaboration with Infection and Immunity at NIMR.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>589414</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U117585870</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
