Most strikingly, at least five human bodies have been recovered since 1993. The first one found was a well-preserved head, complete with hair and beard, associated with a boot which preserves part of the lower limb, a pair of textile shorts, three knives, a silver ear pick, a sling, a length of rope, a grindstone, a walnut, some pottery and textiles fragments, and some further bone. This body was recovered during open cast mechanical quarrying. In November 2004, mining activities were again brought to a halt by the discovery of a second body, this time largely consisting of fragmentary bones, but with some traces of soft tissue, hair and beard remaining. Subsequent controlled excavation resulted in the recovery of three further bodies, one of which was very well preserved, being fully clothed and carrying items of personal equipment. Large quantities of textile, wood and other material was also recovered, but not directly associated with the bodies.\n\nPreliminary examination and dating showed that three bodies were dated to c. 400 BC, whilst two were attributed to the Late Sassanian period (c. 400 - 600 AD). Isotopic data on body tissue and hair, however, suggested that two at least of these individuals may not have come from the region around the mine, posing an interesting question about how the mine was operated in antiquity.\n\nWe propose to carry out a much fuller analysis of the human remains, to understand their state of health and nutrition at death (remembering that the unique character of these remains - undoubtedly killed by accidental crushing - means that they are very rare and reasonably well-preserved prehistoric examples of humans killed whilst fully fit and active), but also to investigate further the possibility that they may have travelled from some distance away to collect the salt. There is no archaeological evidence of habitation around the mine, and so it seems likely that exploitation was by occasional visit or seasonal activity rather than by permanent miners. In the contemporary Greek world, we know that mining was often the task of slaves. This therefore has important implications for how we view the social organization of the late Achaemenid and Sassanian period in Iran.\n\nThere is ample evidence for mining activity in the form of pick marks on the walls, but also from the remains of wooden pegs, and even complete tools with wooden handles and metal picks. There are also food remains and coprolites. The excellent organic preservation provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct the activities which went on in the mine. We also have considerable amounts of textile preserved, which need to be examined to determine fibre type, weaving technology and dying technology, since such material of this age is obviously rare. From the technology and design of the textiles, we expect to obtain additional information about the origins, both geographically and socio-economically, of those who worked in the mine.\n\nWe also know that there is at least one more human body to be recovered from the mine, which will be done by the Bochum team (who are seeking DFG and/or ICHTO funding for this, as well as to make a complete record of the prehistoric mining activity). We will coordinate our activities iso that the PDRA osteologist can be present during this recovery, and subsequently carry out a complete examination and sampling of the remains.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work, and the related project to be carried out by the Bochum Mining Museum, will have a significant impact on Iranian archaeology and tourism. The mine is currently still being blasted as a rock salt quarry. Because of the importance of the materials recovered, demonstrated by the preliminary report recently published in the journal 'Iran', the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourist Organisation (ICHTO) have begun negotiations to buy the site and stop the mining. They also plan to develop the site as an important visitor attraction (possibly seeking World Heritage Site status), and construct a new museum to display the human remains and associated artefacts. The work proposed here will have a significant impact on this development. At a higher level, it will also serve to promote archaeological and scientific collaborations between UK, German and Iranian archaeologists.\n\nWe have also been approached by a TV documentary company (NHNZ Media), who have been in discussion with National Geographic about the production of a documentary about the mine and its contents. They have been waiting for an indication that we have the money to carry out the work before signing an agreement to produce the film. It is highly likely therefore that the work of the German and UK teams would form the basis of an internationally disseminated documentary programme. This is in addition the media exposure that we have already had for the first stage of this work in Iran (I was interviewed live on Iranian breakfast television on my last visit).\n\nThe archaeology of Iran is exceptional both in terms of quantity and quality, and the ICHTO are working extremely hard to persuade the Iranian Government (sometimes against the grain of political thought) that partnership with outside experts is of great benefit to gaining a better understanding of Iran's past. This project will therefore have great symbolic value in demonstrating that such partnerships can be mutually beneficial.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>426125</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has continued beyond AHRC funding as a DFG funded project involving Bochum, Oxford and Zanjan.
