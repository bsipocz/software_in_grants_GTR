This poses significant challenges to reconstructive surgeons whose role it is to reconstruct bone and soft tissue defects following loss due to a myriad of potential causes. These include bony defects that children are born with, termed congenital defects, or those that they acquire through life because of injury or surgery for cancer. Because the skeleton performs such an important job to provide form and also to protect underlying structures and organs such as the brain it is often vital for functional and cosmetic reasons that these defects be reconstructed.

Current approaches used by surgeons to replace missing bone in the facial skeleton or skull - collectively called the craniofacial skeleton - include replacing it with bone borrowed from elsewhere in the body of the same person such as the hip (autologous bone), bone borrowed from another individual (allogeneic bone) or artificially produced man-made materials (prosthetic materials). Each of these approaches carry significant drawbacks. Taking bone from elsewhere in the same individual can lead to complications at the site from which the bone was borrowed (donor site) and of course there is a limit on how much bone can be borrowed when this approach is taken. This can be a problem if trying to reconstruct very large defects. Taking bone from someone else can lead to problems of the recipient's immune system trying to fight the foreign tissue just like, for example when the body tries to fight an infection. To stop this happening drugs can be given to the patient to suppress their immune system but these drugs carry side effects. Man made material can be effective but when they get infected it can be very problematic.

The ideal solution is to try to improve the ability of the craniofacial skeleton to heal itself. This may mean that we could avoid the techniques above altogether or at least make the defect smaller prior to any procedure.

It has been shown that during development the different flat bones that make up the skull are derived from different types of cell in the developing fetus. The paired parietal bones that lie at the sides of the skull are derived from different cell types from the frontal bone which lies at the front. Interestingly parietal bones heal more slowly than frontal bones. Cells get their instructions to develop in a certain way from either signals carried in the blood stream or signals from other cells. It has been identified that certain types of signaling in the frontal bone give rise to its superior ability to heal. We are studying these signaling pathways that give a healing advantage to see if we can in the future promote skeletal healing capacity. By identifying differences in the signaling between frontal and parietal bone cells we hope to identify ways of improving craniofacial bone healing with specific drugs.
We will be conducting experiments analyzing bone healing on mice in the first instance, as they are mammals, like humans, and have been postulated to behave in a similar way. One of the novel signaling molecules that we have identified in our comparison experiments, Sostdc1, might be a key player in regulating the healing ability of bone. We have mice that are known to have lower levels of this signaling molecule so we hope to compare healing in these mice with normal mice and also the ability of bone cells taken from these mice compared to normal mice, to form bone. Our ultimate goal is to identify ways of modulating how equivalent bones in humans heal using certain drugs that can modify signaling. This would be of tremendous benefit to the large numbers of patients who have sometimes devastating craniofacial skeletal defects and therefore also a benefit to society at large.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Craniofacial skeletal reconstruction is challenging because the capacity of skeletal tissue to regenerate is poor. Autogenous bone, allogeneic bone and prosthetic materials carry drawbacks. Identifying targets for future pharmacological modulation of calvarial regeneration is the goal. The skull vault is made up of disparate embryonic origin. Frontal bones arise from neural crest and parietal bones from paraxial mesoderm. Frontal bone osteoblasts have a higher osteogenic potential than parietal, conferring an enhanced healing capacity to frontal bones. Certain signaling pathways determine this difference. 1: Identify genes expressed differentially at specified levels of significance, in frontal and parietal bone. Obtain bone samples from wild type mouse parietal and frontal bone. Perform microarray analysis and identify any significant differences in gene expression. Use preliminary microarray data from e15.5 and e 18.5 mice to provide insights into which subpopulations of genes might be appropriate to investigate. 2: Identify differences in gene expression between frontal and parietal bone at the healing edge of calvarial defects. At 24, 48 and 72 hours following the creation of a 2 mm calvarial defect, a 1 mm rim of bone will be taken. DNA microarray analysis will be performed on these samples to analyze gene expression profiles during healing. 3: Comparative in vitro osteogenic assays and in vivo calvarial defect healing assays in frontal and parietal bones in wild type and Sostdc1-/- mutant mice. From preliminary F v P microarray data in e15.5 and e18.5 mice, the Liu lab has identified one key regulator, Sostdc1. Sostdc1 is a signaling molecule that dually inhibits BMP and Wnt, and is expressed robustly in frontal bone. Mouse mutants in Sostdc1 have a short skull, indicating its requirement for ossification of the head. The role of Sostdc1 will be investigated by performing the same assays as for aim 2 in the mutants, and by assessing healing using microCT.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Nations Health:
Reconstruction of the craniofacial skeleton represents a significant biomedical burden to society, principally because the inherent capacity of mature skeletal tissue to regenerate and repair is poor relative to other tissues. The United States Healthcare Utilization project for example, noted that over 50,000 craniotomies and craniectomies are performed each year in the United States costing the taxpayer over $585 million in medical care which represents a huge economic burden. The economic burden of skeletal disease as a whole is even more expansive. In the UK the economic cost of hip fractures alone including medical and social care is &amp;pound;2 Billion. Furthermore, acquired and congenital large bony defects which can ensue following trauma, oncologic resection and fracture non-union frequently expose the inadequacies of currently employed surgical techniques which rely on a combination of autogenous, allogeneic and prosthetic materials. While autogenous bone reconstruction can deliver favorable results it is restricted by the amount of tissue that can be harvested and donor site morbidity. Allogenic bone grafting, on the other hand, is plagued by the need to combat immunological rejection. Although prosthetic materials have provided solutions to certain reconstructive problems, these modalities have not provided optimal results in reconstruction of skeletal defects. 

The long-term objective is to devise a novel approach that enhances the regenerative response at the site of skeletal injury. We focus on the embryologically determined differences in regenerative capacity of neural crest-derived frontal and paraxial mesoderm-derived parietal bone. Achieving a better understanding differences in signaling will allow us to identify suitable molecular targets for selective pharmacological modulation in order to potentiate healing. This could have a tremendous economic and health impact in the UK and globally.

Aiding the development of a skilled workforcein the UK
It is well know that the field of academic surgery is diminishing in the UK. Very few surgeons choose to enter basic sciences research and few possess the lab skills necessary to perform this task. An MRC grant would allow me to complete my PhD and provide me with a foundation to launch my academic career as a surgeon-scientist in the UK and promote a culture of academic interest in the surgical community.

Academic impact 
In the last 13 months I have gained experience in the field of regenerative medicine research at Stanford University. During my time there I have acquired the ability to perform small animal surgical procedures that are not currently performed at Kings College London. They include calvarial defect surgery, unicortical long bone and long bone fracture surgery and parabiosis surgery. The award of an MRC grant will give me the opportunity to bring these skills to bear on the projects I will perform during the duration of my grant at KCL.

Impact on the academic community, industry and the public at large
As described, skeletal pathology and the problem of treating fractures and large skeletal defects pose a significant biomedical burden. It is therefore important to raise public awareness of this problem. I intend to disseminate any potential novel findings through meetings, publications and if applicable through the media. This will raise the profile of this topic and accelerate the development of novel therapeutics. While I concede that our study is at a very early stage identifying suitable targets for pharmacological modulation is the long-term aim. Close collaboration with industry and dissemination of data will potentially help the development of agents such as specific small molecule inhibitors that would promote bone healing. This could therefore benefit industries such as the pharmaceutical injury to guide development novel small molecule inhibitors of signaling pathways. This would potentially help the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>767A9320-12EC-472E-A7F0-3453916AC34B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Small Molecule Inhibition of Transforming Growth Factor Beta Signaling Enables the Endogenous Regenerative Potential of the Mammalian Calvarium.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tissue engineering.
