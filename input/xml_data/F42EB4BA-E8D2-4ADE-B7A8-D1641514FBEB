&lt;p>A renewed interest among policymakers in the patterns of ?knowledge accumulation? (through R&amp;amp;D) and spillovers (the Newtonian idea of ?standing on the shoulders of giants?), and the means to benefit from domestic and international knowledge investments for economies at different stages of development is the prime motivation for this research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In developed economies industrial policy claims certain sectors are ?more important? than others and provides them with generous support; in the developing world experts express concerns over a reduction in spillovers from agricultural knowledge investments in the rich countries and a limited domestic base for agricultural productivity increase.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will use novel panel econometric methods to revisit knowledge production and diffusion at the sector level (agriculture, manufacturing, services), allowing for a number of innovations in the flexible modelling of production and the distinction between knowledge spillovers and global economic shocks which may distort the existing spillover analysis. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The questions addressed in this proposal are currently widely debated in policy circles in terms of (a) the re-emergence of industrial policy in OECD countries; (b) the recognition within institutions such as the World Bank and UNIDO that the industrial structure (agriculture, manufacturing, services) of less developed economies and the production and transfer of knowledge play central roles in the development process; (c) the concern over an increasing misalignment in agricultural R&amp;amp;D between developed and developing countries voiced at the G20 summit in Cannes, meaning that significant knowledge spillovers from the former aiding productivity increases in the latter may no longer materialise. 

In the UK the insights and conclusions from this research will be of direct interest to researchers and practitioners in the public policy sector, including the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the UK Intellectual Property Office, nesta, the Department for International Development, the Overseas Development Institute as well as NGOs, think tanks and interest groups in the fields of innovation and international development. 

Beyond the UK, findings speak to researchers and practitioners in the public administration of developed and developing economies as well as international organisations such as the OECD, UNIDO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).

Patterns and magnitudes of knowledge spillovers are of great interest to policymakers in developed and developing economies. However, leaving aside concerns over the identification of true spillover effects, the insights gained from existing research are typically limited to relatively broad statements, which frequently do not lead to policy-relevant recommendations, e.g. &amp;quot;on average the combined impact of R&amp;amp;D investments in six [OECD] countries close to the world's technology frontier [on other OECD countries]... is at least three times as large as that of [the latter's] domestic R&amp;amp;D&amp;quot; (Acharya &amp;amp; Keller, 2009). It is not clear that 'stop domestic investment in R&amp;amp;D' represents a sensible strategy for sustainable development. 'Transmission channels' through which knowledge was said to diffuse were typically not so much explored as imposed, leaving limited lee-way beyond a stark 'yes' or 'no' for judging the importance of alternative channels. 

The empirical innovations applied in this research put considerable emphasis on working out both commonalities and differences across countries and sectors: 
- in the OECD project research will establish (i) the interconnectedness between countries and sectors in terms of economic shocks; (ii) the major knowledge sources (production and diffusion) amongst countries and sectors, (iii) the relative importance of various transmission channels for different countries and sectors, recognising they may employ different technology; 
- the LDC manufacturing project will provide insights into (i) what forms of (non-R&amp;amp;D-measured) innovation have proved productivity-enhancing for different countries, (ii) what role, if any, (high-tech or other) knowledge creation in OECD countries can play in LDC manufacturing development, (iii) the relative importance of various knowledge transmission channels for economies at different stages of development; 
- the LDC agriculture project will establish (i) the private returns on investment in agricultural R&amp;amp;D taking account of global shocks and spillovers, (ii) what role, if any, agricultural R&amp;amp;D in OECD countries plays for agricultural productivity in LDCs, as well as (iii) changes in these relationships over time.
There is thus considerable potential for the proposed research to address the heterogeneous needs for insights into the patterns and magnitudes of knowledge accumulation and spillovers in diverse sets of countries as developed above.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>179869</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DF1F1C82-9C56-439F-BF85-BB1D05AC51C3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Role of Crop Type in Economic Development</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1"><gtr:id>821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eberhardt, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d8651b3875f8.46399298</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95110B2A-8FA3-4A37-A8F7-279F7096568C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Magnitude of the Task Ahead: Macro Implications of Heterogeneous Technology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1"><gtr:id>821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eberhardt, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9ccc461cc95.97583994</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>35E0C7E4-A09C-4F92-866C-2CE9D86B1520</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Effect of Agricultural Technology on the Speed of Development</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>World Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c172adb65c874704aaf880f35714703"><gtr:id>9c172adb65c874704aaf880f35714703</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eberhardt M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d53b6b04b20.36529372</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B055370-2025-4031-9B43-4274708E4C6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Effect of Agricultural Technology on the Speed of Development</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>World Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1"><gtr:id>821853ea7f629fa25ba24f38d9dafcb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eberhardt, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dea5efe2e399.46788059</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B4681AF7-977F-4D20-A9E3-AB0272D1453A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Measuring Productivity and Absorptive Capacity Evolution in OECD Economies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09c0b8b6e1ee4638c6f1bd33934d7e81"><gtr:id>09c0b8b6e1ee4638c6f1bd33934d7e81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stef De Visscher</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9d4a4d0e734.24686333</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K008919/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>50992D59-4D34-4EAD-9A21-B3ADAF426DA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Organisation (R&amp;D)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71E94BA5-333E-4F49-9ECA-60771CC7532E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
