(CAPP2)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M006468/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In most plants, growth rate is limited by the rate at which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken up and converted to sugars in the process of photosynthesis. The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be increased and plant productivity would be higher. There is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in unicellular green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. During the initial CAPP1 programme, we discovered important new information about this mechanism, and using new and rapid methods we have identified novel algal genes and additional regulatory components which allow the CCM to operate in association with a specific micro-compartment called a pyrenoid. We have also successfully introduced some of these components into a model higher plant, Arabidopsis, and also successfully introduced a modified form of Rubisco which may facilitate aggregation into the pyrenoid. The ambitious goals of the CAPP2 extension will be to combine the expression of the CCM and pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant. Firstly, we will continue to identify genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and develop new markers and sensors to reveal the location and activity of these genes when expressed in the higher plant. Secondly, we will identify additional regulatory elements needed to form a pyrenoid, as well as exploring the impact on Rubisco enzyme efficiency and light utilisation. Thirdly, we will continue to introduce successive components into our model Advanced Plant so as to &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; up the activities of CCM components and examine the extent of pyrenoid formation and enhanced productivity associated with the CCM. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The CAPP2 programme will continue to discover and characterise new components of the Chlamydomonas CCM, in addition to known bicarbonate pump(s) and carbonic anhydrases, and identify regulatory elements, protein modifications, linkers and chaperones needed to aggregate Rubisco into a pyrenoid and progressively incorporate key components into Arabidopsis. Our approaches include:
1) Identify and characterize components of the pyrenoid in Chlamydomonas, including growth phenotyping, complementation to identify the mutant locus and fluorescence tagging to identify prenoid-associated proteins. Pyrenoid defects will be screened from microscopy, Rubisco kinetics, CCM physiology and light use.
2) Pyrenoid structure, assembly and regulation will be defined using block-face scanning EM in Chlamydomonas and Advanced Plant chloroplasts. Chaperones and linkers will be identified using AUC and BN-PAGE, and other post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and S-S bond forma tion by LC-MS/MS.
3) To assemble a pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant gene cassettes will be assembled and/or stacked into delivery vectors for transformation. Additional &amp;quot;known&amp;quot; CCM components will be introduced and location tested by fluorescent tags (e.g. GFP), and levels of untagged components by polyclonal antibodies. Repression of all native Rubisco in Arabidopsis double mutants, and CCM characteristics will be combined in a single plant.
4) The advanced plant lines will be characterized physiologically to determine effectiveness of introduced CCM.
5) A FRET nanosensor will be developed to allow bicarbonate pools accumulated through the CCM to be visualized.
6) Modelling of inorganic carbon accumulation and effectiveness of pyrenoid operation will be undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at UIUC Illinois.
7) A central repository of genetic tools and materials will be developed for open access to the scientific and commercial communities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Academics and researchers in all fields of plant research.

2015: Our publication (DOI: 10.1111/pbi.12497) and the broader scope of the project was discussed on an online interview with Garnet (http://blog.garnetcommunity.org.uk/arabidopsis-research-roundup-november-13th/)

2016: A new, high-impact educational tool and participated in outreach for young school children (4-12) and their parents during the Scotland Midlothian science festival (http://midlothiansciencefestival.com/). Their objective was to teach the public about the importance and shortcomings of Rubisco, the primary carboxylating enzyme in photosynthetic organisms. 

2016: Spin off work, based on application of our vector database to other biological systems, has resulted in two funded projects (Phyconet and IBIOIC) with industrial partner Scottish Bioenergy to produce high value products in cyanobacteria. 

2017: online interview with Garnet discussing recent publication in New Phytologist journal Rubisco small subunits from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas complement Rubisco-deficient mutants of Arabidopsis (DOI: 10.1111/nph.14414).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F526339C-B2DC-415A-AAEE-E32D47CF6CFD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54539b470c0ca3.90499582</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Towards Aim 3A (Express further &amp;quot;known&amp;quot; components important for pyrenoid function):
We have assembled a comprehensive vector database (see database section) for assembling all known and newly discovered CCM components (Jonikas/Griffiths labs) into single or multi-gene cassettes that can target algal and cyanobacterial CCM proteins to appropriate sub-cellular locations in plants. Successful introduction of several of these into higher plants was outlined in Atkinson et al. (2016, 2017). 

Towards Aim 3B (Assess expression and location of untagged CCM proteins): 
Localisation of modified CCM transporters HLA3-GFP and LCIA-GFP to the chloroplast envelope has been confirmed by confocal imagery and immunoblotting against GFP. We have constructed new vectors lacking the GFP-marker and have now ordered antibodies for LCIA and HLA3 to track protein expression. We have also ordered antibodies for a new protein identified by the Jonikas lab during this project, EPYC1 (Meyer et al., 2016). 

Towards Aim 3C (Remove remaining native Rubisco small subunit (SSU)):
We have utilised CRISPR/Cas9 approach to remove 3 SSU genes located at a single chromosome locus. The approach has this far shown that we can generate deletion events in this locus with appropriate sgRNAs. 

Towards Aim 3D (Combine CCM characteristics in a single plant):
We are have now developed multi-gene expression lines carrying between 2 and 4 gene expression cassettes and have transformed these into Arabidopsis for analysis. 

Towards Aim 3E (Introduce novel pyrenoid components and chaperones): 
As new CCM components have been identified and verified by the Jonikas and Griffiths labs, we have started to work with these in Arabidopsis. In particular, we are currently investigating the recently identified algal Rubisco linker protein EPYC1, and how it interacts with higher plant Rubisco.

Towards Aim 4 (Characterize Advanced Plant lines):
Work to generate and characterise plants with clear evidence of Rubisco aggregation akin to a pyrenoid is ongoing. As in Atkinson (2017), we have generated pyrenoid-compatible Arabidopsis expressing the algal Rubisco-SSU required for pyrenoid assembly, and have shown that this form of Rubisco is near-equivalent to native Rubisco, in terms of functionality and growth complementation. Notably, we have provided new evidence that the Rubisco SSU plays an important role in the catalytic characteristics of Rubisco.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Work is ongoing, not applicable this year.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>822461C6-F950-4DE9-A31B-326B17F75EE5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54539c08dce5a2.55356810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://mccormick.bio.ed.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>BBSRC workshop to discuss new crop breeding technologies</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C037FE3-E984-45F6-AE2E-87FA61F7F5AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Led to publication of a position statement by the BBSRC on new and emerging techniques for crop improvement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dcb5194520a0.89419827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/documents/genetic-crop-improvement-position-statement-pdf/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Proposed Centre of Expertise in Plant Health - Stakeholder Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3809A015-93B7-4C24-8CCC-6CDC6C05BD9C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dcb6867779b5.89605210</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scotland.landscapeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scottish-Plant-Health-Strategy-draft-strategy-2016-2021-151126.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a detailed and comprehensive database of Gateway- and Golden Gate-based vectors containing plant-domesticated parts of the biophysical Chlamydomonas and cyanobacterial carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs).
