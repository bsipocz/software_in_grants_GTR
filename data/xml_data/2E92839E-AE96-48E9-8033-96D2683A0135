Each C*-algebra is a set of continuous linear maps from a Hilbert space to itself, closed under a few natural algebraic and analytic operations. Upon their inception, it was quickly realised that C*-algebras can be created in canonical ways from many other mathematical objects, modelling such things as symmetries, time-evolving systems, and large data sets. Time and again, interesting relationships have manifested between properties of the object being input and those of the resulting C*-algebra.

For some time, it has been quite clear that different constructions can produce the same C*-algebra; this is interesting externally, where it may imply a profound relationship between the differing input data, and internally, where it allows single C*-algebras to be studied using the different techniques available from each different way of constructing it. However, a thorough elucidation of what conditions on the input objects produce different C*-algebra outputs has yet to be achieved. Achieving this goal amounts to classifying C*-algebras: showing that suitable, computable invariants (primarily, K-theory) are sufficiently sensitive to always distinguish different C*-algebras.

It has recently become apparent that to classify C*-algebras, one should study regularity properties of the C*-algebras - certain properties of C*-algebras that indicate they are less complex and more tractable. Regular C*-algebras are ones that have low (topological) dimension - in a way that exactly generalises dimension of a space. Just as low dimensional spaces are easier to visualise, it is often easier to prove things about them, to the extent that certain things that are true of all low-dimensional spaces are no longer true in higher dimensions. This carries forward to C*-algebras: more and better things can be proven about low dimensional C*-algebras than high dimensional ones. Returning to classification, it has been shown in many cases that C*-algebras whose invariants take the same value are automatically the same (or isomorphic), provided that the C*-algebras have low dimension.

I have been involved in research concerning regularity, and have found that a certain recent tool called W*-bundles shows tremendous promise, although its fundamental theory has yet to be developed. From a C*-algebra, one produces a W*-bundle, and uses this as a tool.
This works because:
(i) the W*-bundle has more structure, and it seems that it should be easier to prove things about it than about the C*-algebra;
(ii) the W*-bundle has a very special relationship to the C*-algebra - it contains it in a special way - so that facts about the W*-bundle can have important implications for the C*-algebra.

The aim of this project is to further our understanding of structure and classification of C*-algebras, by developing the theory of W*-bundles.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will involve contributing to pure mathematical research. Research undertaken will be published first on the arXiv preprint server, and then in high-quality journals. This will make them accessible and noticed by other mathematical researchers internationally.

I will have opportunities to present my research to large audiences while in M&amp;uuml;nster, both through the Geometry and Actions workshop and in a departmental seminar. This will increase the prominence of my work and foster connections between my work and the work of others. Research undertaken during my visit will be further disseminated in later talks.

The project contributes to a better understanding of C*-algebras generally. The impact of the research will be both within the subject of C*-algebras and beyond. Objective (C) specifically concerns interactions between C*-algebras and other areas of mathematics, so that the resulting research will have an impact in these areas. The quantum mechanical motivation for C*-algebras means that better understanding of the general theory of C*-algebras may have implications in mathematical physics.

Finally, as is the general rule with pure mathematical research, the biggest impact is likely to be very long-term, and its specific manifestation will be unpredictable and perhaps surprising.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4033</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In joint work with White and Winter, I demonstrated a new link between the study of symmetry (group theory) and operator algebras.
