that is, inequalities in health which result from social, economic or political factors and unfairly disadvantage the poor and marginalised - are trapping millions of people in poverty. Unless they are tackled, the effort to fulfill the promise of universal health coverage as part of the fairer world envisaged in the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals may lead to more waste and unfairness, because new health services and resources will fail to reach the people who need them most. In Mozambique, for example, the gap in infant mortality between the best-performing and worst-performing areas actually increased between 1997 and 2008, despite improvements in health indicators for the country as a whole. However, while many low- and middle-income countries are failing to translate economic growth into better health services for the poorest, some - including Brazil - stand out as having taken determined and effective action. One key factor that differentiates a strong performer like Brazil from a relatively weak performer like Mozambique is accountability politics: the formal and informal relationships of oversight and control that ensure that health system managers and service providers deliver for the poorest rather than excluding them. Since the mid-1990s, Brazil has transformed health policy to try to ensure that the poorest people and places are covered by basic services. This shift was driven by many factors: by a strong social movement calling for the right to health; by political competition as politicians realised that improving health care for the poor won them votes; by changes to health service contracting that changed the incentives for local governments and other providers to ensure that services reached the poor; and by mass participation that ensured citizen voice in decisions on health priority-setting and citizen oversight of services. However, these factors did not work equally well for all groups of citizens, and some - notably the country's indigenous peoples - continue to lag behind the population as a whole in terms of improved health outcomes.

This project is designed to address the ESRC-DFID call's key cross-cutting issue of structural inequalities, and its core research question &amp;quot;what political and institutional conditions are associated with effective poverty reduction and development, and what can domestic and external actors do to promote these conditions?&amp;quot;, by comparing the dimensions of accountability politics across Brazil and Mozambique and between different areas within each country. As Mozambique and Brazil seek to implement similar policies to improve service delivery, in each country the research team will examine one urban location with competitive politics and a high level of economic inequality and one rural location where the population as a whole has been politically marginalised and under-provided with services, looking at changes in power relationships among managers, providers and citizens and at changes in health system performance, in order to arrive at a better understanding of what works for different poor and marginalised groups in different contexts.

As two Portuguese-speaking countries that have increasingly close economic, political and policy links, Brazil and Mozambique are also well-placed to benefit from exchanges of experience and mutual learning of the kind that Brazil is seeking to promote through its South-South Cooperation programmes. The project will support this mutual learning process by working closely with Brazilian and Mozambican organisations that are engaged in efforts to promote social accountability through the use of community scorecards and through strengthening health oversight committees, and link these efforts with wider networks working on participation and health equity across Southern Africa and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's main impact goal is to help ensure that better-quality health services reach the poorest and most marginalised people in Brazil and Mozambique, by making use of the strong links with key policymakers and practitioners in both countries already developed by the research team (see CVs). It also includes strong engagement with academic, policy and practitioner audiences in other fields. The impact strategy will include the following key activities:

This well-attended session discussed some important accountability challenges relating to the role of the private sector, and a major outcome was an agreement on future activities focusing on the role of health accountability in formal and informal private sector engagement in health systems, which will be one of the key themes explored in a July 2017 event on health accountability to be held at the Institute of Development Studies which will include some of the key policymakers, academics and practitioners who participated in the TWG meetings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca83350d4002.16135640</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.healthsystemsglobal.org/blog/111/Join-us-at-HSR2016-in-Vancouver-to-discuss-the-role-of-health-markets-in-managing-antibiotic-use-and-addressing-antimicrobial-resistance.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement meetings with District Health Councils in Brazil</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>053969C4-924A-413D-BEF7-768DCDAAF6FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CEBRAP research team in Brazil participated in two health council meetings for the Cidade Tiradentes and Sapopemba municipal districts within the municipality of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo.

The aim was to get these stakeholders to engage with the research. As a result, the team now has support within the districts and authorisation to proceed with the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c17b0bb771d5.60638053</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IDS Conference: States, Markets and Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21275857-4C05-47D9-842D-BCE93CDC02C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project's PI and Co-Is were involved in the design and delivery of three panels at the IDS 50th anniversary conference which brought together approximately 200 researchers, policy actors, civil servants, practitioners, postgraduate students and members of the general public to discuss the role of states, markets and society in sustainable development. Denise Namburete (CoI from N'weti, Mozambique) participated in the panel exploring 'Are there legitimate roles for NGOs between society, markets and the state?', which was organised by PI Alex Shankland. Research findings from the work of Vera Schattan Coelho (CoI from Cebrap, Brazil) and PI Alex Shankland was presented at the panel 'Beyond Widgets: transforming accountability for better health and nutrition delivery'. Gerry Boom (Co-I from IDS) organised and chaired the panel 'Beyond &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; in health systems' and contributed to a plenary debate on the political economy of structural change in development. Their work generated particular interest from researchers, policy actors and prospective donors (including the Future Health Systems Consortium and the Open Society Foundations) on the possibilities for further development of the health accountability agenda, including future collaboration on this project's research and engagement agenda.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589dad17f10349.01360929</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/states-markets-and-society-ids-50th-conference</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although the case study research is still under way, the project's initial evidence review, case study scoping and engagement activities have generated valuable findings on the determinants of effective use of service user feedback to drive accountability in a way that improves health equity. The most significant uptake has been by the Ministry of Health in Mozambique, which has invited project Co-I Denise Namburete (N'weti) to join a working group preparing the establishment of a National Health Observatory and to advise on the incorporation of user perceptions of service quality into the health sector performance review framework. We have also begun very promising contacts with key international policy processes including the WHO health systems governance initiative and WHO/USAID task force on health governance and accountability, and we expect to build on these further by engaging with key members of these networks at a major international event on accountability for health equity that the project is co-convening in July 2017, at which key emerging research findings will be presented.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>621E153E-4EBA-4E5C-8A47-7B635262302D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca8838eaf3b1.82052336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Drawing on project discussions and analysis, Co-I Denise Namburete (N'weti) provided inputs to the performance review process for the health sector (Avalia&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Conjunta Anual, Sector de Sa&amp;uacute;de) with a focus on reshaping the review methodology to include citizen perceptions of service quality</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A944C22-F4D7-4FB6-B01C-DD4C01C1D595</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b7ffe1888b66.73952939</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The project research team have compiled, abstracted and tagged a Zotero database consisting of more than 300 key references on accountability and health equity in English, Portuguese and Spanish.
