(www.bigsocietyresearch.com) was a networking project that brought together academics from multiple disciplines as well as governmental, charity and private sector individuals to discuss existing research relevant to the 'big society', to identify research gaps, and to brainstorm future research directions.

The project ran four interdisciplinary workshops, each based around a central theme relevant to 'big society'. Key gaps identified were: (1) Lack of an evaluation framework for planning and measuring social innovation interventions. Despite hundreds of case studies in citizen-led societal change, there is no single repository for lessons learned and few guidelines for future initiatives; (2) Lack of research into institutional structures that support localism. Universities and organisations are often structured in a way that is in conflict with citizen-led initiatives (cf. the individuality of PhD study). Research should be undertaken to suggest new organisational structures; (3) More research into the concept of 'listening'. A big issue in any locally-oriented initiative is the ability to listen to a full cross section of community voices; (4) There is a need for a structural macroeconomic model to analyse the current faults in the system and to evaluate from an economic perspective the value of localism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32371</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>4 Workshops with Industry, Academic and Government</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E77CBBE3-5BCC-4EC3-AD22-AFF10E27A0B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>4 workshops

course, lies not just in the ideas it generates 
(and the workshops did this in spades), but also 
in the connections between people that are 
made. The eclectic mix of disciplines and 
backgrounds in this project has created new 
strands and challenged researchers' established 
way of thinking. The project has identified a 
number of research gaps, which are 
summarised below:
1. Although there have been many attempts at 
case studies for social innovation, these are 
not 'joined up', which makes learning lessons
and replication very difficult. The first 
project recommendation is for a research 
programme that will make a detailed 
study of historical and current case studies 
and based on these, devise guidelines for 
successful social innovation projects. These 
guidelines could include both qualitative 
and quantitative elements.
2. The second project recommendation 
is a research programme to investigate 
whether we need new forms of institutional
structures to better support connected 
communities. For example, PhD study 
emphasises the work of the individual, 
which seems to be opposed to the notions 
of collaboration and community. Research 
should be instigated that looks at the 
structures of universities and government 
and devises new forms of organisational 
working that better support and involve 
communities. 
3. Finally, one interesting proposal that 
came out of the Inclusion workshop was 
a research programme based around the 
concept of 'listening'. A big issue in any 
locally-oriented initiative is the ability to 
listen to a full cross section of community 
voices. This problem is shared by research 
projects (who to sample?) as well as 
government. A proposal was made for a 
project that would examine the properties
of listening and being listened to as a 
democratic human process. 
4. On the financial side, there is a need for a 
structural macroeconomic model to analyse 
the current faults in the system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9CFAFA90-AF2B-45B5-A4A2-8FE2937223BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ca4617e4886.91097856</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I507647/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
