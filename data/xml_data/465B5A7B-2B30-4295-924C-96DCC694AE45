In recent years, his prolific and diverse writing - including other novels, tales, poems, songs, plays, and essays - has become more widely known, in large part due to the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of his collected works (S/SC), published by Edinburgh University Press. The most common thread running through his career, however, was his engagement with periodicals: he was a prolific contributor. He began in the 1790s by sending poems and songs to the Scots Magazine and wrote for periodicals ranging from literary magazines to agricultural journals until the very end of his life. His collected work for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine was recently published in the S/SC, and editions of Hogg's contributions to other Scottish periodicals and to Fraser's Magazine are in preparation. Hogg's periodical writing ranged far more widely than this, however, and this uncollected work is spread across many dozens of titles and several continents. While Hogg's relationships with the Scottish publishing world have become well documented, other than some intriguing hints, little research has been done on Hogg's writing published in periodicals beyond Scotland.

Filling this significant gap requires a critical edition of Hogg's writing for magazines and newspapers in England, Ireland, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The first aim is to identify and locate original and reprinted items that appeared in a wide array of outlets, and to collate them for the first time into a single volume, Contributions to International Periodicals. Edited by Adrian Hunter and contracted for publication by Edinburgh University Press, this critical edition will complete the available record of Hogg's writing, and will include many items that have never before been reprinted. Secondly, this project aims to provide a reliable, scholarly text. It will account for the composition, publication, and reception of each piece, and provide full explanatory notes, glossary, and an index. It will present a scholarly introduction that explains these materials in relation to Hogg's career, and that contextualises them within early-nineteenth-century print culture. Thirdly, the research will clarify how readers outside of Scotland received Hogg's writing and how these audiences participated in the literary culture of Romantic-era Scotland. As part of the critically-acclaimed Stirling/South Carolina edition of Hogg's collected works, Adrian Hunter and Suzanne Gilbert will author an article that takes up the question of whether the reception and reproduction of Hogg's work contributed to the creation of a Romanticism that is distinctively Scottish. A public exhibition, 'James Hogg in the World' will be staged at Stirling in 2017, to coincide with the Scottish Government's 'Year of History, Heritage, and Archaeology', and will illustrate how Hogg's work connects - from his lifetime to the present - with cultural history and heritage in the wider world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As detailed under *Academic Beneficiaries*, the research will be of significance to an international audience of scholars engaged in the study of James Hogg, early-19th-century literature and culture, Scottish literature and the Scots diaspora, transatlanticism, publishing history, and the short story. Not only will these readers be provided with a first authoritative text of Hogg's contributions to periodicals and newspapers published overseas, but they will also benefit from the textual and contextual apparatus associated with the principal output (*Contributions to Various Periodicals*), as well as the PhD project.

Beyond academia, the research has potential benefits for a general public both at home and abroad. By curating and preserving the work of a central figure of Scottish letters, and making it available for the first time to a wide international readership in the form of a book publication, the research contributes in tangible ways to Scottish Government's stated mission for the Arts and Culture in Scotland, which is to promote awareness and understanding of the 'dynamic heritage' of Scottish culture, and to 'raise the profile of Scotland at home and abroad' in order that 'as many people as possible in Scotland and overseas are able to benefit from, be inspired by, and enjoy the very best of Scotland creative and culture offerings'.

In order directly to engage the general public in the research, a free-to-enter exhibition entitled 'James Hogg in the World' will be staged in the Crush Hall gallery space at the University of Stirling. The exhibition will run for three months in the summer of 2017, and will showcase the findings of the project by demonstrating how Hogg's work travelled round the English-speaking world in the author's day, and how his influence has continued to be felt particular in North American literature. Key foreign editions of Hogg's books will be displayed alongside periodicals in which his stories and poems first appeared. Drawing directly on the primary research undertaken during the project, supporting text will explain what publication in these particular venues reveals about the reach and significance of Hogg's writing to overseas readerships, including the Scots diaspora. The exhibition will be arranged into sections including 'Transatlantic Hogg', 'Antipodean Hogg', and 'Hogg in Ireland'.

The exhibition will be supported by a large-scale global map, situated in the main hall, that plots the the routes of dissemination and transmission of Hogg's work around the world. This will assist visitors in gaining an appreciation not only of the reach and range of Hogg's writing, but the size and composition of his readerships abroad.

Occurring in 2017, the exhibition will benefit from association with the Scottish Government's 'Year of History, Heritage, and Archaeology' initiative, by highlighting Hogg as an historical figure whose work has connected, and continues to connect, a global Scots diaspora. The PhD project, on Hogg and the short story, will be utilised to engage a particular group of beneficiaries -- local secondary school pupils -- by tracing Hogg's presence in Canada, and specifically in the work of the contemporary Canadian writer Alice Munro, a descendent of Hogg's who has frequently taken up his texts in her own fiction. Working in conjunction with Edinburgh University Press, free printed copies of Hogg's story &amp;quot;The Cameronian Preacher's Tale&amp;quot; will be disseminated to senior school pupils, and this story will complemented by a feature in the exhibition on the Cameronians in Canada. Project staff will host visits to the exhibition by pupils, where the Cameronian legacy and the stories will be discussed.
