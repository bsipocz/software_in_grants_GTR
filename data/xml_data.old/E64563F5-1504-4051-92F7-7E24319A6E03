British military</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001926/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Since the 1990s, increasing attention has been paid to how geographies of global politics are represented through popular culture, such as films, radio and magazines. Despite the enduring war play debate, children and toys have typically been excluded from these discussions. At a time when militarism is increasingly imprinting on everyday geographies well beyond areas of actual armed conflict, a grounded cultural commentary on war play and how children develop understanding of geopolitical climates is urgently needed. Working in partnership with the V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood this project analyses how military technologies and logics are made banal - alike through children's play with action figures, and thus the role of toys in the making of the citizen. Based on an innovative methodology developed as part of previous ESRC awards, this project uses interlinking strands of trade, museum and home based ethnographic research to ask:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How has the history of the British action figure been shaped by wider geopolitical climates?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What geopolitical narratives have shaped, and are shaped by HM Armed Forces (HMAF) toys?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do children make sense of contemporary geopolitics through play with HMAF toys?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How can toys be used as an educational tool for understanding historical/contemporary geopolitical climates?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Whilst children's war play is a topic of perennial interest, discussion and debate by educators, parents and the media has varied in intensity in relation to localised events of violence, specific periods of military engagement and publication of high profile parenting texts. Despite this attention, grounded cultural commentaries are lacking as studies of war play have focused on short-term effects and examined play in isolation from wider geopolitical climates and cultures. Given this context, there are a myriad of non-academic beneficiaries and users of this research:

Project Partner: The MOC has been enthusiastic about this research and its potential contribution, as well as contributing to the framing of research questions. The planned 2013 War Games exhibition marks a move towards the MOC's engagement with more controversial topics. They will be able to use outputs at all stages of the research to inform exhibition resources and museum-practice. Two longer-term impacts are the value of our partnership in enhancing the research capacity of the MOC, and the development of creative methodologies for family-centred audience research. By extending the MOC's profile among academic communities and advancing its status as a platform for reflection on contemporary issues, this collaboration will contribute to the MOC's strategic objectives concerning access, audiences, and international renown (V&amp;amp;A 2011).

Public/third sector curatorial organisations: Other curatorial institutions will benefit from best practice in child/family-centred audience research and understanding of social practices of meaning-making. Military-focused museums will benefit from insights into, and ways of intervening in public understanding of conflict and security. This is marked by the inclusion of Portsmouth's Fort Nelson on the Project Advisory Board.

Security think tanks: Public understanding of conflict and security, and the development of political subjectivity are considered critical for defence policy. The Royal United Services Institute's (RUSI) War and Culture Programme, which promotes appreciation of how cultural interpretations of conflict influence society's construction of war and its consequences, is indicative. This research expands RUSI's current focus on the arts by considering an unduly neglected, yet important popular culture form, toys.

Ministry of Defence: The recent 'Youth Engagement Review' (MOD 2011) details the role of service outreach programmes in meeting the statutory responsibility for Service Children and wider personal and social development of young people. In-depth understanding of the development of political subjectivity and understanding of geopolitical climates will contribute to this critical, yet currently low profile area of defence policy.

Parents and the wider public: Given its engagement with wider historical/geopolitical contexts, this research offers a more grounded cultural commentary on the demoralising nature of children's war play. It will enhance understanding of how children's play is embedded in/reproduces wider geopolitical imaginaries and logics, and the role it plays in the making of the citizen.

Educators: Educators have been at the forefront of the war play debate, with war toys being banned in many school environments (Holland 2000). With continued Western engagement in the Middle East and the 'Arab Spring', war induced suffering shows little sign of abating. Thus, it is important to help children develop an understanding of geopolitical climates. Working with a learning consultant to create KS2 learning resources, this project will develop ways of using play and toys as tools for understanding geopolitical issues. Local schools have been enthusiastic about involvement in the research.

As the Pathways to Impact statement makes clear, representatives of these types of organisations have been involved in the design of this project and will be included on the Project Advisory Board.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>395245</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Inspiration Federation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Learning Resources</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0016AF0-9193-4063-B31A-5C6545A2825A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Drafts for three KS2 learning resources</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5697b2e1ed8ce3.92006342-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Inspiration Federation contributed knowledge of the British school curriculum and experience of producing learning resources to this collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research team drew on their experience of visitor engagement with the V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood's War Games exhibition to collaborate with Inspiration Federation to create a set of Learning Resources based on war toys.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Victoria and Albert Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>V&amp;A Museum of Childhood</gtr:department><gtr:description>Impact Acceleration Award bid for funds</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0B99969-0E98-46BF-960E-7AFB0EC4F430</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funding application</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb27b4555a39.82207337-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Drafted, costed and submitted funding proposal to University of Exeter scheme for ESRC Impact Funds</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaborative funding bid for further funds to measure impact of collaborative initiatives</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Portsmouth</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Sociology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Sensing War</gtr:description><gtr:id>87F850CF-F331-4642-AB11-3EBA46D05168</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multi-disciplinary.

With toys and games, as well as photographs and archive documents, War Games represents differing sides of conflicts from around the world. It reveals the sometimes surprising links between play and wider attitudes towards warfare, and delves into the secret history of toys as tools of propaganda and espionage. The exhibition was originally hosted at the museum's London site, before travelling nationwide.

It was a tie-in to a forthcoming exhibition at Plymouth Museum entitled 'War Games', which had been devised by the Museum of Childhood, and which the Ludic Geopolitics research project had been observing as it travelled the country. The event was to talk to teachers about how this exhibition could be used for school visits, what resources were available to support this, and how it connected to the National Curriculum. The spakers were the Head of Education from the Museum of Childhood, and representing the Ludic Geopolitics project, Sean Carter. Sean spoke about the research that we have been undertaking with the exhibitions, some of our more general findings on links between war and play, and about the supporting educational resources that we co-designed with the MoC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58beb406cc8b73.41400256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC World Service TV interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F6135CE-2792-464C-97F4-F41191962606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An interview for the BBC World Service - the BBC's global television channel - as part of the Global programme.

These talks have sparked questions and requests for further information about the project. These talks have been offered to the public for a minimal fee, providing additional funds for the museums involved and drawing additional visitors to the exhibition. 

The team has also produced an exhibition trail for children to encourage visitor engagement, and KS2 and 3 learning resources for use in museum outreach programmes for schools. Impacts TBC. As part of the research the team have been monitoring and measuring visitor engagement with the War Games exhibition as it has travelled around the country (through participant observation, interviews, analysis of feedback postcards and child-focused activities). These findings have been summarised in a series of reports, each tailored to the specific needs of particular museums. Measurement of impact relating to these reports is ongoing. 

The team has also been involved in a practitioner focused workshop, which introduced the possibilities of a playful approach to museum workers (from around the UK and across different kinds of museum) for engaging exhibition visitors. Ideas were received with interest with participants developing their own thoughts on how they could be applied to their specific contexts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0C82DD5A-50F7-4F93-9C79-5F6F7F6E8BBF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e02d5071d772.78558558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Preliminary findings:
Despite the many ways that the lives of children are affected by contemporary conflicts, their experiences of war and thinking on war is marginalised in both popular discourse and academic research on cultures of war and militarism. 

This study adopted a methodologically innovative approach that worked across historical and contemporary sites of trade, exhibition, education and family life. Such a multi-sited approach is necessary to more fully understand the role and significance of popular culture on the formation of childhood political subjectivity; furthermore it allows the complexity and agency of the multiple actors involved to be recognised. By undertaking extensive research on children's war play practices in domestic settings, this study provides new empirical knowledge on the relation between childhood, wider cultures of war, and children's everyday practices. In contrast to work on the politics of popular culture that tends towards over-determining the outcomes of exposure to or engagement with, various forms of culture, this research shows that each site of production/consumption has its own set of politics and negotiation; these are highlighted below.

(i) The production of a toy-object such as Action Man or the HM Armed Forces action figure is the outcome of a complex set of relations between individual designers, corporate strategies of toy manufacturers, wider geopolitical climates, and the political-economies of the toy trade. This makes claims concerning the intended ideological intent of particular products hard to sustain. 

(ii) The placing of toy-objects into a museum display clearly positions them differently than in their normal 'domestic' settings, such that they are not so obviously used as play objects. The more reflective practices that museum spaces encourage allow for different kinds of insights into the relationship between war, toys, play, and violence. These insights both problematize assumed gendered and violent connotations of war toys and war play, and reveal that such engagements with war toys - both playful and reflective - are shaped by cross-generational relations and practices.

(iii) The home, whilst a crucial setting for understanding the actual ways in which war toys are played with, has been an overlooked site of analysis in research to date. This study shows that domestic spaces of play are key sites for the development of childhood political subjectivities through the negotiation of a complex set of relations between the individual and the wider world. More specifically, it reveals that:
? Despite concerns around the ideological role of war play, play itself is an embodied, open-ended activity that cannot be over-determined or explained prior to observation of its practice. 
? War play, as a form of childhood geopolitical practice, shows the ways in which children articulate their understandings of the geopolitical world through play.
? Furthermore, observing war play shows how children begin to re-work and re-imagine these geopolitical imaginaries.

Overall, this research shows that considerations of war play should not be restricted to concerns with aggression and violence; rather, we need to recognise war play does not take place within a social vacuum. War play is informed and shaped by (amongst other things) toys, play settings, wider geopolitical climates, other intertextual cultural references, and existing historical knowledge (in relation to existing historical knowledge, links between topics and issues learnt at school and the content of domestic war play emerges as a potentially important new research question). War play is thus an important means for children to make sense of the contemporary world. Furthermore, this study clearly shows that there is potential for using play as a vehicle for reflecting on and questioning prevailing geopolitical logics and cultures of militarism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are developing both academic and non-academic pathways to impact. 

For multi-disciplinary academic audiences this includes editing a journal special issue; publication of book chapters in key reference texts; a range of journal articles (submitted/in preparation); and a series of presentations at international conferences, workshops and seminars, many by invitation.

We have been/are engaged in a range of different activities with non-academic audiences:

? In collaboration with the Museum of Childhood (MOC), we developed KS3 learning resources, for use both in conjunction with their War Games exhibition and as standalone activities. We also participated in workshops, led by the MOC, for School Teachers planning to visit the touring exhibition.

? Created additional resources for the MOC War Games exhibition; we delivered public talks, workshops, tours and online essays for the exhibition.

? Conducted visitor research both at the MOC and museums across the UK, as the exhibition toured, with summary reports produced for each venue. 

? Engaged with broader publics through a project blog, published articles written for a general audience, and media events (TV, radio and press interviews, at national/regional levels).
