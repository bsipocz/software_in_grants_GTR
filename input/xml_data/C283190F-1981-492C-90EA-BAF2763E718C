Marston was one of the most important playwrights of the early modern period: he is equal in significance to such well-known dramatists as John Webster, Thomas Middleton, or John Ford. The author of a dozen surviving plays, including 'The Malcontent' and 'The Dutch Courtesan', two volumes of verse and two courtly entertainments, he was an original and idiosyncratic voice. He competed and collaborated with the most important writers of his time, including Shakespeare, Jonson, and Chapman, and the impact of his highly distinctive style can be seen in the turn towards a more satirical and aesthetically self-conscious mode of writing English drama after 1600. 

Marston's works have never been properly edited as a body. The last collected edition was published in the 1930s, but its contents are incomplete, its textual work is unreliable, and its scholarship is long out of date. The new edition will bring together all Marston's poems and plays for the first time, and will scrutinize exhaustively the many early printed editions, and the handful of manuscripts, in which his works survive. It will establish an authoritative text on critical foundations; provide up-to-date and informative introductions and commentary; and endeavour to resolve the disputes over authorship which bedevil Marston's works. Many of Marston's works came into print anonymously, or without close oversight from their author; a number are collaborations with one or more authors. As a result there are considerable problems in defining the extent and limits of the canon. Six plays will need close linguistic scrutiny in order to determine whether they belong to the canon in whole or part (or, indeed, at all).

The son of a lawyer and a resident of the Middle Temple, Marston belonged to the cultural world of the Inns of Court, where London's lawyers and young gentlemen enjoyed a society notable for its sophisticated and avant garde tastes. He wrote predominantly for the 'private' theatre companies, the troupes of adolescent actors performing for elite audiences at London's indoor playhouses, whose theatrical style was often subversive and challenging. This project will explore the background of Inns of Court society in depth in order to illuminate the context from which Marston's writing emerged and the intellectual and political concerns with which he engages. It will use practical workshops at the recently opened Sam Wanamaker Theatre (at the London Globe) -- which is a modern reconstruction of a playhouse similar to the kind for which Marston wrote -- in order to illuminate little-understood features of his dramaturgy and road-test a range of scenes from different plays in historically sensitized conditions. This will allow the editorial work on play texts to be informed by perspectives derived from practical study of them as performed drama.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to establish a place for Marston in England's cultural and theatrical memory as a major figure, whose works deserve to be revived and carry the same kind of significance as those of his better known contemporaries such as John Webster or John Ford. The major non-academic beneficiaries will be: 

(a) The publishers, Oxford University Press. The print edition will be published as part of the prestigious stable of Oxford editions, and will appear simultaneously in modern- and old-spelling format on the OUP digital platform, Oxford Scholarly Editions Online (OSEO). The Oxford Authors series has long been the series of choice for authoritative complete editions of major writers, and the Marston edition will extend the existing range by drawing another important writer into the collection. Oxford Scholarly Editions Online is a prestigious new OUP venture associated with the Oxford Authors series, and currently comprises 380 searchable editions of writers active between 1485 and 1788, a total and chronology which are actively being extended. One particular effect of the dual Marston format (parallel modern- and old-spelling, not currently attempted by OSEO) will be to develop the digital functionality of the OSEO series.

(b) Creative and performance organisations: Shakespeare's Globe and the newly opened Sam Wanamaker Theatre. Together these two theatres are one of London's leading tourist attractions and an internationally recognized venue for the performance of plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries. The Globe, which has no regular public subsidy, maintains a high public profile through its publicity, website, and Twitter feeds. It had audiences of 400,000 in 2013, and 8,500 people attending the programme of public events, including the long-running 'Read Not Dead' play-readings, a 30-year series which has already featured some Marston plays. Its educational programme drew in a further 80,000 high-school students. Its mission is both to promote Shakespeare and explore the work of lesser-known contemporaries such as Marston, while pursuing public outreach and performance-as-research in its historically-informed playing spaces. The Sam Wanamaker Theatre, currently enjoying its first season, was built in order to extend this mission to drama written for indoor venues, of which Marston's work is a prime early example. The edition will potentially extend the SWT repertoire and the workshops will contribute directly to the performance and research activities of the theatre and its public programme for 2017. Other theatre companies with similar missions -- such as the Royal Shakespeare Company, which regularly hosts seasons of rare early-modern plays at the Swan Theatre -- are likely to benefit from the availability of new texts and our enhanced focus on under-explored aspects of the Marston canon. 

(c) Professional group/historic public institution: the Middle Temple. The concluding conference will be held here because of Marston's long-standing residence at the Middle Temple. Beside its function as a professional meeting place for London's legal community, Middle Temple Hall is well-known as a venue for private and corporate events. Our conference will draw renewed attention to its historic and cultural associations, and to the Inns of Court heritage more generally.

(d) The wider public in general. The edition will have a long-term impact in making available all Marston's works for reading and performance, and drawing him to the notice of theatre-goers, readers of plays, scholars, students, and individuals with an interest in the history and culture of early modern England. This is the core non-academic constituency which the Wanamaker events seek to address, and which will also be the target of other channels such as the edition blog.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>715621</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Birkbeck, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of English and Humanities</gtr:department><gtr:description>John Marston attribution studies and techniques</gtr:description><gtr:id>2EF32A3B-7606-4E61-9CFB-DA2EDD88F3AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes are still in process.
