In the aftermath of the genocide that shook the world, how do you picture this small East African country? And who has shaped these images? Who are the photographers, storytellers, reporters, editors and filmmakers who have influenced your imagination? My research examines how Rwanda has been 'curated' for international audiences - the visual and verbal stories told about genocide and its aftermath and the ways in which they have been disseminated globally.

In 1994 between 800,000 and a million people were killed in Rwanda in just one hundred days. Many of these killings took place in people's homes or nearby public spaces. After genocide survivors often returned to where they lived before, to the sites where they lost hundreds of friends and family members. These killings and the process of rebuilding life after genocide, are grounded in an intimate knowledge of a particular place. However, during genocide and its aftermath many Rwandans were displaced. And the first international stories about Rwanda were told by foreigners mostly travelling to the country for the first time. 

Familiarity with place then, in Rwanda, is intimately tied to the question of authorship. Survivors giving testimony about genocide recollect sites of killings, the places where people hid, routes out of the country. Accounts by influential visiting journalists and novelists by contrast dwell on the strangeness of the landscape and disorientation. To understand experiences of genocide we need to listen to local people who lived through the events and are still grappling with their consequences. But to understand how Rwanda has been perceived internationally we must also pay attention to the narratives of outsiders. 

This fellowship begins with two writing projects that study and contest these dynamics. My monograph Rwanda: The Testimony of Place, examines how the field of testimony has been shaped and is changing the further we move from 1994. My translation of Yolande Mukagasana's testimony La mort ne veut pas de moi will bring a key Rwandan voice to English-speaking audiences for the first time. 

I then develop these themes of place and authorship building on my existing networks established while making the BBC documentary Living with Memory in Rwanda and curating the AHRC-funded exhibition Rwanda in Photographs (2014). Exploring my Rwandan colleagues' observation that Rwandans have little control over narratives circulating about them internationally, I will map ways in which stories about Rwanda are consistently mediated by outsiders from the Global North, and challenge these dynamics through interventions designed to foreground Rwandan voices. 

In 2018 I will convene a workshop facilitated by photographer-activist Marcelo Brodsky (Argentina) and writer-editor Billy Kahora (Kenya), bringing together Rwandan photographers and writers with NGOs based in Rwanda. The workshop aims to demonstrate that NGOs can benefit from working with local artists as opposed to flying in foreign journalists for their communication campaigns, and offers valuable training and networking for participants. Slideshows in Kigali and London will share the results and selected work will be published in a journal special issue.

Accompanying the workshop are three further interventions: A policy briefing for photo editors outlining the business and ethical case for commissioning photography locally rather than internationally; A quantitative study co-authored with social psychologist Dr Keon West showing why this is important for humanising the people depicted; And a visually-rich website drawing together my own research and images generated over the past five years of engagement activities.

This fellowship will establish me as an emerging leader in post-conflict cultures, providing time to complete two key publications and funding to forge new ways forward through projects that combine both academic research and cultural activism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how?

Rwandan survivors, returnees and young people
In the current context of revisionism, survivors' testimonies about the genocide in Rwanda have a vital role to play in bearing witness to historic events, with tangible benefits for other survivors and their dependents. In translating Mukagasana's memoir and co-publishing in the region, it will become available to English-speaking Rwandan audiences for the first time, in particular returnees who grew up in Anglophone countries and young people schooled after the country moved from French to English. 

Rwandan artists
Rwandan photographers who participated in my previous workshops described them as transformational because: they invited participants to set their own agendas about the stories they wished to tell; and showed aesthetically innovative images from other cultural contexts to inspire work that participated in creating rather than simply reflecting the world. My current proposed workshop will provide a platform for photographers and writers to reflect on the place of creativity within their personal and commissioned work, expanding their professional range and ambitions.

International and Rwandan NGOs
NGOs hosting writers and photographers from the workshop will benefit from new networks and material. Working with local photographers offers a large potential cost-saving for international and local NGOs currently commissioning international photographers to visit Rwanda to generate campaign materials. Photo editors commissioning local artists foster an ethics of dignity and self-dependency whilst inviting more creative responses to development than existing NGO metanarratives.

Rwandan and international news agencies
International news publications unable to support their own staff photographers increasingly print NGO funded photography or buy images from photographers commissioned to be in country by international NGOs. This project will add Rwandan voices to material available, increasing choice and ideally quality.

Arts organisations and their beneficiaries
Arts publications and international prize committees, such as Wasafiri, SABLE LitMag, the Caine Prize, Commonwealth Writers' Prize and Sony World Photography, often complain about the lack of entries from smaller African countries. Our proposed workshop provides mentoring to produce photography and short stories in English that can be entered for such publications and/or prizes. The proposed Wasafiri special issue will be co-edited by myself and Billy Kahora (Kenya), fostering international North-South collaboration in publishing with the benefit of sharing resources and networks. 

Policy-makers
Policy-makers working for government organisations such as DfID and British Council, alongside researchers at development think tanks and research funders, will benefit from the increased evidence base for the value of locally-authored stories and photography. In addition, think tanks researching the Great Lakes will be able to source their own Rwandan photography through the project website.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students
Over the past few years university courses examining the genocide in Rwanda have grown exponentially at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. My Mukagasana translation brings a key testimonial text to Anglophone students for the first time, whilst my monograph will provide both analysis of well-known texts and fresh perspectives on understudied material, particularly photography and recent writing. 

Wider reading public 
My previous research shows that audiences are more likely to perceive Rwandans as complex human beings after seeing Rwandan photography. The monograph, translation, slide show and Wasafiri special issue will bring Rwandan-authored narratives to wider audiences with the benefit of opportunities to learn about Rwanda from Rwandans, hopefully accompanied by positive change in attitudes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P00492X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>235118E8-E88E-48B8-AC83-F773D1C74EB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Middle East &amp; African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
