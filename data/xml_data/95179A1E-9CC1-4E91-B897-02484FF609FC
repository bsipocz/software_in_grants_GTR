While there have been research conducted into the individual cinemas variously identified as 'Chinese', such as the cinemas from the People's Republic, Taiwan and Hong Kong, there has been relatively little systematic research into the finer nuances that constitute, or indeed, problematise, this notion of a Chinese identity.\n\nEnglish-language writings on a generic Chinese cinema rarely address the linguistic and cultural differences within Chinese cultures itself, for example, the suppression of vernacular dialects in favour of Mandarin, the cultural politics of dubbing and subtitling even for films shown in Chinese territories, the representation of minority cultures and the cultural politics between ostensibly 'Chinese' dialect groups and communities. In addition, the state and cultural policies that determine what gets produced and distributed need to be considered. These include the exploration of material histories, such as what material has been lost to history (whether to war, neglect, and other exigences), and how that shapes our understanding of the body of work identified as 'Chinese cinema' today.\n\nMoving beyond the Greater China region, even less has been said on the cinema/s of the Chinese diaspora, whether that in South-east Asia or Europe and America. Do these films contribute to the larger body of work understood as 'Chinese cinema'? If not, what is the nature of their Chinese-ness; or, if so, how much of that Chinese-ness is dissociated from the geo-political entity called 'China'? Much work remains to be done on Chinese cinemas in Western territories: What is the impact of the new transnational Chinese cinemas on Asian-American directors, for instance? And where are British Chinese represented in British film cultures? In addition, transnational Chinese-ness is often taken to be the crossing of Chinese cinema into Western markets, but in reality because of small home markets, Chinese language cinemas have looked beyond its own shores from the beginning. Hong Kong cinema, for example, has always looked towards South-east Asian and Western Chinatown markets as part of its distribution network. Indeed the Shaw Brothers production studios in its hey-day during the 1960s and 70s had production units in Malaysia and Singapore, producing not just Chinese-language features, but also Malay-language ones.\n\nIn the wider international arena, many Chinese films are seen today within the context of an international film festival culture, including that which may be perceived as 'commercial' rather than 'arthouse'. More research needs to be conducted on the politics of selection at these festivals, and how the political economy of the festivals themselves can determine what gets seen internationally and what does not. Who defines what constitutes 'Chinese' cinema? Is it the Chinese themselves (however they are defined)? The producers? The audience? The state? Festival juries? Or a complex interaction of all of the above?\n\nAs a cross-institutional body, the network is well-placed to undertake the exploration of these issues as it is able to draw on the strengths of both academic and public sector partners with links to industry that will be of value to the project. As such the network views its public engagement activities as equally crucial as the academic research being undertaken.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By raising the profile of Chinese cinemas, and the associated research, through an extensive public engagement programme the CFFUK network will benefit the arts and culture industries, the academic community, as well as the wider public. This aspect of its work will assist in setting the agenda for future academic studies of film festivals and seasons and the inter-relationships between the academy and the culture industries. A list of potential impacts include: \n\n1. Creating an awareness of global Chinese cinemas and therefore assisting in growing the audience for Chinese cinemas, initially within Greater Manchester, and then across the UK and beyond\n2. Providing a body of knowledge regarding Chinese cinemas that can be utilised by those working within the culture industries through consultancy with the network\n3. Raising the profile of Chinese cinemas in the UK and thus encouraging UK film distributors to acquire more films for distribution and exhibition\n4. Supporting the work of arts and cultural institutions such as Cornerhouse and the Chinese Arts Centre by working in partnership with them\n5. Providing a sustainable model for collaboration that arts and cultural institutions will be able to utilise in future collaborative initiatives with the academy \n6. Establishing international links between the UK and other overseas partners, archives, scholars, and practitioners\n7. Enhancing the position of Manchester as a cosmopolitan and global city, situated at the cross-roads of multiple cultural flows, and contributing to the city's dynamic calendar of cultural activities.\n\nResearch will be disseminated through conferences, symposia, public talks, educational programmes and curating film seasons. Prior to its formation, members of the network have already been engaged with these issues on different projects independently, thus the network aims to bring together these resources and energies more productively.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>One Hour Intro/ Popular Taiwan Cinema Beyond the Arthouse</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B339C1AC-F3E4-457E-AFE3-B4CC31CE5D6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pre-screening introductory talk, setting the context of the film for the audience.

Audiences for these films, related talks and panel discussions were enthusiastic, and a number of films played to sold-out houses. One of the most fruitful aspects of this work was the opportunity to take the discussions beyond the confines of academia and to engage the general public. Consistent attendance and the return of regulars as well as new audiences at each event prove that a core audience has been cultivated. The CFFUK used social media to stay in touch with our audiences and currently have a combined following of over 400 across Facebook and Twitter, not including those signed up to Cornerhouse's own mailing lists, which promotes CFFUK's events. Currently their weekly email list reaches over 12,500, their Twitter followers number 43,300, and Facebook fans 9,700. (reported in 2014)

Since then the CFFUK as a network continues to work with HOME, Manchester (formerly Cornerhouse) and other partners on programming and presenting new features, premieres and film seasons to the public that have not received commercial distribution.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>55902A4A-F0A0-49A7-A4B1-B0F463560048</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b9966267307.13770844</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The CFFUK provided a model for the collaboration between academics and the cultural industries, particularly in the field of film exhibition.
