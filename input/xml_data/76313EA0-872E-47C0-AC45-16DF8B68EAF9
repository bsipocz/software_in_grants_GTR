Ofsted and the National Audit Office (NAO) have highlighted problems recruiting teachers and developing attractive career paths for those entering the profession. Centralised pay determination is deemed part of the problem since it is unable to respond to workers' outside options in local labour markets (Britton and Propper 2016). In 2012 the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB) argued: &amp;quot;The current pay system is rigid, complex and difficult to navigate and does not support schools to recruit the high-quality teachers or leaders&amp;quot; (DfE 2012). It recommended increased flexibility in determining teacher salaries and greater discretion in teacher recruitment and retention. It also recommended linking teacher pay to excellence and performance improvement, with higher rewards and more rapid progression for the most able teachers. The reforms came into effect in 2013 for new teachers and for all in 2014 (STRB, 2013) and provided &amp;quot;maintained&amp;quot; schools with powers Academies already had. There is currently no evidence on its effects on schools, teachers or student attainment. This study will fill this gap in knowledge, and will assess to what degree the reform can help recruit and retain teachers.

It is unclear what impact the reforms might have had. First, there is little evidence regarding the value of performance pay (PP) in the public sector. The literature linking PP to increased output via worker sorting and incentive effects relates mainly to for-profit activities. The sorting and incentive effects of PP are less certain for public sector professionals where intrinsic motivation plays an important part in occupational choice and worker effort (Burgess and Metcalfe, 2000). Traditionally teachers have been rewarded through career incentives based on incremental pay progression and promotion (Prendergast, 1999: 10). Schools may wish to stick to &amp;quot;tried and tested&amp;quot; approaches given difficulties appraising the benefits of changing. On the other hand, schools may act in the knowledge that research indicates that the pay of teachers relative to other professions is an important factor in attracting high ability workers to teaching (Dolton and Marcenaro-Gutierrez, 2011). More broadly, there is no reason to suspect that efficiency wages should not affect worker effort and labour turnover in public sector occupations just as they do in the private sector.

Our study will compare the school-level distribution in teacher pay pre- and post-reforms, and whether this varies by school, teacher and regional characteristics. Using estimates of pay levels under the pre-reform regime to capture counterfactual wages, we will develop statistical tests to identify the schools changing their pay setting behaviour and compare them to those that did not. This classification of schools will allow us to examine the impact of the pay reforms on schools' ability to fill teacher vacancies, on the entry wages of new hires, wage progression among incumbents and teacher mobility within and across schools. We will consider the effects of the pay reforms on teacher retention and investigate whether the pay reforms changed teacher characteristics through effects on those entering and leaving the profession. Finally, we will examine how the pay reforms may have affected average student attainment at the school level.

The findings will interest policy makers concerned with the implementation and effects of the teacher pay-reform, academics interested in (de)centralised pay structures and PP in the public sector and educationalists with a focus on teacher labour markets. The results may also affect school leaders' propensity to depart from &amp;quot;tried and tested&amp;quot; pay practices to manage their school's workforce.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will inform policy on teacher pay, with associated benefits for teacher incentives, retention of good teachers and, thus, the quality of teaching in schools. As such, the findings will ultimately be important for pupils, parents, teachers, school governors, and head teachers, although this impact will be indirect through changes to policy and practice via the channels we discuss below. For pupils and parents, the aim of a better-informed policy on teacher pay is fundamentally about improving the quality of teaching and, thus, pupil performance. For school governors and head teachers, better teacher pay practices are about improving staff recruitment, retention and motivation at their schools.

We have identified four key groups on whom we wish to have impact. In addition to the academic beneficiaries already mentioned, the chief beneficiaries of this research will be policy makers, primarily in the Department for Education; schools, academy chains and local authorities (i.e. employers of teachers); and trade unions representing teachers and head teachers.

Policy makers: Civil servants and ministers within the Department for Education (DfE) are likely to find the research findings particularly relevant, especially those relating to the impact of the reforms on teacher pay, pay dispersion, pay progression and teacher mobility and sorting, and student outcomes. We have already approached Tim Leunig, policy adviser at DfE, who has intimated that the DfE would be keen to provide a representative for a stakeholder advisory group if the project is funded.

Schools, Academy Chains and Local Authorities (Employers): Our findings will be of considerable interest to schools, academy chains and local authorities, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether to deviate from prior pay setting models and what the consequences of such decisions might be. Representatives from these groups, or representative bodies such as the Local Government Association, will be invited to the one day impact workshop. We also expect to reach this group through our planned media outputs.

Trade Unions: Trade unions representing teachers and head teachers have expressed deep concern about the impact of incentive pay on wages and fairness at work, so will be interested in the impacts of increased teacher pay flexibility. Bryson has a close relationship with the TUC and is currently undertaking research for them on the impact of unions on employers and employees. Bryson has recently met with NUT's Deputy General Secretary to discuss the value of new data sources in establishing what is happening to teacher pay and careers. Our study will feed into policy formation at the TUC and its affiliate unions.

The one day workshop planned for month 12 of the study will bring together these practitioner and policy beneficiaries with academics in the field to discuss early findings from the study and their implications for policy and practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156445</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R00367X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
