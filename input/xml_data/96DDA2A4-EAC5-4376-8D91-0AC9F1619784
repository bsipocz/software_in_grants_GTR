Linking research data about their court cases with administrative records about children's subsequent care can provide an account of outcomes for children, which will assist professionals working in the family justice system to make better decisions about children in these proceedings. Supplemented with information drawn from children's local authority social work files and interviews with professionals responsible for services, the study will demonstrate the power and limitations of administrative data in understanding outcomes of care proceedings. This innovative use of administrative data will be useful to academics and non academics, developing knowledge of the effects of contemporary policy and practice in child protection, and enabling a systemic and interactive approach to understanding care proceedings. 

The DfE and Cafcass are project partners supporting research access to the administrative datasets.

In England and Wales, local authorities bring care proceedings in the family court to secure the protection of children where suitable arrangements cannot be made with parental agreement. The court's role is to make decisions and orders in the child's best interests, to secure justice for parents and children, and to hold the local authority to account. To achieve this it scrutinises the local authority's care plan and considers other proposals for the child's care from parents/ relatives and the child's representative (cafcass guardian). Decisions in these cases are necessarily based on a prognosis about the child's future care but courts obtain no information about what happens to children subsequently. This is true for most of those working in the family justice system (judges, lawyers, children's guardians, expert witnesses and social workers.
 
Following these proceedings, local authorities have the responsibility for implementing the care plan/order by looking after children subject to care orders, finding families for those subject to adoption plans and supervising or supporting supporting those cared for in their families. Administrative records are kept on each child in the care system or supported by the local authority, and these provide accounts of social care performance by local authority and over time. This study will use these data to provide an account of the care/service histories for a sample of approximately 290 children subject to care proceedings in 2009-11, collected in an earlier ESRC study of practice in 6 local authorities. Data from these proceedings provides a rich account of children's pre-care lives and the court process through which plans were scrutinised and orders made. Linking these datasets will provide a nuanced account of the impact on children's lives of the legal and social work process that are applied to them. 

In 2013, a new process for care proceedings (now PLO 2014) was introduced to secure case completion in 26 weeks, approximately half the time taken previously. Court powers to order assessments were controlled, making courts more reliant on information from the local authority. The study will draw a new sample of care proceedings brought by the same 6 local authorities in 2014 to compare processes, decision-making and outcomes for children after 1 year with those in the earlier data. This will establish the extent to which shorter proceedings are resulting in more timely decisions for children, different plans and orders in proceedings, and different outcomes for children one year after the final court order.

Outputs will include a report, summaries for family justice professionals, articles in academic law, social work and research methods journals, and for practitioners. There will be impacts on practice in child care and protection in the family court and local authorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit those responsible for, or working in, the family justice system, and the children and families who are subject to the system's processes. This includes:
1)The Family Justice Board, which has set improving outcomes for children as one of its strategic priorities for the family justice system but has no system in place to establish or measure these - the only information it has relates to court outputs and the timeliness of decisions. The new PLO with quicker proceedings and reduced resources for expert assessments and legal representation raises (currently unanswerable) questions about the impact on outcomes for children. By linking data, the project will show what can be learned about outcomes for children subject to the family justice system from existing administrative data, the limitations of that data, how data linkage can be achieved and what differences the new PLO is making.
2) Local family justice boards, which are responsible for the effective operation of the family justice system in their area, and include representatives from local services (local authorities, cafcass, HMCTS etc). Understanding the impact on children of process is central to their work. The PI and CoI are members of their local boards, and have experience of delivering training to lfjbs elsewhere. The findings in terms of outcomes and process will be relevant generally; there will be specific lessons in the study areas. 
3) Judges, who currently have no feedback about their decision-making other than its timeliness and (rare) decisions on appeals. Data linkage will enable judges to obtain systematic data on outcomes for children and local authority performance, which takes account of the characteristics and histories of the children. Such information will provide a firmer basis from which to understand the way children's needs are met and for performing the judicial functions of scrutinising care plans and making orders.
4) The Judicial College, which is responsible for judicial training will benefit by being able to draw on new bodies of knowledge on care proceedings process under the new PLO and on outcomes for children, to inform judges and support them in developing their capacity to case manage and make decisions in these proceedings.
5) LA social work policy makers, managers and practitioners already have access to analyses of this administrative data, so they can compare their authority's performance with others. However, these generally do not distinguish between children subject to orders and those looked after by agreement, take account of the role of the court in care planning or allow comparisons between outcomes for children in the same family, or placed with/without their siblings etc. Data linkage will enable the study LAs to have a significantly better understanding of the contribution of the court process to care planning, and of the outcomes for children of using legal process.This will provide the basis for their own assessments of the use of care proceedings (which vary substantially between authorities) and for developing local policy and practice. Elsewhere, the study will add to knowledge of the use of administrative data, its interpretation and limitations, and support practice learning about proceedings under the PLO and their impact on outcomes for children. 
6) Lawyers, who act in care proceedings will obtain an account of practice under the new PLO to support case preparation, presentation and decision-making, and for staff development.
7) Cafcass officers, who advise the court about children's welfare will have access to information about outcomes of care proceedings for children to inform their practice.
8) Children and families, who are subject to care proceedings will gain from improved decision-making by family justice professionals who are informed about the outcomes for children of care proceedings.
Overall, the research provides the basis for improved decision-making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>455788</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Miegunyah Lecture University of Melbourne -Understanding children's outcomes: the role of big data</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3E80A0B-F5C7-444F-A8A7-E2149D071075</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Practice in education and social care is beginning to refocus from examining inputs to outcomes.

Researchers at the University of Bristol have carried out the first detailed analysis of the impact of the 2014 PLO reforms on the decisions made by the courts. These decisions have major impacts for children, for local authorities who work with their families and for all professionals who act in care proceedings. The research findings will be presented for discussion and reflection in this seminar, which is open to all professionals working in family justice - social workers, social work managers, local authority lawyers, lawyers in private practice, cafcass workers, expert witnesses and members of the judiciary. 

The subject of the seminar is the first part of a study Establishing outcomes of care proceedings for children before and after care proceedings reform, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, which provides findings about other key aspects of the PLO including use of experts, judicial continuity and orders made. The study involved a detailed examination of the cases of over 300 children filed in 2014-2015 in England and Wales.

Also there is a wide variation between courts in cases that conclude before the final hearing, indicating that the court culture is more focused on settlement in some areas than others.
Courts are less reliant on appointing experts to conduct assessment during proceedings than they were before restrictions on appointing experts were imposed. Experts were appointed in a small majority of cases overall but there was wide variation between courts in the appointment of experts,
The reforms to care proceedings have also resulted in substantial changes to the orders granted, with a substantial decline in the making of placement orders and an increase in supervision orders and special guardianship orders with supervision orders. This change cannot be isolated from other changes in the courts, particularly the more negative approach to adoption since the decisions in Re B (2013) and Re B-S (2013) but it should be noted that the law has not changed in terms of the requirements for making orders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings should contribute to better understanding of the use of court resources; judicial training and children's services department policy and planning in relation to the use of supervision orders; the assessment of kin carers during care proceedings; and social work education.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E2C72C8F-1ABD-4E0C-8CB1-E252D03322C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d700994860b8.68835425</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed176043</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultant to Nuffield Foundation Funded Project Scoping a Family Justice Observatory</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7AD239DE-03CC-4803-B3E1-993F2047AF27</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b5ac19e9f057.92448506</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/towards-family-justice-observatory</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Family Justice Council Committee examining mediation in child care practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A25FF5B1-76F8-4E11-9A72-CD88389A230A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b5ab3116f804.54987430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>83466439-032B-45A0-8D31-37F5235C06F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>How is the PLO working?
