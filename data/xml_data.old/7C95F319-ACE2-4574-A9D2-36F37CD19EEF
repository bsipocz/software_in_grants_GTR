Although Bluetooth and wired hand-free kits are popular, a vast majority of voice calls are made with the phone held at the side of the head by the hand. The maximum levels of radio frequency radiation transmitted from mobile phones are carefully regulated because some of that energy is absorbed in the body, mainly in the head and hand. Mobile phones are tested to strict standards to ensure the radiation absorbed in the head is below international guidelines. Although the hand plays an important role in most real-life voice calls, the testing procedures do not include the hand. This is because some researchers in the past have shown that the hand reduces the energy absorbed in the head and so excluding the hand from the measurement was thought to provide a conservative estimate. With recent developments in phone technologies such as smaller handsets, internal antennas and higher operating frequencies, researchers have shown that the hand can significantly increase the radiation into the head. However, these findings have yet to be fully investigated and understood. This research proposal will carry out a comprehensive volunteer-based investigation looking at how the hand influences the energy absorbed inside the head. By recruiting hundreds of volunteers, we will attempt to link the radiation absorbed inside the head to factors such as hand size and volume, phone grip style and finger positions, skin conductivity etc. Energy absorption rates are measured during the experiments by using a highly sophisticated model of a head that contains hundreds of miniature electrical sensors. By performing detailed statistical analysis on the gathered data, we will be able to determine what proportion of the mobile phone using public is likely to experience an increase in the energy absorbed. In parallel studies, we aim to uncover how the hand influences the battery life of mobile phones and if the radiated energy from mobile phones change due to wear and tear over time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The statistical analysis of the measured results will identify what proportion of the mobile phone using public will experience an increase in the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and what this increase is likely to be. This study has the potential to challenge and reshape existing measurement techniques for mobile phones. The results will be published in high impact journals, for example Physics in Medicine and Biology and IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, to inform the members of committees (IEEE and IEC) responsible for formulating new mobile phone SAR measurement standards. The PI will attend two major conferences, one in Europe and one in North America, to ensure his results reach the widest possible audience. With the networking opportunities this entails and the enhancement of Loughborough University's international reputation in this field, the PI will aim to gain membership of the relevant standards committees. The general public may be interested to know that there can be considerable savings in battery life to be had by simply holding their mobile phones in a different manner. They may also be interested to know what hand positions result in increased SAR inside the head. Although mobile phones have achieved a high level of penetration in the UK and abroad, there is a deep underlying suspicion of the radiation and its effects. Better engagement with the public on SAR will be achieved through mass media and web forums. Talks and demonstrations at schools, museums and science fairs will better educate children about the radiation from their mobile phones.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science and Engineering Community Fair</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>F802159B-DEBD-4ADD-95BA-519AE71406D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Loughborough University's Science and Engineering Fair held as part of the University's programme of events for National Science and Engineering Week (NSEW). The NSEW aims to celebrate science and engineering and their importance to everyday lives, giving people the chance to participate in science and engineering activities and experiments, and to engage in related discussions in their local area. This year's theme was 'Invention and Discovery' and Loughborough's events celebrated the role of scientists, engineers and inventors in creating new technologies and solving problems.

The data collection experiment was set up at the fair as a exhibition. Volunteers (both school children and adults) were recruited from event visitors to take part in the live experiments. The reasoning behind the research project was explained to each participant and in most cases there were long discussions about the workings of mobile phones, perceived dangers of mobile phones and their use by children. There was tremendous interest from the public and a large amount of data was collected.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2804675970.9759390ca5ec32</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Outreach and Recruitment Programme at Stonehill High School</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5658CD6-8E1C-40AB-90F9-5D779CA797AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interactive lectures were well received by the students who raised a large number of questions.

There was clear evidance that students were thinking more about their own mobile phones and how they use them.


The school used the visit to develop a week long activity on understanding mobile phones. Working in groups, students were required to research the topic and produce an A1 size poster explaing some aspect of mobile phones. The students then had to give an oral presentation on their key findings. Chinthana and Ian were responsible for Judging the posters and awarding prizes to the winners.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7783475106.3803910ca6276a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Student Outreach and Recruitment programme at Di Lisle College</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7B7327F-7F9C-444F-A5FE-09ED141856C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interactive lectures were well received by the students who raised a large number of questions.

Ian had the opportunity to recruit volunteers to the study, discuss our research, demonstrate energy absorption in the head measurements and inform visitors about the known and possible effects on health of using mobile phones.

Many of the attendees showed a lot of interest in the topic.

Students showed a lot of interest in the subject, and in particular the research results we had presented.

A gap of 3 to 4cm between the palm and the back of the phone has the biggest effect. In some users, the energy absorbed in the head was doubled. In rare cases, the power levels in the head exceeded those set by international standards. For a majority of cases, when the phone was held in a natural grip, the power absorbed in the head was reduced.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The material produced for this study along with the equipment purchased can be used in future public (especially children), engagement activities, such as open days, school visits.
