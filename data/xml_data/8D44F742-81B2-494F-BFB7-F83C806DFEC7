We have contributed to providing an integrated digital workflow from data capture to information visualisation.

Science-driven information systems such as our award winning UK Soil Observatory are provided to enable access to our vast corpus of data, text, images and mapping. Data access, visualisation and download systems are created for spatial, temporal and 3D information. Intuitive user interfaces are provided to enable users to interact with the data. Interoperable web services enable our data to be consumed by integrated systems in a whole systems approach to environmental research and problem solving. Legislative obligations for information delivery are met (e.g. the EU INSPIRE Directive). Open access systems are implemented (OpenGeoscience) as well as value-added commercial applications (Online shops).

With 25% of website visits being carried out from a smartphone or tablet, the Information Systems team have dedicated resources to increasing the range of data sets and services provided through our award winning mobile apps (iGeology, mySoil). Our web applications are also optimised for such devices. Increasing digital capture and ingestion of data is core to the BGS strategy. We have advanced our digital data collection system (SIGMA). Delivery and visualisation systems for information gathered in real time from sensor networks have been developed. We have created applications to harvest data directly from commercial companies such as site investigation information from the civil engineering industry. An engaged community is increasingly utilised through a range of citizen science projects to gather and validate data resources. 'Big data' mining, analysis and visualisation has been being investigated in order to obtain new intelligence from social media data and also from BGS data and application usage statistics. 

Through the adoption of semantic web technologies, canonical data representations, big data tools, scaleable computing infrastructure, brokered data processing and visualisation services, we have started building towards embedding ourselves within a global integrated, holistic environmental research and information dissemination infrastructure.

Activities follow the BGS strategy:
- develop systems to enable BGS to acquire, manage and enhance the UK geoscience knowledgebase.
- Exploit the web to make the UK geoscience knowledgebase accessible to a worldwide audience. 
- Progress data and information interoperability and semantic publishing through GeoSciML and other industry standard data exchange formats.
- provide systems that communicate BGS knowledge to decision makers e.g. via smartphones to planners. 
- utilise participative citizen science activities (GeoExposures, mySoil, myVolcano) to extend BGS data collection and validation capacity and build links with the wider geoscience community.
- Enhance external partnerships (ESSP, UK Soil Observatory) to develop integrated systems in a whole systems approach to environmental research and problem solving.

The Data Science team has sought to streamline and centralise the digital data donation into the BGS and the data centre from the previous multitude of differing routes each with varying degrees of professional accession and ingestions or underpinning funding. The adoption of a professional centralised process of guidance and engagement, accession and ingestion via a holding store to community or national databases and data stores has led to efficiencies as well as enabling us to review the best practice this workflow process should encapsulate in order to maximise future benefits from the data and minimise risk to the data centre. Critically this has enabled us to review donation terms and conditions and licensing granted to the organisation to hold, use and disseminate the data- A vitally important area for the future as we seek to disseminate and integrate the data in order to facilitate science and the communication of the data to the public at large. The work in this area had been embedded into the online data donation portal which is presently used by commercial and NERC funded grant holders in order to donate their geoscience data. A formal launch of the portal was undertaken at the ASK Network workshop in Cardiff (late 2015) and Marine Industry workshop in London (early 2016).

Management of the current data stores holding the unique and nationally important geoscience data in a range of database and data stores with comprehensive metadata to aid their discovery and use. Recent work has included the investigation and trialling of differing data architectures that may be included in the multiple architecture model needed by the data centre/BGS as data types, complexity and volumes continue to grow, the wishes of science to rapidly interact with the data and the efficient use of staff drives our ambitions for data storage and delivery.

The team consists of members of staff who hold expert data and information knowledge highly respected by the global community which has led to the engagement in a number of global expert groups such as GEO, EGU, RDA working and expert groups and the Belmont Forum. One member of the team, Helen Glaves was also awarded the Ian McHarg medal by the European Geological Union in 2016 for her contributions in the area of data and information management within the geosciences. 

&amp;quot;Data-driven geoscience&amp;quot; is a new research area for the team exploring the possibilities for deriving new geoscience from being able to analyse, mine or interrogate the wide breadth of the data held within the organisation. Given the wide variety of data, including types, complexity and age of the data from a long-established organisation this is a challenge and is necessitating us in gaining new skills as well as the adoption of new technology and tools.

The network of contacts, external respect held within the community within the Informatics Directorate has led to our participation in four high profile Horizon 2020 projects which are all four year programmes that started in 2015/6. The collaborations will form the springboard to bringing a range of next generation Informatics skillsets as well as familiarity and access to UK and EU scale computing, storage and visualisation facilities for BGS staff. 

The National Geological Repository (NGR) manages the &amp;quot;born-analogue&amp;quot; information within the BGS, and the increasing proportion of digital surrogates, including items traditionally managed by records, geological materials collections, archives and the library. &amp;quot;Information&amp;quot; types range from borehole cores to type fossil specimens, field notebooks to borehole logs, and library books and periodicals to maps and microfossils. Sources include:
? current and past outputs of the BGS
? hydrocarbons core, samples and data supplied to DECC and held by BGS
? analogue data resulting from NERC projects
? analogue data donated by numerous commercial and academic organisations, and individual UK researchers
The DECC onshore UK and UKCS hydrocarbon well cores, samples and data are regularly consulted by oil and gas company geologists. The information collected helps reduce risk and therefore cost, and hence assists in the exploitation of the UK's energy reserves, protecting jobs, the UK current account and the economy as a whole. The BGS core store was specifically mentioned in the BIS (Nov 2014) &amp;quot;Our Plan for Growth: Science and Innovation&amp;quot; as a good example of a facility used by commercial and academic geologists. Its estimated commercial income for 2015-16 is &amp;pound;94k, (down from over &amp;pound;195k in 2013-14 when oil prices and therefore exploration were significantly higher). The facility also provided &amp;quot;in-kind&amp;quot; support to the academic community of &amp;pound;146k.
The provision of a comprehensive set (&amp;gt; 130k) of high resolution online images of UKCS hydrocarbon well core has become a key resource used by most, if not all, UKCS operators. It has contributed to the improved efficiency of the geologists, and also more focussed work within the core store. 
Other online digital surrogates include 3d digital models of type fossils, high resolution images of petrological thin sections, and scans of borehole logs. These, together with the main online databases, which provide discovery level information about many NGR items, are generally considered to be at the forefront of good practice. An estimated 2.5m borehole log scans are currently downloaded annually, mostly by the construction industry, where they form a requirement under BS5930 for geotechnical desk studies. This is a major contribution to the UK construction industry.
The NGR provides access to information otherwise unobtainable, through cost, access or uniqueness, and it underpins a long history of cooperation between BGS, academia and industry.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4E7CDE00-88CD-47BF-8457-EF0697C3FA73</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c73721851860.87066222</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Information Systems team have developed web applications, smartphone apps, data portals and interoperable web services that enable BGS to collect, ingest, manage, visualise and deliver BGS and NERC geoscience data and information.
