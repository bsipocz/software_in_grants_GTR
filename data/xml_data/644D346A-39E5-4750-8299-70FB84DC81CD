Enterprise</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006789/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Millions engage in creative hobbies each year, activities that are undertaken voluntarily for pleasure and involve high levels of ingenuity, competence and creativity. The value of hobbies for any project exploring a method and a methodology for co-created community research is that they represent an important area of community assets and strengths. The skills, knowledge, expertise and capabilities, if recognized at all, are often dismissed and devalued even by those who practice them, but they might be developed and applied more widely through volunteering, training, community activism, small business or social enterprise. 

'CARE' brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers: academics working on participatory practice and co-design, and a community co-researcher with long experience of collaborative work with community groups, to develop a methodology for co-produced community learning and skill-sharing through hobbycrafts that promotes self-reflection and reflexivity. It aims to develop a methodology that grows from the grass roots, from within communities. A focus on handicrafts and to a lesser extent collecting, the purest form of hobby activities according to the hobbies historian Steven Gelber, offers opportunities for an integrated participatory methodology that could be up-scaled and applied to other 'communities of interest', eg. sports clubs, business groups, ecological societies, performers, dance enthusiasts, gardeners (Wenger 2002). The making involved in hobby crafts has particular qualities. While small group settings foster dialogue, the experience of making, whether drawing, construction, knitting or sewing, brings something more and can enhance trust and focus concentration (Csikszentmihayli 1979). Making, moreover, is connected with narration. There is a long history of women talking while they make, exchanging confidences and telling their life histories in sewing groups and quilting bees; the artist Suzanne Lacy's socially purposeful project The Crystal Quilt (1987. Tate 2012) reveals this as it gives voice and visibility to older women. 

This project aims to co-create a methodology around making, narrating and sharing as a means of giving voice, and promoting self-reflection and reflexivity in ways that build on and develop community strengths, skills and creativity. Action research (Crouch &amp;amp; Pearce 2012), participatory practice (Ledwith &amp;amp; Springett 2010), visual methodologies (Rose 2007), digital storytelling (Lambert 2002), co-produced creative processes (Matarasso 1997), and making as a component of material culture and design ethnography (Miller 2008), provide a framework for thinking about the processes of making, talking, sharing and connecting that hobbycrafts involve. Film, aural recordings, digital tagging, visual storytelling, podcast, diaries, mapping and other visual and material methods will be used to promote reflexivity helping individuals to unpack the deeper meanings involved in hobby crafts. Having confidence in one's own abilities is a powerful position from which to take on new skills, and a belief in the value of intergenerational skill-sharing through applied learning (learning through doing) between community participants and the project team underpins the project's co-creational ethos.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The interdisciplinary nature of the research and the involvement of a community co-researcher and stakeholder partners in key areas in the voluntary arts, age and creativity, crafts, education and health sectors, means that CARE impact will be broad ranging. The research has the potential to contribute to building more resilient, healthier, active, creative and socially connected communities by:

- Increasingly the effectiveness of public policy through building the community assets of older people, in particular, as active citizens. 
- Enhancing quality of life, health, creative output and opportunities for the individuals involved in the project, and beyond to other communities that use the co-produced methodology to develop their own abilities and capacities. 
- Developing strategies and mechanisms for alternative models for learning (on and offline) through talking and making, skill-sharing and storytelling. 
- Improving the richness and diversity of the nation's cultural resources through the production of engaged community amateur creative practice.

The key to the impact of this project lies in the development of a co-created methodology for co-produced research by and with, rather than on, communities that develops from community strengths and potential, and attempts to maximise these. Immediately this generates impact within the community organizations involved in the project, particularly the community co-research partner Craftspace, providing an opportunity for them to develop their creative and reflective skills and their knowledge, while fostering strategies for community resilience. With broader application of the process, this effect can be multiplied in the UK and elsewhere; the partnership with Bealtaine Festival, for instance, offers opportunities for the co-produced project in Phase 2 to be extended to Ireland. 

Those working in community development will benefit from a methodology that not only connects people - something that has been explored more extensively - but also has potential for promoting self-reflection, reflexivity, agency and awareness, something that to date has been little researched. Community development consultant Alison Gilchrist's 'The Well-Connected Community: a networking approach to community development' (2009) is a key text in this respect; Gilchrist is contributing her expertise as a consultant on the project and will use her well-established networks to disseminate the research http://www.alisongilchrist.co.uk/

The recent Crafts Council Report 'Craft in an Age of Change' identifies a new landscape for crafts with increasing levels of redundancy and the effects of shifts in higher education as crafts courses are closed or diversify. In this context, the value of amateur skills take on new importance, particularly if people turn to craft as an alternative career. The Crafts Council is a CARE collaborator and the research findings will feed into future reports bu CC and other partner organisations such as Voluntary Arts, ConFab, and the Hertitage Crafts Association, as a wider conception of crafts practice, education, and community engagment emerges. The Craftspace Collective - community co-research partner - meanwhile, has a successful record of establishing small craft businesses and social enterprises. CARE additionally responds to Bealtaine Festival's concerns with age and creativity, and the recent European Social Survey 2008 finding that older people continue to add value to the economy, underscoring imperatives to keep active as we live longer lives. 

The Department for Communities and Local Government says it is 'working to help citizens and communities take action to solve their own problems'. CARE acknowledges this agenda and provides a grassroots model to inform how community assets can be maximised and shared, and our partners will will help us target policy makers, local authorities and third sector leaders through their websites, networks and events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99851</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This series of short films by Bryony Stokes were made in collaboration with community participants and practice-based researchers.

The curatorial director at Soho House, Rachel West and Dr Hackney will be giving a paper to academics as part of the AHRC Connected Communities Heritage Network event (January 2015). (to 100 plus academics and community heritage partners) 
Soho House were so impressed by the pieces produced by the group that they have offered free space for the group to meet regularly to develop their work, and the opportunity to sell pieces in the Museum shop. The group have also contributed to related CARE project - Craftivist Garden #wellmaking exploring wellbeing through craft- facilitating a series of workshops http://projects.falmouth.ac.uk/craftivistgarden/category/sohohouse/. These are tangible outcomes that Dr Hackney and CARE partners, Craftspace and Voluntary arts will be exploring in a subsequent project bid that aims to test and extend the reach of this social/economic model of community making/engagement in collaboration FabLabs and heritage sites and museums.

This piece was also shown at the AHRC Connected Communities Cardiff Festival and was seen by an audience of academics, community groups, partners, third sector agencies and the public: approx. 1000+ Hannah Maughan attended the event, the project stand and workshops and had discussions with, for instance, representatives of the Embroiderers' Guild - particularly current debates about digital and traditional techniques, educational approaches and possibilities for further connecting/bridging the gap between traditional approaches and contemporary aesthetics and educational concepts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463a46badb972.72334596</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>cocreating care (P2) Hannah Maughan Sewing stories kit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://cocreatingcare.wordpress.com/ethnographic-embroidery/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A digital platform (Making Things Together) designed to enable participants to engage with each other in an intimate 'buddy' relationship (a form on online crafting penfriend) communicate, show and discuss craftwork they are making and their daily crafting experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:id>65DD9BDF-4B89-40DA-9049-0FB0AE3F28C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- the Making Things Together buddy platform features in the project film made by Bryony Stokes for the AHRC Cardiff Festival https://vimeo.com/106588268 - and is available to wide audiences - it will also be available on the project website and project partner websites - and is the basis of a further collaboration and project bid with Voluntary Arts England (see collaborations section).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463995c3407c9.97181059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>cocreating care Making Things Together digital platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://cocreatingcare.wordpress.com/mtt-digital-platform/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Beyond The Toolkit: Understanding &amp;amp; Evaluating Crafts Praxis for Health and Wellbeing</gtr:description><gtr:id>09B9BE5F-5E32-4C92-AEFB-FF7EB51F3FBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition

Craftspace will additionally support the ethical dimensions of the project and help disseminate project findings through their website (and the project website) and their networks (regional, national and international). The methodology used is developed from the AHRC Co-Producing CARE project AH/K006789/1 which Prof Hackney and her team worked with Craftspace as a Community CO-I and this project takes that working relationship another step forward to test the methodology and make a follow up funding bid to test it in an international context.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>These funds refer to funds brought in for an engagement collaboration between Craftspace and Prof Hackney, and a research student at Wolverhampton University for the AHRC Utopias Festival which will take place at Somerset House London summer 2016.

Myself and my student will contribute to the project by being involved in the workshops and working with the community groups and artist to produce art works that will be displayed at the Utopian fair.

There have been a number of notable impacts from this event and from the project that led to it: 
- current project partners (Crafspace and Voluntary Arts) and new potential partners that we met at the event (Somerset Arts Workshop) are developing further funding bids (with Paul Hamlyn Trust and AHRC) to develop and build on project research (methods and outcomes) testing these out on a larger scale, with new communities groups and partners (Real Ideas Organisation - RIO, for instance).

It draws on practice-based research from a number of recently funded projects, which explore how collaborative creative practices such as hand crafts and digital activities can build assets, agency, resilience and increase wellbeing. Co-creating CARE (community asset-based research &amp;amp; enterprise), for instance, investigated how craft practices can promote community co-creation (https://cocreatingcare.wordpress.com/the-project/), while ProtoPolicy used social design tools to engage older people with future thinking and link them to local politicians (http://imagination.lancs.ac.uk/activities/ProtoPolicy). Craftivist Garden #wellMAKING explored wellbeing through crafts activism (http://projects.falmouth.ac.uk/craftivistgarden/) and Community21 developed accessible digital tools to increase citizen participation (http://community21.org/casestudies/4770_young_digital_citizens). 

The workshop is delivered in Brussels at the EU parliament as part of a 3 day event to promote and share the benefits of design for social change to EU parliament, international stakeholders and design professionals.

It aims to explore how oral history recordings might be used to create sound art events/radio programmes. Introducing participants to the rich resources, skills and support available through our partners and in collaboration with Falmouth University, the workshops also aim to involve them in 'imaginative acts'; creative ways of re-imagining how these resources might be co-created, re-purposed or re-deployed to foreground, explore, highlight or develop current community issues or concerns, such as: how to combat the numbers of shops closing in local high streets, or how important historical buildings such as the Jubilee Pool in Penzance might become more relevant for communities today. In this way the event aims to connect communities from the past with those in the present through story and voice, in order to highlight current concerns and frame future actions. 

Invited speakers on community radio, sound art, oral history and heritage, will be followed by a day of co-production workshops to explore how participants ideas might be materialised. Materials will be provided so that groups can create/edit short 3 minute podcasts, which will be broadcast/ hosted on partner platforms. They will also be archived online in the St Ives Archive's oral history collection and the project website/blog/facebook, which will serve as a resource to help groups network and support each other, work with the partner organisations and the University, and continue to make work in the future. Ideally, future work could be linked to/showcased at local community events such as the annual St Ives Festival, and/or the many other festivals and fairs that take place in Cornwall. Participants will learn new skills and gain confidence about how to engage with and share history and heritage in new ways. Oral history archives can be hard to access for non-academic audiences, and this event will encourage creative engagement with these materials in ways that give them added currency, enhancing community ownership and activities. 
The project has resulted in a number of outputs including two two-day workshops at Tate St Ives organised by Jeanie Sinclair, arts and communities officer at TSI, which attracted 50 plus schoolchildren and members of the public to each. A film was made which will be added to the project website and circulated to those who work with archives and arts organisations nationally and internationally, and to community radio stations. Professor Hackney presented a talk about the project at Lincoln University January 2016 as part of the AHRC connected communities Heritage Network - attended by 100 plus academics, community partner group representatives and research students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deda8cbfa695.81880596</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://circuit.tate.org.uk/2016/02/soundwaves-at-porthmeor-studios/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Make do and Mend' magazine article WI Life</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>946E6C9E-A77D-4F7F-9EDA-88A049F94A9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This in-depth article by Rin Hamburgh addressed questions/issues about how crafting and creative making can improve health and wellbeing.

-The build on existing Connected Communities research through a range of projects including Co-producing Care: Community Asset-Based Research &amp;amp; Enterprise (Grant ID: AH/K006789/1), which work with creative making, community heritage, archival storytelling, policy-making and design thinking.
-To explore how a network consisting of a museum, a maker space, a university and a third sector agency might work together to support community resilience, asset-building and agency, and consider how this model might be scaled up to increase impact. 
-To explore ways of engaging people aged 50+ from diverse communities with new technologies and extending the potential user-base (age/gender/skills/ethnicities) for maker-spaces. 
-To test the value of a community partner leading such projects, and explore the shared interests and mutual benefits of this approach for a practice-based, action-research model. 
-To better understand how 'learning through doing' embeds community sharing, reflection, agency and work in distinctive ways creating a new sense of connectivity, value and enterprise, particularly for those in the second half of life?


Pathways to Impact: A sharing event before the Utopia Fair will involve local community development and policy makers. The written report and digital content will be disseminated via the Crafts Council UK, local development networks, the Local Enterprise Partnership, DCMS and the national heritage alliance. During the Utopia Fair we will invite Ed Vaisey minister for culture and DCMS officials, key influencers from Whitehall concerned with localism and our contacts at the British Council to see the outputs. We will: re-create the Utopia Fair stand, display object/s, creative activity and film screening in Soho House Museum for National Heritage Week - Birmingham Heritage Open Day between 8-11 September 2016, organise and host a one day Learning Lab at Soho House Museum involving participants, partners and invited influencers, collaborate with BOM (Birmingham Open Media) to present Utopia stand content at 'Maker Monday' on the last Monday of the month and set a design challenge around the themes of Utopia for the participating maker community. Craftspace is involved in European Erasmus project exploring migrant community craft enterprise and future models for integration. We contribute a paper to the Journal of Modern Craft and apply to the RSA for a catalyst grant.

Utopian Fair: We will produce content for a stand at the Utopia Fair comprising: curated display of co-created crafted objects, graphic designed panels displayed on a simple freestanding structure showcasing the process and outcomes. We will have a film which can be screened on our stand or as part of a programme. The artists and participants will be there each day to lead a drop-in participatory activity for visitors to engage them with the content of the stand and the ideas explored. This represents a creative and cultural response to the Utopia theme. The PI, C0-I will be responsible for setting up and the stand will be staffed by them and the ECR, artists and 4 community participants.
