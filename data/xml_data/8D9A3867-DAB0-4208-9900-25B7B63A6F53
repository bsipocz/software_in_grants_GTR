Identification of the most important structural parameters is time-consuming and usually investigated by preparing many different chemical modifications of a material, determining their crystal structures, measuring their physical properties and then looking for structure-property correlations. It is also necessary to assume that the chemical modifications have no influence other than to distort the structure, which is often not the case. 
High pressure offers a way around these difficulties. Pressure can be used to distort a material without the need for chemical modification. Both crystal structures and physical property measurements can be conducted at high pressure, so that the properties of the same material can be studied in different states of distortion, providing the most direct way to study correlations between structure and properties. 
In this proposal we focus on structure-property relationships in molecule-based magnets connected into extended chains, networks or frameworks using a combination of high pressure crystallography, magnetic measurements, spectroscopy and simulation which will exploit the UK's unique capabilities in extreme conditions research. Extended materials are of great interest because a small distortion at one site is propagated throughout the material by the strong chemical links between the magnetic centres, making the magnetic properties very sensitive to structural changes. We will design and build new instruments for magnetic susceptibility and diffraction measurements at high pressure and low temperature and we will exploit these new instruments and methodology to study two important classes of magnetic material. 
1-D magnetic materials represent a fertile playground for discovering and understanding exotic physical phenomena. The magnetic behaviour of Single-Chain Magnets (SCMs) is fundamentally governed by the magnitude of nearest neighbour exchange interactions (intra-chain exchange), the extent of inter-chain interactions, and Ising-like anisotropy - all of which are sensitive to pressure. We have already shown that these parameters can be pressure-tuned in Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) and the same should be true for SCMs In 3-D frameworks magnetism can be combined with porosity, so that inclusion of different guest molecules provides another means for controlling magnetic properties. Prussian Blue Analogues consist of different metal cations linked by cyanide anions, while metal carboxylates build diamond-like frameworks. In both cases guest molecules influence magnetic ordering temperatures. Some metal-organic frameworks show spin-crossover behaviour, where different electronic configurations of the metal ions are stable under different conditions. The transition from one form to another is influenced by guest molecules which occupy the pores of the framework. High pressure will enable us to control the structure of the framework itself, the interactions between the host and the guest, and the number of guest molecules incorporated into the pores, providing a quantitative link between host-guest interactions and magnetism.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The central idea of this project is that we can understand the connection between the magnetic properties of a material and its structure by compressing or distorting geometry with high pressure and at the same time measuring how the magnetic properties change. We have recently shown that in two mononuclear Re complexes compression of intermolecular ligand-ligand contacts leads to a linear increase in the long-range magnetic ordering temperature. In one case the temperature increase by a factor of approximately four. This work has recently been the subject of a highlight on the Diamond Synchrotron web-site (see URL link below) and a talk at Diamond Light Source. The work is published in Nature Communications. 7, 13870 (2016). In work on the sodium salt of a manganese tartrate complex the effect of high pressure was focussed entirely around the sodium sites in the structure.This result opens-up a new strategy for directing the effects of compression towards specific moieties by incorporating them them in a rigid framework. This work is available in Dalton Transactions. 44, 42, p. 18324-18328 (2015). In addition to work on structure-property relationships in specific materials we have also made some key methodological advances. Many of the properties of molecular magnets are low-temperature phenomena and it is highly desirable to measure structure under the same conditions. Until now this has been extremely difficult because pressure cells are bulky devices that are hard to cool. We have developed the first 3D printed pressure cell which is small enough to be accommodated in commonly available open-flow cryostats available most crystallographic labs. The key development was to recognise that the screw-threads that connect the two halves of the pressure cell together can be idealised and miniaturised more readily using 3D printing than by conventional machining. The work is described in Review of Scientific Instruments. 88, 035103 (2017). For even lower temperatures it is now possible via our link with Newcastle University to measure high-pressure data near absolute zero. Neutron diffraction is an important method for studying molecular materials, especially in cases the H-atom positions are important or information of magnetic ordering is required. Until now neutron experiments required much larger crystals than X-ray methods. However we have shown that use of neutron Laue methods yield data suitable for fully anisotropic structure refinement, allowing joint spectroscopic and X-ray and neutron diffraction studies of exactly the same sample. The penetrating powder of neutrons also means that the pressure cell can be accommodated in a cryostat, also enabling temperatures close to absolute zero to be accessed for high pressure measurements. This work is described in IUCrJ. 3, 3, p. 168-179 and was the subject of an internship by one of our team at the ANSTO neutron facility in Sydney.

Ultra low temperature structural characterisation, coupled to high pressure environments, completed at Newcastle University was used to underpin and the characterisation of materials descried above by collaborators from Edinburgh University (grant number EP/K033646/1).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings described above have potential applications in using pressure to control of desirable physical properties and to identify the structural distortions needed to promote specific properties. We have focussed on magnetism, but the methods are applicable to any property, e.g. conductivity or spectroscopic response. We continue to make developments at central facilities that are used by numerous other groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>47D08CBE-D48E-40C6-BE68-FFFDCE602F41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e01939521e20.10502716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Science/Research/Highlights/2017/high-pressure-magnetism.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A1DA757-3FA1-4D37-97D9-867B361F7494</gtr:id><gtr:title>Locating Gases in Porous Materials: Cryogenic Loading of Fuel-Related Gases Into a Sc-based Metal-Organic Framework under Extreme Pressures.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/60623dd276e4a0845244a12a5f1bee28"><gtr:id>60623dd276e4a0845244a12a5f1bee28</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sotelo J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dee9c5704d84.08644292</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67F7AE18-BFAE-475A-96C0-46CA0A744BF9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A high-pressure crystallographic and magnetic study of Na5[Mn(l-tart)2]&amp;Acirc;&amp;middot;12H2O (l-tart = l-tartrate).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9bc53cd0efecddf91a25e78e4bbfd527"><gtr:id>9bc53cd0efecddf91a25e78e4bbfd527</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craig GA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675ec38ebf62</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A88F5482-CBA4-4F64-ABB8-A5629C7EF649</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pressure induced enhancement of the magnetic ordering temperature in rhenium(IV) monomers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/677c05b5dfe30ff57644cc218762640b"><gtr:id>677c05b5dfe30ff57644cc218762640b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodall CH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2041-1723</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a1b286f0b679.08944771</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K033549/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A097DA61-EABD-4142-9025-D4EA5CA63082</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Co-ordination Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
