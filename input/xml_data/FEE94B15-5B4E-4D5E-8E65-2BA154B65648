The starting point is the 1821 exhibition organised by Belzoni in Piccadilly, which recreated a tomb from the Valley of the Kings. The end point is the recreation of the tomb of Tutankhamen, with faked artefacts, for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924. In between these dates, the impact of Egypt on English thought and on its literature, theatre, entertainment and architecture was immense. This book will track five elements of that influence. The key research question is why British attitudes shift from treating Ancient Egyptian remains as sublime or places to express the sentiments of 'sic transit gloria mundi' ('so pass the glories of the world') towards an attitude of dread. What dominates after 1880 are stories of cursed artefacts and vengeful Arabs. This is explored in five areas.\n\nFirst, I consider 'Egyptianised London', exotic spaces constructed in London. This began with the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly but extended to the recreation of Cairo bazaars in early department stores. Dioramas of Egyptian landscapes were popular in the 1820s and 1830s, anticipating the sets in theatrical extravaganzas throughout the century. The Egyptian Court designed for the Crystal Palace was constructed around a recreation of a temple. Such structures were common in world fair sites. The erection of 'Cleopatra's Needle' on the bank of the Thames (1878) brought authenticity, and the engineering task of moving the obelisk marked shifting imperial power. The appeal of Egypt created hybrid spaces within the fabric of London.\n\nSecond, I explore the darkening attitude to Egypt through rumours of curses attached to mummies in London museums. This is often associated with the death of Carnarvon, six weeks after opening the tomb of Tutankhamen. The rumours of subsequent deaths are the subject of many popular fictions and histories. My research has followed two earlier stories of curses, including the 'Unlucky Mummy' that was gifted to the British Museum in 1889 by Douglas Murray, considered to bring misfortune on those who saw it. No one has fully researched this story, yet it is a key indicator of changing attitudes to Egypt. I also examine the curse story attached to Walter Ingram.\n\nThird, I examine how literature of the period also changed from an early use of Egypt as a romantic other-world (Gautier and Flaubert) or as a lever against modern depravity (Mary Loudon or Edgar Allen Poe). The turning point is in the late Victorian period, when Egypt is associated with the Gothic. Vengeful mummy stories appear surprisingly late in the century and often focus on London. These stories appear in the 1880s and 1890s, although the narrative structure of curses related to colonial artefacts is set in train by Lord Byron's attack on the plunder of the Parthenon Marbles. \n\nFourth, Egypt was to antiquarians and Orientalists a place of esoteric wisdom. The Hermetic tradition suggested that the bearer of this knowledge, Hermes Trismegistus, was an Egyptian priest. There was a great revival of 'Egyptian Magic' in Victorian London. Various groups of occultists set up temples, study groups and magic circles to pursue this lost wisdom, which I explore in detail. \n\nThe final context will be how the study of superstition, given scientific status by the Victorian discipline of anthropology, focused on North Africa as a particular area of primitive belief. By examing the anthropology of the 'evil eye' that emerged in the 1890s, my study concludes by investigating how this superstition was a means for articulating the growing suspicion between coloniser and colonised. London, awash with 'haunted' artefacts and mummies with blazing eyes, demonstrates how the metropolis of modernity figures its colonial debts through supernatural tales and chilling rumours.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is inevitably retrospective, but I believe I can demonstrate an impressive track record.\n\nI have published three editions of Oxford World's Classics (and am currently completing a fourth), because I am committed to disseminating my research to wide, non-academic audiences. \n\nIn the last year have given public lectures to non-academic audiences at Tate Modern, the British Film Institute, the Bishopsgate Institute, the Dana Centre of the Science Museum, Gresham College, and literary societies such as The Dracula Society. I have appeared on BBC Radio 3 and 4 over twenty times since 2006 and was a contributor to the BBC4 TV documentary, Science Fiction Britannica.\n\nOn the basis of this past record, I will be planning the following impacts related to the Egypt in London project:\n\n1 I intend to disseminate this research through museums, generating local London links to Petrie Museum and British Museum. I have already made initial contacts with the Head of Education at the British Museum. Smaller collections (such as the Cuming Museum and the Horniman Museum) and regional museums also commonly contain Egyptian artefacts (e.g. large collections in Bristol and Manchester) around which educational events happen. Through a new, highly recruiting MA in Museum Studies at Birkbeck, I hope to make successful links across the museum sector.\n\n2 The history of London draws a large local readership and audiences for public events (200 attended my recent public lecture on Gothic London at the Bishopsgate Institute, for example, and over 350 will attend the 'Bloomsbury Day' event at UCL in March 2010). My work on London literature and the Gothic has already produced contacts with the British Film Institute, where I interviewed the film-maker Patrick Keiller on stage (director of the film London). Keiller, now based at the Royal College of Art, has publicly championed my work and claimed it as an influence on his recent film installations. Another area of work focused on London's cultural history will further secure this reputation.\n\n3 Commercial exploitation through existing contacts. I will be using my contacts with BBC radio producers (I know 5 or 6 quite well) to develop two related ideas to this project, once the book has been completed: a series of short talks on the undead (vampires, zombies and mummies), and a short documentary on the history of the mummy's curse related to Thomas Douglas Murray.\n\n4 I will continue my commitment to public lecturing whenever the opportunities arise.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Talk (Petrie Museum)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E34E7C4E-1526-4607-BA27-0A48B1FA3F50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>public talk
