The quest to understand the origin and nature of the dark side of the Universe is both a central priority for astronomy research and in my view one of the main drivers of public curiosity about astronomy, and indeed about science in general. 'Exploring the dark side of the Universe' is the central theme of my proposed outreach programme. In my own experience outreach on cosmology topics is extremely popular with traditional audiences in e.g. schools, science festivals and astronomy groups. However, this proposal sets out a programme of activities aimed at bringing cosmology to a much wider demographic, in addition to these traditional audiences. I believe this approach is crucial at a time when the understanding of, and respect for, science in society as a whole is being undermined by apathy, ignorance and misrepresentation - manifest in e.g. the recent erosion of public confidence in climate change science. The cornerstone of my proposed outreach programme will be a major series of at least 50 public lectures, workshops and events on cosmological themes. These activities will be personally developed and delivered by me at venues throughout the UK between Oct 2010 and Oct 2012, building upon my substantial track record of outreach to schools, astronomy societies, museums, science centres, science festivals and the general public - and exploiting my extensive network of contacts and collaborators in education and science communication. My proposed programme of events will focus on the 'Big Questions' - areas of cosmology and astrophysics which address deep and inspiring philosophical issues: e.g. the origin and evolution of the Universe, the nature of time and space and the existence of life in the cosmos. Complementary to the extensive programme of public events, I plan to build up a comprehensive web bank of multimedia educational resources on the 'Big Question' themes in cosmology. These will be available to schools, the general public and the STFC community and thus will form a longer-term legacy from the project. The final major component of my proposed programme will aim to extend across the UK a series of 'Science Fair' projects which I ran successfully with more than 50 Scottish schools during International Year of Astronomy 2009. These Science Fair projects have been run with a range of ages, from lower primary school to early secondary, and on several broad topics - including the search for extra-terrestrial life and debunking 'Moon Hoax' conspiracy theories . The strengths of the projects include: practical engagement of pupils with the scientific method; deeper learning and understanding of key science concepts; involvement in open-ended research; interdisciplinary learning; development of strong interpersonal and communication skills and teamwork building. Above all the participants had great fun! The goal will be to extend these projects across the UK - involving STFC scientists in local support of the project work. The topic areas to be explored will also be extended to include practical challenges relevant to the 'Big Questions' in cosmology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75205</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regular visits to local schools</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:id>9D698166-E9E8-4B2A-925D-0A1B3CAE178D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a Science in Society Fellow I make regular visits to give talks and lead workshops in local high schools.

My regular invited talks to astrosocs has cemented a strong
working relationship between those socieities and the University sector. This has permitted us to coordinate public outreach activities across the country, working together with the Scottish astrosocs to deliver further schools talks and public observing events. For example more than 50 such events were coordinated for International Year of Astronomy, as part of the Scottish Solar System project (www.scottishsolarsystem.org.uk) and more than 15 similar
events were delivered by Scottish astrosocs in conjunction with the BBC Stargazing LIVE programme in Jan 2011.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>50f325ff79b9a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public_other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010,2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lectures at science centres and science festivals</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>535DDF6D-DDD1-4A71-A054-E50BB6804A8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture at Gravity Discovery Centre and SciTech, Perth WA (Oct 2010, audience 150); public lecture at Trinity College Dublin for Science Week Ireland (Nov 2010, audience 120); public lecture at Galloway Dark Sky Park (Nov 2010, audience 20); public lecture at Royal Observatory Edinburgh (Jan 2011, audience 130); public lecture at University of the Western Cape, South Africa (Jan 2011, audience 100); public lecture at Nottingham Trent University (Mar 2011, audience 120); public lecture at Whitelee Wind Farm (Mar 2011, audience 50)
