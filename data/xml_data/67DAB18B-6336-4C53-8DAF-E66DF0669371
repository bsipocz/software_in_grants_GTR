It will both focus on his day-to-day diplomatic duties and draw out the significance of these for the broader study of international history. Combining in-depth historical research with a grasp of the intellectual debates in diplomatic studies, it will investigate the relevance of the resident embassy to the conduct of modern diplomacy. Whereas media coverage of the so-called 'special relationship' focuses on the high-level, personal dealings between Presidents and Prime Ministers, this project will look lower down, at the exchanges on a day-to-day, official level - the 'inner workings' of the relationship. In so doing, it touches on a wide range of topics, including political and economic issues, but also trade promotion, consular work and public relations, military and intelligence co-operation. Furthermore, in contrast to most other academic studies of ambassadorships, which tend to concentrate on bilateral political relations, this project will focus and reflect upon the ambassador's everyday work as a diplomat. It will look at how he established personal contacts with the British government, the extent to which he interacted with Parliament, the media and the general public, his promotion of friendly relations with London, his political reporting and policy advice back to his own government in Washington and his engagement with his fellow ambassadors through the diplomatic corps. But it will also look at the London embassy in general, at how it was managed by the Ambassador, the role played by key officials like the Deputy Chief of Mission, the work of State Department staff in such areas as political and economic reporting, and the significance of staff from others agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Information Agency and the defence services. In so doing, it addresses some of the major debates about embassies and ambassadors in the diplomatic studies literature, including that of the 'death of the embassy' in the twentieth century - that is, the idea that embassies and ambassadors were becoming redundant in the 1960s and 1970s due to swifter direct communications between states, the advent of jet transport and the growth of the media (which could report political events around the world 'instantly'). The research asks how important the Ambassador was compared to other methods of contact between the two governments, such as summit and foreign ministers meetings, the work of the United Kingdom's embassy in Washington and links via international organisations, like the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The proposed monograph will show that, however reduced the centrality of ambassadors to high-level discussions, they were still a vital factor in diplomatic relations at this time, not least between the major powers. As well as published works, the project will be based on archival research in the United States and United Kingdom, private papers collections, oral history projects and the remarkably full diaries left behind by David Bruce himself. Using memoirs and biographies of other ambassadors, it will draw comparisons with the work of Bruce and the London embassy, to try to ascertain how far they were unique and to what extent they fitted a pattern of experience. The project will result in a number of conference papers as well as the publication in 2014 of a 90,000-word monograph by the prestigious American publishing group, Continuum, in their 'Key Studies in Diplomacy' series, edited by Lorna Lloyd. Given the nature of the topic, the outputs will be of interest not only to a wide range of academics and students - in History, international relations and American Studies - but also to professionals in diplomacy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries are in the public sector and include policy-makers within international and national government. In particular it is likely to benefit the United States' State Department, the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and other foreign ministries and diplomatic services around the world. It will benefit them by providing a unique, in-depth analysis of how, in the recent past, one of the largest embassies in the world functioned and contributed to the smooth running of a highly important bilateral relationship, with a particular focus on the work of the ambassador himself. It will provide a judgement on the significance of the ambassador's work, and that of the embassy over which he presided, compared to other methods of communication in the bilateral relationship, such as summit meetings between Presidents and Prime Ministers, the work of the United Kingdom's embassy in Washington and contacts via international organisations like the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It will also provide a critical insight into the work of the embassy in such areas as intelligence gathering (trying to glean something of the role of the Central Intelligence Agency station and its chief), 'information' policy (looking at the United States Information Agency staff in the embassy), defence co-operation (a key component of the 'special relationship', and one that grew after 1962 because of Britain's purchase of Polaris missiles) and consular duties (a growing concern in the 1960s, as jet transport led to a growing number of international travellers). Yet, it will be a study carried out by an independent, objective expert from outside the foreign/diplomatic service. 

Other parts of the US and British government may benefit from having a study of the advantages and disadvantages of using contacts with the United States government via their embassy in London, as compared to the other methods of communication mentioned above. More broadly, it may benefit any government department or agency that has an interest in the international sphere, including, for example, intelligence, trade and defence departments. The practical impact of the project may be seen in the beneficiaries having a greater understanding of the advantages and limitations of embassies as a form of diplomatic communication; and also of whether a greater/lesser reliance should be placed on the embassy as a contact in a particular area. Anyone who reads the monograph will be able to put their own interactions into a broader perspective, through having a much fuller grasp of why embassies exist and what they do.

As explained more fully in the Pathways to Impact attachment, I will achieve the impact in a number of ways. First, the United States' embassy will be notified of the research and I will visit the embassy. Second, I will provide materials to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Third, I will advertise the existence of the project to well-established networks that link professional and academics in the field of diplomacy. Fourth, the book will be pre-advertised by the publishers, Continuum. Finally, the book will also be advertised by myself on the University of Nottingham website and via the British International History Group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62508</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>David Bruce as Ambassador to London, 1961-69</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>6412C7C8-9C6E-41CA-A5FE-FE56AE1C6372</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research paper delivered to the David Bruce Centre, Keele University.

It resulted in a 90,000 word book from Bloomsbury, New York in 2014, as well as a number of conference and seminar papers. In contrast to many other studies of embassies which concentrate on bilateral political relations and crisis management, its focus is on the ambassador's day-to-day work as a diplomat, looking at a range of activities, from embassy management to engagement with the London social scene. In illuminating the ambassadorial routine, it investigates such themes as the promotion of friendly relations, political reporting and policy advice to Washington, Bruce's involvement with embassy activity in such fields as intelligence work, media management and consular relations, and his engagement with fellow ambassadors through the 'diplomatic corps'. In doing so the study rejects the claim that the resident embassy was a 'dying' institution in the later twentieth century. It shows that, rather than threatening the existence of the embassy, such developments as the mass media, the frequent use of 'special missions' by Washington and 'summit' conferences added to the diplomat's workload. Certainly, Bruce engaged closely with the media, was present in Washington to prepare for summit meetings with British prime ministers and supported the work of special missions from Washington to London. The study also finds that Bruce was able to communicate frequently, and at a high level, with Washington, that his views were heard in the White House and that he helped preserve good Anglo-American relations, despite Britain's declining significance in world politics. Such an in-depth analysis of the Ambassador as diplomatic actor illuminates a little-studied aspect of international history and provides a foundation for comparative studies with other embassies, at different times and locations.The ambassadorship of David Bruce in London lends itself perfectly to a detailed study not only because it was of substantial duration, lasting eight years (more than twice as long as the average US posting ), but also because it is so well-documented, not least because of the detailed diary kept by Bruce himself.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By providing such a full analysis of ambassadorial work in the 1960s, this study would provide diplomatic training programmes with an ideal case study for those setting out on a diplomatic career. It will also help foreign ministries understand the potential value of individual ambassadors in the broader foreign policy making machine.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6786BA0D-06D6-47E0-9D56-B48E55E15EBE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2683517087.8875237782dc52</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4115CBF0-81C8-4C6A-A186-30CAD67AA269</gtr:id><gtr:title>David Bruce and Diplomatic Practice: An American Ambassador in London, 1961-69</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e575d987ed46e7e1d00a943b950bbf2e"><gtr:id>e575d987ed46e7e1d00a943b950bbf2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781441112019</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54193d3923a191.85160296</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF49F964-8C98-4B5E-9181-B5BCB0E673E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Britain in Global Politics Volume 2</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd9dc19f58376ec7ea99cac38db7a810"><gtr:id>dd9dc19f58376ec7ea99cac38db7a810</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780-2303-6039-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5440dedf484c75.21904893</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J006955/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6147F869-528E-4716-B75D-1EEFD77024B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>American Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
