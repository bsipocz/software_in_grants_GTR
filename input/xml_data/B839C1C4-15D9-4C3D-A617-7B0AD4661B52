The written outputs (including one book, one book chapter, two peer-reviewed articles, one professional trade press article) have been used by, eg Older Person's Commissioner for Wales (the first such Commissioner in the world), and leaders in health and social care in Wales. The research was presented as a keynote to the spring conference of the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru in April 2014. From this, two local authorities and their NHS partners have requested follow-up work to consider how their arrangements to protect older people from mistreatment, at Board level, need to be developed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>089BA004-1BFF-4837-9595-5BEEEEB1DFC2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447d4c4728ac0.12766931</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We hear more about cases of neglect or mistreatment of older people by care homes, hospitals or in their own homes. People paid to provide care and support to older people, such as social workers, nurses, doctors, care staff, are supposed to follow procedures that set out what they should do in cases like these. Some research had found that social workers and nurses were often reluctant to use these procedures. Why was this? What influences what social workers do when faced with possible abuse of an older person? What factors do they weigh up when deciding what to do ?



The purpose of this ESRC grant was to take the findings of research on this topic (completed in 2009 and funded by the research consultancy Angela Ash Associates), to policy-makers, health and care regulators, the academy, and health and social care professionals and practitioners. 



The primary research had set out to understand what constraints and dilemmas social workers faced when dealing with potential mistreatment of an older person. It found that the answer is not as straightforward as a neat set of procedures might suggest.

In this research, rather than use adult protection procedures to take action to protect an older person from mistreatment, social workers sometimes turned a 'blind eye' to poor care provided in some care homes, or to disrespectful, undignified treatment an older person may receive in hospital. Social workers and nurses talked to each other about the dismal life some older people had in one care home. They exchanged stories of care home staff swearing in front of older people, and of witnessing an older person being told to 'sit down and shut up' when they tried to attract attention. Yet none of these incidents led to the adult protection procedures being instigated. 



Social workers often saw long-standing domestic abuse between two older spouses as a matter of 'choice', not a criminal act or something requiring their intervention. One social worker remarked &amp;quot;we're not Relate counsellors. We can only do so much as social workers because it does get to that point where the only way you can solve the problem is get a divorce, and they choose to live like this in their marriage then we can't control that&amp;quot;. 



Why this reluctance to take action to protect an older person from abuse? The reasons lie in the circumstances of support and care to older people today. If social workers intervened in every situation of poor care they came across, they may not find better options. Low-level abusive 'noise' - where hospital or care home staff speak roughly to an older person, where decades of domestic abuse are viewed as 'choice' - are not challenged because alternative support services may not be there. Having a set of procedures to protect older people from mistreatment is one thing, having decent services and respectful support to older people is another.



This ESRC post-doctoral fellowship meant the findings of this research could be taken to policy-makers, professionals and to the academy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These research findings directly assist health and social care agencies and professionals, policy-makers and polticians to:

1. better understand the limits and constraints posed by rational, procedural-driven, box-ticking working practices in work to protect older people from mistreatment.

2. better understand how, and in what ways, the social and political context to professional work to protect older people from abuse directly influences, and constrains, decision-making and action taken.


 The key exploitation routes of this research have been and continue to be:

1. Directly to policy-makers, the public and politicians, through face-to-face meetings, bespoke seminars, use of varied media

2. Directly to professionals and health and social care practitioners through conferences, seminars and workplace meetings

3. Directly to the academy, through peer-reviewed journals, academic book publishing, and conferences.



Outputs from the project included: 3 published articles; 12 presentations to conferences held in the UK and Europe; a seminar presentation to national health and care regulators; consultancy to the office of the Older People's Commissioner for Wales.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8EA660D3-67F7-40BC-8570-60EF918639B1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9523272951.620884b2f297f4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>46CA3269-C807-445D-A25C-11E4CB78BE61</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethics and the Street-level Bureaucrat: Implementing Policy to Protect Elders from Abuse</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethics and Social Welfare</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bdd34988e14c6056e5da46190bee99b7"><gtr:id>bdd34988e14c6056e5da46190bee99b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ash A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9df9de40550e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A77FA359-E29E-4824-86E1-5EDBB356983F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social work with older people in Europe : diversity and change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Indian journal of gerontology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5959ee38e8073d78ffa9569138bdb22b"><gtr:id>5959ee38e8073d78ffa9569138bdb22b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Angie Ash (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3321918297cb2bcdf8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4386A0CB-0592-4F1B-A9D4-8C7CD14DFAFD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Human Rights and Social Equality Challenges for Social Work: Social Work-social Development: Volume I</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/790e125ad79daf781a452abe039df551"><gtr:id>790e125ad79daf781a452abe039df551</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hessle, Sven</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4724-1235-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-9882120303.6998583b97069a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CDAEBD94-3DC5-4843-854F-7636FBFD8F78</gtr:id><gtr:title>Safeguarding Older People from Abuse: Critical Contexts to Policy and Practice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ec53dddd57ea78e8ecbb68b07b670db0"><gtr:id>ec53dddd57ea78e8ecbb68b07b670db0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ash, Angie</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4473-0566-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_86118818373b9707bc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9C69DC0-51CF-4D65-924F-3B16BAE36DD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Cognitive Mask?
