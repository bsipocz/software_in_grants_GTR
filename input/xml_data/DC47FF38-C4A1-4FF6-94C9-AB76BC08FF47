The aim of this project is to develop a realistic model of grammatical category development by taking ideas from recent computer models that group together words at a single point in time, and building them into a model called MOSAIC that learns language more gradually. MOSAIC is a computer program that takes as input speech directed at language-learning children, and produces as output child-like utterances that get longer as the model processes more input. These utterances can therefore be compared with those of children at different points in development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The current project will involve:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>measuring differences in the productivity of different categories in transcripts of children's speech&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>building several different versions of the model that group words into categories in different ways&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>evaluating the different versions of the model by comparing their performance with respect to each other&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>looking at whether it is possible to get better results by taking account of how much information humans (and particularly young children) are able to deal with at any one time. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although inter-disciplinary in nature, the current project is primarily a piece of basic rather than applied research, and its main beneficiaries, at least in the short and medium term, will be other academics. Our impact strategy will therefore emphasise academic channels, including a dedicated website, a workshop at the University of Liverpool aimed at disseminating our preliminary results and promoting our methodological approach, conference presentations and publications, and articles in peer-reviewed journals.

We are aware, however, that the inter-disciplinary nature of our research, and the focus on language-learning children means that it is also of interest to language professionals, parents and the public at large. We will therefore keep these groups informed through press releases in newspapers, public-oriented webpages, and summaries in the Child Language Study Centre's regular newsletter. Note that the applicants already have an excellent track record of publicizing their work to the general public, and their work has been described in national and local newspapers (e.g. The Financial Times, The Liverpool Daily Post and the Nottingham Evening Post), magazines (e.g. Scientific American, New Scientist, Psychology Today), radio (e.g. Radio 4, National Public Radio) and TV (e.g. BBC1, BBC2, British Satellite News, Anglia TV). The University of Liverpool's Child Language Study Centre also has strong links to health professionals and parents in the local community, which it maintains through public-oriented webpages and a regular newsletter distributed to parents and health professionals.

Our research is also likely to have impact outside of the academic sphere, but only in the longer term, which makes it difficult to foresee the exact nature of this impact at this point in time. Given the project's emphasis on language learning, our results have the potential to influence language assessment and therapy. For example, the methods used to measure the relative productivity of different word class categories will provide a potential means of assessing progress in grammatical development in both typically developing children and children from special populations. Insights derived from studying the effects of psychological constraints on the process of distributional analysis also have the potential to inform language therapy by identifying the kind of distributional information to which human language learners are most sensitive, and hence the best way of presenting such information to language learners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321529</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9300000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Centres and Large Grants</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ES/L008955/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C60A2742-9391-4FAC-A97F-D4C7F7C6FC60</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55f7e280a68418.01509860</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although the key beneficiaries of this research are academics interested in building realistic models of language development, our work has also begun to have impact beyond the academic sphere.

First, our modelling work has been taken up by specialists in language impairment and is beginning to have an effect on the thinking of language practitioners working with children with SLI. For example, our work with MOSAIC is cited in the 2014 Second Edition of Leonard's seminal book: Children with Specific Language Impairment, and has since been used to motivate work on input sources of third person singular omission in children with Specific Language Impairment (e.g. Leonard, Fey, Deevy and Bredin-Oja, 2015). In this work, Leonard et al. explicitly argue that the identification of input effects on children's use of optional infinitive errors suggests the need for changes in the kind of treatment given to children with SLI. 

Second, our work on the development of syntactic categories has been taken up by popular science writers interested in bringing the debate about whether grammatical categories are innately-given or constructed on the basis of input-driven learning to a wider audience. For example, our 2013 paper on the development of the determiner category featured prominently in Ben Ambridge's recent Determiner Wars article on Brainblogger.com.

Finally, we have built on these developments by communicating our findings about generalization, grammatical and morphological errors, and the relation between these errors and the language to which children are exposed to speech and language therapists, early years practitioners and to parents and the general public. For example, in September 2015, Julian Pine organised a workshop in collaboration with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists which was designed to introduce language practitioners to a range of techniques for conducting more detailed assessments of children's early language; and in November 2015, Julian Pine published an article in the NurseryWorld magazine aimed at informing Nursery Workers about the significance of different kinds of errors in preschoolers language, and contributed to an event at the Manchester Museum designed to communicate state-of-the-art knowledge about language development to parents and the general public.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>03AF74CB-0085-47FB-8E43-93913BBD1D63</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54626ecbb9b3d0.53504232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to develop a mechanism for learning word class categories such as noun and verb that could mimic developmental changes in the productivity of children's spontaneous speech. In the course of the project we have achieved the following.

We have developed a measure of the relative importance of nouns and verbs in spontaneous speech samples that allows us to identify differences in the productivity of children and adult's language use and so trace developmental changes in the productivity of children's word class categories.

We have compared the two most influential computational mechanisms for learning word classes both in terms of the quality of the categories that they construct and in terms of their ability to capture the advantage that young children show for classifying nouns over verbs.

We have used the insights gained from this comparison to develop a simpler and more realistic learning mechanism. When implemented within MOSAIC (a computational model that only gradually learns to reproduce the sentences to which it has been exposed), this learning mechanism shows the same productivity advantage that young children show for nouns over verbs.

We have explored the extent to which differences between children and adults on our measure of the relative productivity of nouns and verbs can be simulated by versions of MOSAIC that do and do not include the new learning mechanism. These simulations show that part of the difference can be simulated as a result of MOSAIC's tendency to build knowledge of sentences from the right edge, but that the remainder requires a mechanism that shows an early advantage for classifying nouns over verbs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The 'noun-richness' measure that we have developed is likely to be useful to child language researchers (including researchers in language disorders) who have often argued for a difference in the early productivity of nouns and verbs, but currently have no means of quantifying this difference in spontaneous speech samples.

The information we have provided about the relative merits of different computational approaches to word class acquisition is likely to be useful to cognitive scientists interested in building more realistic models of word class acquisition.

Our demonstration that building a simplified generalization mechanism into a gradual learning model allows us to capture early differences in the productivity of nouns and verbs is likely to be of interest to both child language researchers and computer modellers interested in building realistic models of language learning.

At a more strategic level, our research will help bridge the gap between child language researchers (who tend to view many existing computational models of language learning as too unrealistic to be useful) and computational modellers (who often do not know enough about the existing child language data to be able to use these data to evaluate their models). To this end, we have already held, as part of the project, a workshop on building realistic models of language learning which brought together a number of key UK and International figures in child language and computer modelling research, at which we presented some of our preliminary findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A1F40F3-E9AB-41B4-BA31-ABF2B770465E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54626f9f0ada46.41635010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>875FCBF6-E60D-4CEE-889E-96A2D4F8F904</gtr:id><gtr:title>Frequent frames, flexible frames and the noun-verb asymmetry</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b734abbdda004253bba6c1f5be36850"><gtr:id>8b734abbdda004253bba6c1f5be36850</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freudenthal, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5462654d189e61.23579376</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7C75C778-5A97-42DD-BBBD-F64DD6C3312C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulating developmental changes in noun richness through performance-limited distributional analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/99c846df3525ad574fa8cb5d74725458"><gtr:id>99c846df3525ad574fa8cb5d74725458</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freudenthal D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a71106afe828.64746891</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>730617DE-F801-4942-AC5A-31A5C8DBC662</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do young children have adult-like syntactic categories?
