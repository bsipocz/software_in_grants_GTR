This Anglo-Brazilian research project takes advantage of the complex and often spectacular legacy of architectural Modernism in both London and Sao Paulo (SP), and examines the public spaces in and around seminal examples of large scale Modernist architecture in both cities. In a social context of growing demand for greater democratic authorship and ownership of the built environment, in particular its public realm, the roles of the architect and of design need wider and deeper examination. The project will use the analysis of work from the 1960s and 70s in both cities as a way of reflecting historically on contemporary public space design, an important contribution to the current debates on 'place-making'.
The research teams from London and Sao Paulo will: 
1) investigate the role of the architect in the production of contemporary public space in Sao Paulo and London from the perspective of the architect's very different role during the period of High Modernism (1960s/70s) in both cities; 
2) examine whether there positive aspects to architectural Modernism in Sao Paulo and London that can be recovered to address the low quality of much contemporary public space in both cities, and 
3) explore possible relationships between traditional top-down design in both countries, and the growing interest in the UK in participatory approaches, within the context of the contemporary design of public spaces in both cities? Does greater democracy in the delivery of the built environment increase its quality? its popularity?
4) develop and disseminate a wider and deeper understanding of the relation between the authorship and ownership of public space, post-war and now in both cities.
CONTEXT OF THE RESEARCH: 
Brazil had a 'golden period' of Modernism, the result of a social pact between the architect and society. This period and this pact are long over, and it could be argued that England, apart from a brief interlude centred around the Festival of Britain, never enjoyed a 'golden period', resisting Modernism's often alienating expression in built form. Today there are marked similarities between the two countries: they both have world class financial capitals, London and Sao Paulo, and they both have multicultural populations. They both suffer from a wide divide between rich and poor, and from chronic housing shortages. Most importantly, their cities think about public space defensively, mirroring social segregation with spatial segregation. The desertion of crime-ridden public space in Sao Paulo and its over-surveillance in London are symptoms of urban failure unanticipated by the optimism and egalitarianism of Modernism. 
The Brazilian and UK teams will therefore select important Modernist and contemporary public space case studies in both cities to investigate the role of the architect in their production, and to discover whether useful knowledge can be transferred between cities in the interests of more 'successful' public spaces - i.e. enjoyed and frequented by the urban population as a whole.
APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS: 
Architects, urban designers, and developers will benefit from a better understanding of the design of successful public spaces, and will gain a wider perspective on alternative forms of more participatory design that shift the centrality of the designer (and the developer) to varying degrees.
Planners and city councils will gain a greater appreciation of the role of design in the creation of public spaces, and of the ways in which the designer can subvert or contribute to their success.
Academics will benefit from a cross-cultural comparison that examines the Modernist production of public space in a new way - from the point of view of the designer and design practice. They will also benefit from a view that challenges fashionable ideas about the automatic undesirability of top-down design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The cross-cultural Public Spaces and the Architect projectis targeted at many audiences beyond the academic community (see 'Academic Beneficiaries'), in the interests of an improved understanding of the role of the architect in public space design, and consequently an improvement in public space design itself. Our built environment partners are the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the professional body of the architecture profession in the UK, which oversees architectural education, lobbies for the role of architecture in the production of the built environment, and promotes architectural culture, including its history, andthe Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), and its International Development Network (IDN), which are committed to greater synergies between planning and urban design, and greater public awareness of the development of the public realm by both planners and designers. Both these bodies have a stake in the role of the architect in the built environment, and/or in the delivery of successful public spaces. They will therefore be keenly interested in a project thatchallenges the prevailing acceptance of the diminished role of the design professional in the production of public spaces, and which makes suggestions for improving the quality of public spaces by means of lessons drawn from two cultures and two time periods. There will be an immediate impact in 2017 - when the results and conclusions of the research are presented to our partners and discussed with them in terms of their contemporary application - and a long-term impact, as those to whom the research was presented disseminate it to other decision makers, in the interests of 'Enhancing quality of life, health and creative output'.

Our first UK government project partner is the British Council, which develops cultural relations in over 100 countries, working with thousands of policymakers, academics, curators and teachers in the UK and abroad to develop policy, professional standards and civil society in partner countries. For them, the primary interest in the project is in a successful cross-cultural collaboration between two HEIs, one in London and one in Sao Paulo. The means by which we collaborated, and repeatability of those means, will, if successful, influence funding policy on future collaborations, and serve as a useful template for arts and humanities research partnerships. The second is Design Council CABE, a semi-autonomous government body charged with improving the built environment and ensuring that places and communities are resilient and adaptable. They are consulted by Local Authorities across England, and by central government on developments of any size, and will welcome evidence of the role and importance of design in the delivery of public spaces.Our Brazilian government partner is the Municipal Secretariat of Culture, Department of Historical Patrimony (DPH) in Sao Paulo, for which Prof. Lef&amp;egrave;vre has worked as president of CONRESP (see CV). The Municipal Secretariat for Culture is responsible for many important Sao Paulo cultural institutions. The research will contribute to policy formation/revision on historic conservationin the city. Again, some impact will be immediate (2016/17), as the research is presented to, and discussed with, these partners, and some will be long term, as this example of collaboration is referred to later as evidence useful for funding decisions.

In addition, our Research Fellows and PhD student will benefit greatly from the project, first in terms of cross-cultural collaboration, and the negotiation and open-mindedness that requires, which translates easily into other employment sectors, and second, in terms of transferable generic skills: writing and presentation skills, mapping and data analysis skills, visualisation and communication skills. This skills impact will develop over the course of the three year project, as our Fellows and PhD student pursue the research and its dissemination</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207047</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Escola da Cidade, Sao Paulo</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9F3EFE3-3CA3-4D40-A69A-A70A553AC2EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation to fellow architects and academics at the Escola da Cidade, Sao Paulo.

The main ones are, briefly, as follows:

1. The current anxieties about the 'privatisation' of public space are misdirected: management, not ownership, is crucial for pubic access to public spaces. 

2. Ensuring that management is appropriate to the degree of access required for a public space is the responsibility of the Local Authority in London (councillors - policy/ planners - implementation), and the Mayor in Sao Paulo. It is not within the remit of the architect. 

3. In order to realise the intentions of his/her public space designs, therefore, the architect needs to mediate between the predominantly private client and the LA planner. This requires the architect and planner to speak each other's languages much more fluently, which in turn requires a reexamination of their training. 

4. Disciplinary silos in the built environment are barriers to speeding up the planning and procurement processes. Planners need a much greater training in design, and architects in the economics of development. 

5. Though one could safely discuss the role of 'the architect' in the production of public space post-war, one can no longer do so, as design roles are now much more fluid. Urban designers, landscape designers, 'public realm architects' AND architects can be commissioned to design public space, individually or in collaboration. 

6. The division of labour in the designing of public spaces has shifted from the architect designing prominent ensembles of building and public space post-war, to now, a combination of professionals doing separated parts of this. The architect is keen to safeguard, or perhaps recover, supremacy among the complex teams now put together by developers for large projects. The client, on the other hand, simply wants what works best, and may very well alters the pecking order to suit the project and the skills on offer. It may be unrealistic to see the architect as anything but a collaborator in the production of public space - rather than the leader of the process.

7. Post-war in the UK, 45% of all architects were directly employed by the state, and as such, were the state's agents in the built environment, with all that implies about scale of impact and ability to effect change. The situation today couldn't be more different, with most architects working in private practice, and the state renouncing its once assumed duty to pay for and deliver the material public realm. The architect's role post-war to be a 'guardian of the public realm' (Louis Kahn) is therefore out of reach to today's practitioners AS practitioners. However, they can - and some do - exchange their designer hat for an 'active citizen' hat, and campaign about public access to public space if they want to, but there are now two roles when once there was was one.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The most immediate impact of the research in an academic context is the counterbalance it provides to the overwhelming emphasis on the user of public spaces in the social and political sciences and urban studies. This project addresses the producers. The ways in which the researchers have gone about this methodologically are of importance, as the research seeks to provide a '3D' analysis of design objects - political/social/theoretical/ aesthetic. It also tries to create meaningful transferable knowledge out of small sample of case studies, that nevertheless typify certain spatial and social conditions. Future research, by us or by others, could develop either the content or the methodology or both. In terms of content, there has emerged a clear need to investigate: 

1. the potential for, and barriers to, a much more integrated education for professionals involved in delivering the built environment;
2. what exactly 'co-design' means within the context of citizen participation in the production of the built environment. It's clear to us that citizen 'co-design' of the project brief is fruitful, and any literal 'co-design' of the actual space itself is pointless. 
3. The revaluing of professional expertise is a large and overdue subject in its own right.
4. the role of the planner/Local Authority in the protection of public space, and how it relates to delivery on the ground by designers. 
5. the contributing factors to the successful management of privately owned public spaces. 

In a non-academic context, the investigations above have direct bearing on the deliberations about the future of built environment professionals, in particular, by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and the Architect's Registration Board (ARB). In addition, there is research to be done on barriers to more meaningful and productive collaborations between professional bodies like the RIBA and the Royal Town Planning Institute on the delivery of complex public-private partnerships for urban developments. Developers and development owners have a stake in getting the management of their public spaces right, and might contribute to academic research on this topic. They would certainly benefit from it.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE5E8BE3-797D-4058-9BB1-4178A64C974D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94a747032a2.75672329</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://psarchitect.org/texts/mediations/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A '3D' description of each of the eight public space case studies completed so far, giving the political/social/economic/planning/design information to ensure accurate analysis and cross-comparison.
