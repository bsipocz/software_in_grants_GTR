&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The enthusiastic reception for TobaccoTactics from diverse audiences - including NGO?s, the WHO and politicians - has encouraged the TCRG to develop it further. To become the &amp;quot;go-to&amp;quot; website for information on the tobacco industry, the project aims to: &lt;/p>

&lt;p>1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; make preliminary research findings publicly available in a timely manner;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; enable the systematic storage and retrieval of&amp;nbsp; preliminary research findings so they can be further analysed into traditional academic papers;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; serve as a means of disseminating published research findings to a large audience; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; compile research findings in a way that is useful to policy-makers and journalists.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This will be achieved by working with stakeholders and knowledge exchange-experts to maximise the relevance of TobaccoTactics to key users and identify the most effective ways of driving users to the site.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are now only eight World Health Organization (WHO) member states who have not signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the treaty aimed at reducing 'the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption'(38). Article 5.3 of the FCTC states: &amp;quot;In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law.&amp;quot; Parties to the FCTC agree there is a &amp;quot;fundamental and irreconcilable conflict&amp;quot; between tobacco industry interests and public health policy interests.

The research on TobaccoTactics describes tobacco industry activity, both past and present. The evidence reveals the industry's efforts to avoid or delay the regulation of tobacco via concerted efforts to influence the policy process. This occurs, via the use of third parties to make its messages more palatable(9), and via corporate social responsibility to restore its political capital(39, 40). 

In light of Article 5.3 and given evidence that such research findings have played a key role in holding the tobacco industry accountable and in contributing to policy debates, this information is of significant relevance and use to our partner organisations. Our letters of support attest to the way the research provided has already been used to inform contemporary policy debates. A recent example of our work relates to the developments around plain packaging for tobacco products. We regularly update TobaccoTactics with information on the proposed packaging policy and we share these updates with our partner organisations, as well as to responding to ad hoc requests for research information. We offer a review of the quality of the evidence used to substantiate tobacco industry arguments against plain packaging and provide information on the individuals and organisations prominent in the debate, identifying who are linked to or acting as fronts for the tobacco industry. We follow plain packaging debates in Australia and publish developments which are relevant to others considering the policy, such as the European Commission, India, France, Belgium, Iceland, Ireland and New Zealand. 

Our target audience and likely beneficiaries of our research are:
1. Partner Organisations: Cancer Research UK and Smokefree South West;
2. Other non-partner organisations: In the UK: FRESH North East, Tobacco Free Futures, Action for Smoking and Health. In Europe - Corporate Europe Observatory, Smoke-free Partnership;
3. Other non-partner health organisations; e.g. the Royal College of Physicians, Faculty of Public Health, British Medical Association;
4. Policy makers, including civil servants and politicians; 
5. NGOs; e.g. British Heart Foundation, National Heart Forum; 
6. Practitioners and health advocates; e.g. health promotion advisers, smoking cessation practitioners, trading standards and environmental health;
7. Media professionals;
8. Other academics;
9. The general public.

Our primary target audiences are in the UK, TobaccoTactics however has significant relevance to international audiences. Tobacco companies operate on a transnational scale, using similar strategies to avoid regulation, only adapting them to adjust to specific local or national circumstances. We currently exchange information with contacts in Europe and further afield in the US and Australia. The TCRG has Twitter followers from the EU, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia. One of our objectives is to expand the project to other countries, and to develop a manual for setting up TobaccoTactics wikis, coaching new teams, while sharing our knowledge on research, sourcing, ethics and legal risks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98757</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>George Monbiot cites TobaccoTactics in Guardian article (29 November 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A30FA29E-BD85-4770-A6C8-E9C5C345BDA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>George Monbiot's article in the Guardian &amp;quot;Heard a thinktank on the BBC?

We updated our stakeholder engagement plan and implemented changes suggested by our stakeholders. Since this time we have worked increasingly with ASH and promoted new research on TobaccoTactics.org via the ASH Daily News email alert which is sent to thousands of stakeholders everyday. We have also successfully applied for funding from the University of Bath's Seed Public Engagement Funding Scheme in order to update our TobaccoTactics website to make it more professional in appearance, make it compatible with mobile devices and allow pdfs of pages so that they are easier for stakeholders to print.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54579d912b9e38.32078672</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Supporters</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Action for Smoking and Health's Smoking Still Kills Conference (4 locations in 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01348648-6441-4FA7-AC92-4F0FB2FAE57F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose of the four conferences in London, Leeds, Birmingham and Bristol was to inform local and national Smokefree Action Coalition (SFAC) members and local stakeholders about ASH's new landmark report due to be published June 2015: Smoking Still Kills.

The Tobacco Control Research Group (Anna Gilmore, Andy Rowell, Rachel Rose Jackson &amp;amp; Karen Evans-Reeves) was invited to talk about the tobacco industry's influence on health policies and what has been done and what can be done in the future to tackle the industry. The talk sparked discussion about the tactics of the tobacco industry and how responsive the Government is to lobbying by the tobacco industry and its associates.


Many delegates expressed a wish to visit www.TobaccoTactics.org to acquire up to date information on tobacco industry and its activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461de6ebb8ea0.96996182</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Health professionals</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest Blog for Environmental Health News Magazine online</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>929B65F2-FFE1-431D-9605-4A8A65648E3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 22 August 2014 Karen Evans-Reeves published an invited blog piece in the Environmental Health News Online Magazine.

The purpose of the panel was to obtain smokers' attitudes and thoughts on some specific pieces of research published on the &amp;quot;TobaccoTactics&amp;quot; website (www.TobaccoTactics.org) set-up by the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath. Dr Eveline Lubbers introduced TobaccoTactics, Andy Rowell discussed the plain packaging proposals for tobacco products and Karen Evans-Reeves presented a controversial marketing campaign from the Transnational Tobacco Company, Philip Morris. Panellists were asked about their opinions on each aspect of the research and lively discussion ensued.

Our research area of tobacco and alcohol use is highly relevant to the general public and the stakeholders' panel was an excellent opportunity to communicate directly with beneficiaries of our research. 

Andy Rowell's talk on industry arguments against plain packaging proposals and the public health counter evidence gave panellists some more insight into the motivations of the tobacco industry and how it operates when threatened by regulation. By giving panellists the counter evidence to some industry arguments against plain packaging policy we felt we were able to give both sides of the argument thereby allowing panellists to make up their own mind about the credibility of tobacco company arguments. We were also able to show the panellists that although tobacco companies are not able to market their products in the UK through conventional advertising means, they are still highly active in countries without such restrictions. The feedback provided by panellists was used to improve both our work and its dissemination as outlined in our ESRC knowledge exchange opportunities grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458fa408f7ef0.58288702</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article in the Financial Times includes our research on the International Tax and Investment Centre (6 October 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8F26015-45FE-4CFD-80DC-878945D0D9E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In collaboration with international campaign group, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids we provided research information to The Financial Times on the activity of the International Tax and Investment Centre and their lobbying efforts on behalf of tobacco companies prior to the sixth Conference of the Parties meeting on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

Labour targets Crosby over lobbying:
The day following the Observer article, Public Affairs news, reported that Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: &amp;quot;This revelation leaves David Cameron and Lynton Crosby with serious questions to answer. They have clearly not been straight with people.
&amp;quot;Last summer, Cameron and Crosby led the public to believe that the Tory Election chief had never used his position to lobby the Government on cigarette packaging. But we now know that was not true and that Crosby was lobbying Ministers just days before entering Downing Street.
&amp;quot;This whole affair raises yet more doubts about David Cameron's judgement and the character of his Government. He brought a tobacco lobbyist into the heart of No10 and then failed to answer straight questions about his activities. This matter needs to be cleared up once and for all and David Cameron has serious questions to answer.&amp;quot; https://www.publicaffairsnews.com/articles/news/labour-targets-crosby-over-lobbying</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460b1a45bc130.12254187</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/06/lynton-crosby-lobbied-for-tobacco-giant-philip-morris</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>George Monbiot links to TobaccoTactics.org in article in The Guardian (17 March 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4749080-81D9-4ECB-BDF8-5D3B0462CC4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>George Monbiot hyperlinked to TobaccoTactics twice in his article in The Guardian on the 17 March 2014 (How Big Tobacco's lobbyists get what they want from the media).

The talk sparked lively conversation about the tobacco industry's use of third-parties in order to influence policy making.

The group had newly created www.TobaccoTactics.org (TT hereafter) to publish contemporary research on the tobacco industry and its allies, prior to publication in peer-reviewed academic publications, in order for the research to contribute to fast-paced tobacco control policy debates. 
Researchers were able to build their stakeholder network, exchange knowledge with stakeholders and thereby continually add new relevant and user friendly content to TT based on these exchanges.
Written feedback from stakeholders including NGOs, politicians and civil society groups shows that the research published on TT has been instrumental, particularly in the UK plain packaging policy debate. The website is now the go-to information repository used to refute tobacco industry arguments, expose third-parties working on the industry's behalf and promote tobacco control policies. 

The ESRC knowledge exchange grant was instrumental in helping the TCRG to develop TobaccoTactics as a unique knowledge exchange tool and allowed us to develop our networks of stakeholders and secure further funding for the project. TobaccoTactics has been highly commended by the World Health Organization and its Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Secretariat has advised that tobacco industry monitoring projects in the BRICS countries be modelled on TobaccoTactics.org.

The industry monitoring research for TobaccoTactics.org is currently funded by Cancer Research UK (for UK specific research) and the New Venture Fund (for research in Africa). As an RCUK funded project all impacts of TobaccoTactics as it relates to the current grant are logged under grant number A16481. We have been advised by ESRC that it is appropriate to log our impacts of our TobaccoTactics research under our current funders Cancer Research UK and so, while we recognise the importance of our previous ESRC grant to our current and future success, our current impacts will be ascribed to Cancer Research UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our website is UK/EU centric as core funding comes from Cancer Research UK, however, the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Secretariat has advised that tobacco industry monitoring projects in the BRICS countries be based on TobaccoTactics.org.

TobaccoTactics has been a valuable tool to communicate with stakeholders of our research, expand our network of contacts and build relationships with existing contacts by exchanging information with each other. Conducting research and then disseminating it via traditional academic routes and via our website TobaccoTactics.org hopefully illustrates how maximum impact of research can be achieved. 

Those working in similar fields, such as addictive behaviours, could set up a wiki as part of their research dissemination. E.g.
