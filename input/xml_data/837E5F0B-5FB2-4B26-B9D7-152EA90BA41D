consist of several small components that randomly interact with one another over space and time.
This concept arises in many fields, and paradigm examples studied in the probability, statistical physics and computer science literature include 
percolation, spin systems, and random and dynamic networks.
 
The development of rigorous statistical mechanics and its influence on modern probability theory turned into a 
remarkable success story in the second half of the last century, not only enriching both fields, 
but at the same time stimulating and establishing new connections between probability theory, complex analysis, dynamical systems etc.
Many powerful theories and 
techniques were produced on both sides, which led to deep understanding of equilibrium problems, 
in particular for systems whose local interactions at microscopic level give rise to weak ``macroscopic independence''.

In parallel, demands from theoretical computer science, combinatorics and non-equilibrium statistical physics 
offer a large class of models where local microscopic interactions either produce strong correlations at macroscopic levels, 
or generate non-equilibrium dynamics, whose behavior changes drastically in time, breaking stationarity and ergodicity. 
This prevents current methods based on ergodic theory and rigorous statistical mechanics techniques 
(e.g., energy vs. entropy, finite energy and combinatorial arguments) to be applied, and puts us in front of great challenges. 

Our overall objective is to develop mathematical techniques to analyze such important and difficult models, 
producing ground-breaking results in this area, establishing new connections with other topics, and opening up future directions of research.
In order to make progress towards this broad goal,
we will concentrate on four specific models, which are interesting in their own right, 
and exhibit important and challenging characteristics and phenomena that are common to a large class of systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For academic impact, especially the impact in the probability, mathematical physics, combinatorics and theoretical computer science communities please refer to the summary &amp;quot;academic beneficiaries&amp;quot;.

Furthermore we expect this research can be of interest to selected industrial partners, including British Telecom and Microsoft Research, Cambridge. We have already established initial contacts with those two groups in order to facilitate the communication of the results and help explore transference of knowledge.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>886922</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organization of the School and Workshop on Random Interacting Systems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2E0BDBF-30C8-4CA2-9859-A427E6AF31D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>School and workshop with two mini-courses (one on first passage percolation by Michael Damron and the other on spin and loop O(n) models by Ron Peled), several invited lectures by leading researchers and several contributed talks by PhD students and post-docs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b94979999c22.78737014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://people.bath.ac.uk/ados20/ris2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organization of the workshop on Random Processes in Discrete Structures</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D28FF2FE-35F9-4954-B033-0891CAE527D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop containing several invited talks by leading researchers in the intersection of probability, combinatorics and theoretical computer science, and selected invited talks by UK PhD students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b94b1455ec92.46782655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/crism/workshops/randomprocesses</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) Activated Random Walks (a mathematical model introduced in the physics literature). We developed a new proof technique (called weak stabilization) that allowed us to study the phase transitions in this model. In particular, we derived several results, and gave the first proof that the model undergoes a phase transition for any value of the so-called sleeping rate on some types of graph, giving the first partial answer for this major open problem.

2) Multi-particle diffusion limited aggregation (MDLA). For this mathematical model for dielectric breakdown, we undertook the first analysis of the process in dimensions bigger than 1. In particular, we showed that when the density of particles is large enough, then the aggregate grows with positive speed. In this project, we introduced a new process (which we call First Passage Percolation in a Hostile Environment) and analyze it. This process has mathematical interest on its own right.

3) Particle systems based on Poisson clouds of random walks. We developed a general framework (based on what we call a Two-sided Lipschitz Surface) that can be used to show space-time percolation of any increasing event. This framework can be used to proof several results in this model.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) The technique of weak stabilization seems powerful and can be adapted to solve problems in similar models.

2) The First Passage Percolation in Hostile Environment can be seem as a model of competition between two types of particles. We believe that our proof technique can be used to analyze other models of competition.

3) The two-sided Lipschitz surface is a quite general framework, and can be used to answer several questions in this model. In particular, it can be used to analyze algorithms on mobile networks.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB0C9DD4-FDC0-440F-A25E-DBB6FDF57851</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b94fbb694ba0.68192873</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08E04EB3-2606-48F5-BFE6-665B4672F385</gtr:id><gtr:title>Scaling limit of the odometer in divisible sandpiles</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Probability Theory and Related Fields</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae03b4213b5993d6847e1f0297848852"><gtr:id>ae03b4213b5993d6847e1f0297848852</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cipriani A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a352bee831df9.82517717</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1323CE8C-6966-4965-8660-9231A2661F58</gtr:id><gtr:title>The divisible sandpile with heavy-tailed variables</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Stochastic Processes and their Applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae03b4213b5993d6847e1f0297848852"><gtr:id>ae03b4213b5993d6847e1f0297848852</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cipriani A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a352b467e4664.25488563</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N004566/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
