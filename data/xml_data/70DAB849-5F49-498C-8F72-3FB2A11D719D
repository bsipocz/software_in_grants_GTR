A collaboration with the Music Academic Unit provided the data to demonstrate the accuracy of the technique and a platform for a communication campaign to promote the technology and attract potential collaborators. A high-profile event was organised in London in March 2012 that revealed the impact of the technique to a new audience. This patented technology will also be showcased at the forthcoming Farnborough Air Show and be offered as a licensing opportunity to the Aerospace industry for its application in screen displays. Recognising knowledge transfer can be a long process, the funding provided has accelerated the process of qualification and de-risking the opportunities arising from EPSRC-funded research. Funding for on-going commercialisation for these and other projects is drawn from the EPSRC Additional Sponsorship fund (EP/J501530/1).

The HAWK (Hand &amp;amp; Wrist Kinematic Measurement) technology has a range of market applications spanning from plane display screens, rehabilitation therapies and enhancing sporting performance to correcting piano playing techniques to reduce the risk of injur</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8841771873.4981232b8c2f88</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/healthsciences/business_partnership/services/hawk.page</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ocean and Earth Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:id>E1B500CA-FFA5-4180-BA05-2C6EC9844469</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The National Oceanography Centre on the Waterfront Campus is a research centre of excellence for ocean and climate research. Our scientists and engineers carry out the research, sail the ships and build the innovative machines that help improve understanding of the oceans' role in climate change. They use sophisticated tools and techniques to monitor and predict global sea level, understand how waves and currents work, discover new species of marine life, and film astonishing deep-sea features such as underwater volcanoes. Visitors to Ocean and Earth Day were afforded the chance to go aboard a working research vessel, remotely operate an underwater vehicle, visit the aquarium, take a closer look at fossils and sealife and listen to fascinating and informative talks by high profile scientists. Many of the activities were interactive and hands-on, again suitable for people of all ages. Again this event contributed to the University's record visitor numbers, a clear testament to the impact of this grant funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5246196291.63872050bf94e78</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/news/2012/03/20_record_attendance_at_ocean_and_earth_day_2012.page</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science and Engineering Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:id>47EBEDCE-76F7-4648-B08C-EF1A14B80B54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of Science and Engineering Day, there were a total of sixty activities and four shows, including the popular 'murder-mystery' science trail in which members of the public sign up to solve a fictitious crime, completing a case-book of clues by visiting research labs and facilities across the Highfield campus. The trail is framed by actors from the Nuffield Theatre who set the scene in an enjoyable and light-hearted fashion. Each member of the public is then likely to conduct between 6 and 8 small experiments based on current EPSRC and other Research Council funded research in order to complete their casebook and report back to a staged 'debrief'. This event is highly-rated in feedback, a typical comment being that 'this access to facilities allows people to get a much better understanding of what science and engineering research actually involves on a day-to-day basis'. Another highlight of the day was the Bloodhound supersonic car presented by a team of student ambassadors which proved extremely popular with visitors of all ages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9118301653.4133830bf9510c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fkx6paLpfY</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National Science and Engineering Week</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>C6F77A68-A9C2-4F59-B3BC-D4C8328DB899</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In order to raise the profile of our EPSRC funded research the University focused the majority of the funding in this category on enhancing the activities undertaken during the National Science and Engineering week, which was held in March 2012. This is an annual event run by the British Science Association designed to demonstrate &amp;quot;how the sciences and engineering relate to our everyday lives and helps to inspire the next generation of scientists with fun and participative activities&amp;quot;.1 This event has significant reach and importance, engaging members of the public and providing exciting and innovative events to explain and publicise the benefits of UK funded research. Through this high-profile event, the University aims to:

_ highlight the importance of Science, Engineering and related subjects;

_ encourage young people to continue the study of STEM subjects;

_ promote the excellent and varied research undertaken at the University;

_ showcase the University campus and its research facilities.

Building on success from previous years, the University invested heavily in new marketing media to widen the reach and heighten the impact of its world-leading research. The University ran public events, offering facility 'taster' events for the public, and high profile speakers giving inspirational talks to invited school age students. The funding enabled the University to extend the scope, impact and legacy of Science Week by increasing the venue capacity and the visitor numbers. This year the event had an Olympian flavour, showcasing the University's involvement in sport and engaging some of the more recent sporting stars who have links with Southampton to act as role models to inspire the next generation of students. The legendary cyclist Chris Boardman attracted a large audience when he delivered the University's Science Week closing address.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1909693844.53230880bf954ea</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2012/mar/12_38.shtml</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multidisciplinary Research Week</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>94187054-EE14-4EB6-A78A-E490E99EEFF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Another highlight was the Multidisciplinary Research Week that showcased the breadth and depth of the University multidisciplinary research in a one-week programme of events in February 2012 (http://www.southampton.ac.uk/documents/multidisciplinary_res_week_programme.pdf). This annual event comprises a programme of activities aimed at showcasing to large internal and external audiences, the many aspects of the University's multidisciplinary work.Keynote talks were arranged including Dr Peter White (Director of Sustainable Consumption at Procter &amp;amp; Gamble) who explored the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development for a large corporate and Dr Lucy Blue who made a compelling presentation on the inherent multidisciplinary nature of maritime archaeology combining methodologies from oceanography, geography, engineering and ethnography. Visitors also enjoyed tours of the University's state-of-the-art facilities such as the _-vis laboratory which provides 3D imaging benefits to engineering, biomedical, humanities and environmental applications. The University also ran a number of workshops, talks and discussion forums which were aimed at increasing ECR involvement in multidisciplinary research. It is clear that multidisciplinary research projects present particular challenges in enabling the collaboration of individuals with widely varying backgrounds and interests. The workshop and discussion forum sessions were aimed at assisting ECRs interested in multidisciplinary research to bridge across disciplines and develop new contacts, ideas and a common language for future research projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9037560037.3722250bf94bbc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/documents/multidisciplinary_res_week_programme.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The University of Southampton was awarded &amp;pound;164,320 through the EPSRC 2010 Unspent Balance grant award (EP/J013684/1) to use on activities that support the strategic goals of EPSRC as well as those of the University.
