The UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is responsible for policy on the natural environment, marine and fisheries, food and farming, animal and plant health, and rural communities. The broad remit of Defra means their evidence needs are substantial and cross multiple disciplines. Strong links between government and the wider research community are therefore particularly important for improving the access and use of evidence in policy development and evaluation. 

The Defra Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) and strategic evidence and analysis teams are responsible for Defra's approach to the acquisition and use of evidence to inform strategy, policy and operational delivery. The fellowship will work with Defra's CSA to promote knowledge exchange between academic organisations and Defra to provide research-informed evidence to develop and review policy. 

The aims of the fellowship are to: i) Help drive improvements in the evidence base and its use in Defra by providing high-quality, strategic analyses of challenging science-policy issues; ii) Work with the CSA and Defra evidence teams to support the development of Evidence Statements for science-policy issues; iii) Support the development of other innovative approaches to the management and use of evidence in Defra as it develops the Evidence Investment Strategy; iv) Provide the CSA and Defra with assessments of emerging scientific issues of importance to Defra's remit; v) Act as a conduit between Defra evidence teams and the wider academic community, and facilitate new links and networks.

The outcome of the fellowship is improved use of evidence for policy decisions. Specifically, the outcomes and impacts of the fellowship are: i) A series of assessments of high-profile science policy issues to support the CSA in improving the use of science and evidence in Defra; ii) The development of Evidence Statements in partnership with Defra evidence teams to enable policymakers to benefit from the widest and most comprehensive evidence base; iii) The development of innovative mechanisms for the management and use of evidence in Defra, including arrangements for working with external experts; iv) New and strengthened links between Defra and the wider research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reviewing and Communicating Evidence Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E1432626-2E3C-430C-A73A-AD1DA1B5050E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar to UK Government Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) on best practice in reviewing and communicating evidence. Policy makers need reliable information in order to develop evidence-based policies. The volume of information generated on environment, food and rural issues is vast, making it difficult for policy makers to efficiently integrate information for rational decision making. Reviewing evidence reduces information into manageable nuggets, separating insignificant, unsound or redundant information from the salient. Common methods of reviewing information (e.g. literature review and expert opinion) are useful but may not detect all information required for rational decision making. There are methods available that can increase the credibility and transparency of evidence review findings. The aim of the talk was to: i) Outline the principles of systematic methods for reviewing evidence, ii) Discuss the strengths and limitations of the difference evidence reviewing methods available, iii) Provide practical tips on how to search, appraise and summarise evidence to achieve reliable, credible and transparent findings. 

Members of policy and evidence teams attended; the presentation was distributed to evidence teams across DEFRA; several requests received for further information; and it was reported that some attendees had changed their practice to reflect some of the considerations raised in the seminar.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e00d9cb8a643.98731029</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quality Framework for Evidence Reviews Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECE86A40-3387-460D-821F-52105CC1E576</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One-day workshop on reviewing evidence for policy decision-making.

The growing scientific evidence-base on many environmental topics makes it difficult for decision-makers to synthesise evidence effectively to make informed decisions. Narrative literature reviews are predominantly used by decision-makers to summarise evidence but these types of review have a high risk of bias. My work aimed to bring evidence-based academic rigour to the synthesising of primary evidence to decision-makers through the use of systematic evidence reviews and summaries. I have developed a new method of producing short summaries of evidence for senior policy officials (Evidence Statements) using rigorous methods of secondary synthesis. As part of this work, I have produced a guidance document for Defra and accompanied guidance and advice hosted on their intranet pages. The outputs have been used to guide Defra processes of reviewing evidence for decision making, including assessing the quality of evidence and communicating uncertainty of evidence, both of which are crucial to understand for policy decisions. The guidance adopts the quality assessment tool outlined in the research publication Bilotta, Milner and Boyd (2014) developed in collaboration with G.S. Bilotta, University of Brighton, and the uncertainty assessment developed in collaboration with A.M. Collins, Imperial College London.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c4013eeef293.62224993</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CBAD1EAD-6F5F-4030-9866-A4E77C29375F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Toward pesticidovigilance.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58a6ceb998ab7daa8740c861bab57961"><gtr:id>58a6ceb998ab7daa8740c861bab57961</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0036-8075</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a957c1ec7b6c5.55918945</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>97CC6A3C-D5BF-4118-BA39-C89B7F2506FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the use of systematic reviews to inform environmental policies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Science &amp; Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698"><gtr:id>6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bilotta G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54608ce3cde967.11983189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B6B0961-8C06-4D86-8029-992507C8A3BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>How to increase the potential policy impact of environmental science research</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Sciences Europe</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698"><gtr:id>6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bilotta G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e008b830b9f4.49173277</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5C1A869D-3222-4BE1-A6BB-E4A68A9AA3F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quality assessment tools for evidence from environmental science</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Evidence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698"><gtr:id>6cf63f857f2ebc8aba36ef6eae52c698</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bilotta G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54608ce3f41076.80587066</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/L008599/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>3CE33C08-4066-4901-9973-451691879B7E</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/L008599/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>49059.47</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-11-18</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>DEC622C5-D5E8-43A8-B174-CAB7F6694D12</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/L008599/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>40081.88</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
