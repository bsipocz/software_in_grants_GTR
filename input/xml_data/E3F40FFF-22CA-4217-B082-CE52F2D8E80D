It lies at the heart of a vast range of fields in science and technology, including pharmaceuticals, healthcare, nanomaterials and foodstuffs, as well as environmental issues like weathering and carbon-capture. Only by building a fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation and growth can we hope to control these processes. Indeed, there has recently been a leap in our understanding of nucleation and growth thanks to advances in analytical techniques, which have enabled study of the nanoscale processes which govern crystallization.

We are addressing this challenge by developing strategies to design and produce crystals with defined polymorph, orientation, morphology and size. Over the last five years we have built expertise and collaborations to study crystallization using techniques such as synchrotron powder XRD, high-resolution cryo-TEM, AFM, EXAFS and the surface force apparatus. This has enabled us to show, for example, that crystallization from vapour often proceeds via liquid condensates in surface pores, which has important implications for ice formation in clouds and climate modelling. We are especially interested in bio-inspired crystallization, where the remarkable materials that are biominerals provide inspiration for the design and formation of synthetic crystals under ambient conditions. Here, we have shown that in contrast to current theories which emphasise control using biomolecules, nature uses physical confinement as a major route to controlling crystallization. We have also used bio-inspired strategies to produce &amp;quot;artificial biominerals&amp;quot; that have mechanical properties equivalent to their biogenic counterparts.

The flexible resources available within this Platform Grant will be used to underpin our existing research portfolio and to explore new ideas and approaches to understanding and controlling crystallization. Attainment of this ambitious goal requires a strategy which includes longer-term, higher-risk research. Particular emphasis will be placed on the use of the physical environment -confinement and surface topography - to control crystallization. As examples, we will extend existing projects to investigate the combined effects of confinement and surface chemistry, and to study the crystallization of amorphous minerals within carbon nanotubes. We will explore new directions including the control of protein crystallization, and microfluidic devices for the study of crystallization within droplets, with the expectation of building new research programmes based on the results.

The Platform Grant will also provide a superior research and training environment for PDRAs and students. Crystallization is a truly interdisciplinary subject, and a particular strength of our group is its ability to take both chemical and physical perspectives on the subject. This grant will hence be particularly valuable in providing a cohesive framework across the Schools of Physics and Chemistry at Leeds to help our researchers to work together as an integrated team. Staff funded by the grant will be assigned to projects rather than individual investigators, thereby enhancing the strategic nature of the platform support. Furthermore, we will provide our PDRAs with enhanced career stability and continuity, and with superior professional development opportunities to help them to apply for competitive lectureships/fellowships or positions in industry. Providing &amp;quot;added value&amp;quot;, the Platform grant will be used to initiate/ strengthen collaborations with other internationally leading groups both within and outside the UK, and the PDRAs will gain enormously from research exchanges with other labs. The flexibility of the grant ensures that we retain a critical mass of researchers in key areas (eg microfluidics, AFM) and that our large research group which is funded by many different grants remains integrated, responsive and dynamic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Platform Grant will make an impact on society, people, the economy and the knowledge base by supporting our work on crystallisation. The overarching goal of our research is to generate crystalline materials with target properties, where our strategy is based upon the development of a superior understanding of crystallization phenomena, and how they can be controlled by design. The physical and chemical properties of crystalline materials are defined by features including the polymorph, size, morphology, orientation and purity. As examples, pharmaceuticals are required as single polymorphs, while the properties of quantum dots are intimately linked to their sizes. Analysis of protein structure relies on the generation of large single crystals, while structured hydroxyapatite/ polymer composites are required for bone and dental implants. The catalytic properties of many materials can be optimised according to the exhibition of specific crystal faces, while the processing of powders depends upon their sizes and shapes. All of these can be achieved through effective control over crystal nucleation and growth processes. 

At its outset, this Platform Grant will support and develop our work on the use of physical environments - in the form of confinement and topography - to direct crystal nucleation and growth, where this topic has been identified as an area of immediate strategic need for the group. Through this strategy we will lay the groundwork for researchers to use confinement and topography to (1) generate crystals with defined polymorphs, sizes and morphologies, (2) control the location and distribution of crystals on surfaces, (3) define the orientation of crystals and (4) prevent unwanted crystallization. This approach is quite distinct from current methods which invariably rely on the surface chemistry of a substrate or additive, and thus has the potential to be transformative. As the term of the Grant progresses we will diversify the areas supported, and will bring additional resources to our work on additive-controlled crystallisation, and the formation of crystals with composite structures.

Our research therefore has the potential to make a significant impact on the huge number of academic and industrial researchers whose work requires control over crystallisation, on the wider public, and also on the UK economy, in areas ranging from healthcare to nanotechnology to everyday technologies. Links with industry will be made through existing contacts (P&amp;amp;G, Unilever and Nexia Solutions) who are all interested in the control of crystal growth on surfaces, in solution, and in microencapsulation and via the University of Leeds' industry-directed innovation hubs.

The platform grant will also have an important impact on the PDRAs it will support, as well as on our group as a whole in that it will enable new research directions to be explored, new collaborations to be initiated and existing ones to be strengthened and new skills to be acquired. There will be outstanding opportunities for professional development for all members of our group, which will enable them to move smoothly into permanent positions. We will also support the UK in generating researchers with a wide range of valuable generic and scientific skills (such as microfluidics, electron microscopy, XRD). Finally, the public will benefit through enhanced outreach work, in which the PDRAs and the whole group will participate. The visual appeal of crystals will ensure the success of such activities within schools and the wider community. Crystal growth can readily be displayed in real time to an audience with the help of microscopes and computer projection, and the investigators have experience in such outreach activities. The Leeds Centre for Crystallization will be used to offer summer placements in our university to undergraduate students and sixth-form pupils, who will be encouraged to participate via the annual &amp;quot;Leeds Festival of Science&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1408821</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We have been using microfluidic devices to study crystallization on-a-chip, and shown that we can use localised heating to induce transformation of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to single crystals of calcite. It should be possible to extend this strategy to technologically-important materials.

2. We have demonstrated that confinement can be used to promote the aragonite polymorph of calcium carbonate.

3. We have initiated new work on the crystallization of proteins on substrates patterned with topographical features, and shown that we can control the nucleation of protein crystals with appropriate topographical features.

4. We have developed a highly-reproducible strategy to occlude gold nanoparticles within single crystals of a range of materials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work will enable researchers/ scientists to use confinement to control crystallisation, where this in important to the enormous range of processes that occur in confinement. This include the formation of biomaterials and biominerals, processes such as weathering and frost-heave and the templating of nanomaterials.

Polymorph control is one of the most fascinating topics in crystallisation - and one which is still poorly understood. That confinement can control polymorph - and indeed select calcite or aragonite - gives us new understanding of the factors which govern polymorph, and can potentially answer the long-standing &amp;quot;calcite/aragonite&amp;quot; problem.

There is huge need to control protein crystallisation to generate XRD-quality crystals for structural analysis. That surface topography can potentially be used to control protein crystallisation is therefore of interest in all working in this area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FA39458D-AD6C-48EC-A08C-EDF096F7611F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bc4ac0508138.10487881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Construction,Environment,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www1.chem.leeds.ac.uk/FCM/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C70FD496-F55F-48A3-B89B-794AD560405A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Passive Picoinjection Enables Controlled Crystallization in a Droplet Microfluidic Device.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8a46f3752fd4026773cf1b531707cbf"><gtr:id>b8a46f3752fd4026773cf1b531707cbf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1613-6810</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fec71e63930.23000185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FFBE8F83-ACB0-42C8-A3CB-F9C4A708C229</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of phase separation and related topography in the exceptional ice-nucleating ability of alkali feldspars.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f907a0d8861844b21b25f20d226ac6e9"><gtr:id>f907a0d8861844b21b25f20d226ac6e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whale TF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1463-9076</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a352957a387f6.24087043</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55FEF044-AEF3-4D2E-8EC2-4B100808AC6A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using Confinement To Study the Crystallization Pathway of Calcium Carbonate</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Crystal Growth &amp;
