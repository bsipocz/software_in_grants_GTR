Although now evident in the National Lottery, Partygaming, on-line gambling and the Poker Channel on Sky, it was less overt, though probably no less endemic, in the early and mid-twentieth century, when legislation curbed much off-course 'ready-money' gambling. This research intends to examine working-class gambling in Britain, particularly between 1906 and the early 1960s. It will examine the campaigns to prohibit working-class gambling, that led to the Street Betting Act of 1906 which reaffirmed the illegality of off-course 'ready money' gambling, which was organised by the National Anti-Gambling League (NAGL) and the social investigator Seebohm Rowntree. It will also examine the ways in which attempts to prohibit both legal and illegal gambling failed and how controls began to be eased from the 1930s to the 1960s. Not least in this easing process was the Betting and Lotteries Act of 1934 which paved the way for the Labour Party, and other political parties, to start small lotteries on the football pools and to begin other gaming activities in order to pay for party agents and their political and social activities.\n In essence, then, this work centres around three central questions. First, how did working-class gambling develop and diversify between 1906 and the 1960s?. Secondly, why did many individuals and religious groups campaign to ban gambling. Thirdly, why did these campaigns fail? Many subsiduary questions arise. What. for instance, was the social cost of gambling? Why did the working classes gamble? Why did the Labour Party become increasingly concerned to legitimise gambling?\n It is generally assumed, almost undoubtedly incorrectly, that the working classes began their gambling craze in the 1870s. Whatever the timing of the events, it seems that the middle classes, encouraged by the Quakers and the nonconformist and dissenting denominations, began to lead a campaign to prohibit working-class gambling. Indeed, it was Rowntree, the social investigator and Quaker manufacturer from York, who instigated the formations of the NAGL in 1890. At first it was largely financed by Rowntree and did not develop very rapidly. However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, and as a result of a select Committee on Gambling, its pressures led to the Street Betting Act of 1906 which reaffirmed the illegality of ready-money street betting. For the next thirty years, through the Quaker 'suffering committees' and the Christian Social Council Committee on Gambling, the NAGL sought to prohibit working-class gambling.\n They were particularly concerned about the diversification of working-class gambling during the inter-war years, with the emergence of the football pools and dog racing alongside off-course gambling on the horses. However, as a result of a royal commission in 1932 and the Betting and Lotteries Act of 1934 the controls on gaming, if not necessarily gambling on the dogs, was eased and small \nlotteries and some gaming was allowed under certain conditions. This led to the decline of attempts at prohibition and the rising use of small lotteries, bingo and whist drives by many social and political groups. The Labour Party developed these activities in order to pay for some of its political activities and by the 1940s and 1950s was dependent upon then to pay for its poltical agents. Indeed, by the 1950s half the political agents in the constituencies were paid for out of receipts from gambling. This ensured that the Labour Party, along with the other political parties, changed the law in order to protect their financial interest through legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, inspiring a change of culture which saw the legitimsing of gambling and the passing of the Betting Act of 1960.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34642</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C15A76C5-96DF-45A8-8BA4-CC718BD22C50</gtr:id><gtr:title>'There Ought not to be One Law for the Rich and Another for the Poor which Is the Case To-day': The Labour Party, Lotteries, Gaming, Gambling and Bingo, c.1900-c.1960s</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e40b855eea845f2f3fae8b8bde0e89f6"><gtr:id>e40b855eea845f2f3fae8b8bde0e89f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LAYBOURN K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d067067c521bff</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D000017/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
