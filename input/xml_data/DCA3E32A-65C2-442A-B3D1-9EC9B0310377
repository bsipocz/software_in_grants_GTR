The study will examine mental health outcomes for individuals (including self-reported mental illness and death due to mental illness) and use of NHS care for mental illnesses (including hospital care, outpatient services and prescribed medicines). The study population include about 150,000 people in the Scottish Longitudinal Study and we are able to examine information collected over time for this large group, which makes the study particularly powerful. This project will analyse a new and innovative dataset made up of secondary data from several different sources which have not been combined in this way before. We have permission from the data guardians to use these data in a secure data centre, so that no identifiable information about any individual will be released. Our focus will be especially on patterns of change that we can observe for large groups of people living in different parts of Scotland. 

The public benefits of this research project will be primarily in providing evidence to inform policy makers and organizations contributing to policies for those affected by mental health issues. When our findings are approved for public release, we anticipate that public interest will focus on the following aspects of our findings:
- Relationships between local trends in employment levels during the recession, and mental health and health care outcomes for different social groups in the population. This is of relevance for policy makers in NHS Scotland, and for other agencies, such as Support in Mind, Scotland, and Centre for Welfare Reform, which are concerned to address, and advocate for the needs of those at risk of mental health problems in different parts of the country. 
- A more complete picture of mental health outcomes for populations in different types of localities, and how these change over time. These findings have potential to contribute to the design of population mental health indicators for localities, relevant for performance monitoring and needs assessment by NHS Scotland.

This research project also provides an excellent opportunity to further develop a growing collaboration between two leading research centres concerned with inequalities in health and wellbeing and how we can address these inequalities through policy and action in social and economic sectors as well as through the medical system. It also focuses specifically on one of the research priorities for ESRC relating to mental health in the population. 

As well as senior academics (Pearce, Dibben and Bambra) our multi-disciplinary team includes two 'Early Career' Academic colleagues (Cunningham, as a Co-I with expertise in application of Geographical Information Systems to explore change in social inequalities and divisions over time and Cherrie as a PDRA with postgraduate and postdoctoral experience in Environmental Epidemiology and Geography and in complex data management and analysis). 
The project will be supported by an advisory group, including Prof Sarah Curtis, Professor Emeritus, Durham University (internationally recognized for her research in health geography and has been directly involved in helping to develop this project and to prepare the linked dataset on which it will draw), Dr Mylene Riva (Associate Professor, McGill University, Canada, expert in health geography and geospatial analysis and has published research in collaboration with Prof Curtis on employment conditions and health in England), Dr Lynne Friedli (independent mental health specialist and advocate) and Dr Simon John Duffy (Director Centre for Welfare Reform), Dr Andrew Millard and Dr Stuart McTaggart, NHS Health Scotland, Frances Simpson, Chief Executive of Support in Mind Scotland.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our findings will be of interest to a range of research users including: policymakers with responsibilities in the areas of public health, health care and health inequalities; advocacy groups with concerns for mental health, welfare and local infrastructure; and beneficiaries including the wider public. Our insights into how mental health outcomes respond to large-scale shocks such economic recession and austerity measures, as well as the factors promoting resilience to such episodes, will be used to inform policy and practice debates in Scotland and beyond. 

Our ambition is to ensure that the opportunities for improving mental health and reducing inequalities are widely recognised and adopted across the areas of health, environment and social policy. This will require us to raise public awareness about the connections between economic recessions and health as well as inform policymakers across a range of sectors. Building on our existing networks, and in collaboration with our non-academic partners, we will have access to, and be able to influence, the key policy and practice arenas to ensure long-term use of our research findings. 

Our impact strategy has been developed to influence policy and practice, and challenge public assumptions about the determinants of mental health. The strategy is designed to ensure that our translation and communication plans are robust, and to make sure that we develop outputs that are of the greatest value to our intended beneficiaries and other key audiences. To assist with this, we have already involved some key beneficiaries early in our work to refine our research questions and help us develop our research design. 

Project Partners: these have been selected to ensure our findings reach the intended audiences; each of the organisations are well rehearsed in engaging with our key audiences. Our project partners are the Centre for Welfare Reform, NHS Scotland, and Support in Mind Scotland. Key representatives from these organisations have agreed to join the project Advisory Group. Their responsibilities will be advising the research team on refining the scope of the research and helping to translate the findings in order to identify opportunities for affecting policy and ensure the outputs are appropriate for the intended audiences.

Influencing decision makers: drawing on the advice of our Advisory Group we will develop a set of tailored and targeted resources for key decision makers working in the realms of health, planning and economic development. This is likely to include: 'policy briefings' (e.g. for politicians in the Scottish Government and local decision makers); talks to key groups including Cross-Party groups in the Scottish Parliament; and a stakeholder workshop for key interest groups including, but not limited to, organisations such as Greenspace Scotland and those involved with delivering the 'Place Standard' in Scotland. The invited organisations will not only be able to learn about the research findings but also contribute to developing the non-academic outputs from the research. In particular participants' advice will sought to help identify what information and in what format(s) will be of the most value to their organisations.

Influencing the public discourse: Given the public misapprehensions and stigma relating to mental health, we will look to influence public understanding of the societal drivers of mental health, as well as the ways in which the places we live, work and play can be better designed to help foster resilience to poor mental health. We will achieve this by involving a wider public at an early stage of the research and by disseminating findings at a later stage. This will be achieved in a number of ways including events at the 2017 and 2018 Edinburgh Science Festivals, blog posts on our (and other) existing blogs, through social media, and dissemination through our existing online and free webmapping tool.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P008585/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
