The research is designed to answer two crucial questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>1. How can jurors be prevented from improperly using the internet during trials? &lt;/p>

&lt;p>and&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2. How can jurors be provided with guidance that will ensure effective jury deliberations?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working exclusively with real juries at Crown Courts, this project will establish new tools to be used in jury trials to ensure proper conduct and effective deliberations. It will survey jurors to assess juror understanding of improper conduct and juror requirements for information about deliberations. Then, drawing on the survey results, it will pilot new forms of information about both improper conduct and deliberations with juries at court to identify the most effective tools. Economic costing of introducing the new tools will also be carried out and recommendations made to the judiciary and HMCTS. The research is designed to ensure that trial by jury can survive the digital age and continue to play a crucial role in a 21st century criminal justice system.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The issues addressed by this research are so fundamental to the jury system that the individuals, groups and organisations that will benefit directly from the proposed research are extensive and cover the key stakeholders in the criminal justice system, including the judiciary, Her Majesty's Courts Service, Ministry of Justice, Judicial Studies Boards, Criminal Cases Review Commission as well as members of the public who serve as jurrs or witnesses. 

This proposal has come about as a direct result of an extensive consultation process with those directly involved in the criminal justice system, initiated by Professor Thomas following the publication in February 2010 of her report Are Juries Fair?. That consultation identified the main priority area for further jury research where there was the widest agreement on the need for such research. There was unanimous agreement among the judiciary, courts and government that the priority was for research that followed up the findings in Are Juries Fair? on improper jury conduct, particularly improper juror use of the internet during trial, and on jurors' desire for more information on how to conduct deliberations. 

Policy-makers and public sector beneficiaries
The following have already been consulted and indicated that this research will be of significant benefit: 
1. Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, The Rt Hon the Lord Judge
2. Senior Presiding Judge of England and Wales, Lord Justice Goldring
3. Deputy Head of Criminal Justice, Lord Justice Thomas 
4. HHJ David Swift, Head of Criminal Sub-committee of the Council of Circuit Judges
5. Marilyn Reed and John Wright, HMCS, Senior Policy Advisors, Victim &amp;amp; Witness and Juror Branch
6. HHJ John Phillips, Director of Studies, Judicial Studies Board
7. Gillian Hawkins, Head of Better Trials Unit, Ministry of Justice
8. Jessica Haskins, Ministry of Justice, Constitution &amp;amp; Access to Justice - Analytical Services (CAJAS)
9. Serving Jurors
10. Criminal Cases Review Commission

The importance of this research and the support for it by the main stakeholders is also reflected in the fact that two key individuals representing the main stakeholders in the criminal justice system, Lord Justice Thomas (Deputy Head of Criminal Justice) and Marilyn Reed (Senior Policy Advisory HMCS Victim &amp;amp; Witness and Juror Branch), have written letters of support for the research to be submitted with this application to the ESRC

Public beneficiaries 
These include jurors, victims and witnesses in the most serious criminal trials in this country. Jurors will benefit from this research in two fundamental ways. First, they will benefit because it will lead to jurors clearly understanding what improper jury conduct is (including internet use) and how to report - and this will ensure that mistrials do not occur for these reasons and that jurors themselves do not commit the criminal offence of contempt. Victims and witnesses will also benefit, because preventing mistrials in future ensures that victims and witnesses will not be subjected to giving evidence more than once in a trial. Jurors will benefit further because they have clearly indicated that they would like more guidance on how to conduct deliberations, and this research will ensure that they receive this in the most effective way possible. 

Immediate Impact
The judiciary and HMCS have indicated that the results of this research will be put into practice in jury trials across the country immediately. This reflects the urgency of the research and the high impact the findings will have on the effective functioning of criminal trials.

International impact
Criminal courts in other jurisdictions are also facing identical problems with trying to prevent jurors from using the internet, and this research will influence policy makers responsible for criminal trials in jurisdictions such as US, Australia, Candaa and New Zealand.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88344</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inner Temple Advocacy Training Course (February 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D671B94-C1AA-477D-AAFD-52DF8A1DB551</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Generated discussion, debate and questions from trainee barristers about how to handle jury trials.

In stage 1 post verdict surveys have been carried out with real juries at Crown Courts. The information from these surveys will be used in Stages 2-4 to trial new tools with juries at court. This research project is still in progress but findings from Stage 1 indicate the following. A quarter of jurors currently do not understand the rule on internet use during trial. A small proportion of jurors are currently using the internet during trial in ways that may result in committing a contempt of court. Almost all jurors want more information about how to conduct deliberations. What jurors want deliberation information about the most is: what to do if confused about a legal issue, how to start deliberations, how to ensure a juror is not unduly pressured into reaching a verdict and what to do if something goes wrong in deliberations. Jurors also want directions from judges in writing; all jurors who received written directions from judges said they found them helpful and almsot all jurors who did not received written directions said they would have liked them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research is specifically designed to help HMCTS and the judiciary establish new tools and instructions for jurors at court to prevent jurors committing contempt of court (especially through misuse of the internet during trial) and to improve jury deliberations.
