It does so in order to understand the possibilities at such times for embedding robust, long-term responses to relevant social problems. The research focuses on the major floods which hit the UK during the winter of 2013/14, taking the Somerset Levels and Moors as a case study for examining governance processes and their outcomes in the aftermath of crises. The prolonged nature of these recent floods within Somerset has brought high levels of political, media and wider public attention. There is evidence of conflicting positions and viewpoints on the causes of the floods and the most socially, environmentally and economically appropriate response measures across various stakeholders and flood affected publics. The research will examine this dynamic and evolving context of solution and problem framing in order to build understanding of the immediate aftermath of floods as a key period in which policy change happens and particular solutions emerge. The primary objective will be to show how this initial period of response impacts on the kinds of policy solutions that are put forward and subsequently delivered over the longer term. Our research will be guided by these specific research questions: 

1) Do the periods following major national crises offer potential for initiating change in policy and response approaches to floods? 
 
2) What framings are identifiable across the wide range of actors affected by and involved with the 2013/14 floods and how are they linked to specific solutions and outcomes? 

3) Which framings dominate or become marginalised over time and with what implications for longer-term responses? 

4) How are longer-term issues such as land use, agricultural policy, climate change adaptation and sustainability, incorporated and addressed? 

The project will use innovative qualitative and quantitative methods to look in-depth at the perspectives and experiences of those that have been directly affected by flooding and those in positions of responsibility for responding and managing floods. Using repeat interviews and a locally representative survey instrument, as well as visual methodologies (i.e. photo-elicitation), the project will generate a rich data set that will be used to interrogate the important questions about governance in periods after crises that the research addresses. The lessons learned from this case study will inform the processes of policy-making as they unfold and contribute to the development of robust, long-term responses to floods that are attuned to the values, perspectives and world views of the different social actors affected.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed programme of work will create a significant body of empirical data that will allow for a triangulated analysis and synthesis across the three separate WP outputs. We envisage the conclusions informing UK policy making in two specific ways: 1) By highlighting different framings and understandings of the issues that should be considered within the flood policy decision making processes; and 2) by informing the ways that processes of flood governance engage with longer-term issues. The project has direct and long-term strategic relevance and strong potential to impact policy development both through the research itself (as indicated in the case for support) and the specific activities we propose to enhance the economic and societal impact of the research.

1) During the proposal development phase we have already worked using our existing contacts and knowledge of the governance terrain to build links with potential beneficiaries and users (e.g. Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Somerset County Council). We have developed the basis for a project Sounding Board that will be used throughout the study to facilitate the co-production of knowledge with research users where appropriate. The Board will involve ongoing interactions at key intervals during the project's development to both incorporate the knowledge and insights of users in the processes of research design and provide a basis for disseminating early findings, providing a route for direct and immediate impacts. The potential for impact will further be enhanced through the creation of deliberative fora in Work Package 3 of the project that will provide a basis for engagement and discussion amongst other stakeholders and affected publics. 

2) Valuable early intelligence is likely to be generated by this project regarding particularly sensitive issues in the ways floods are managed requiring in-depth engagement between decision makers and the lay public in the future. These outputs will be of use for stakeholders in government (e.g. DEFRA, EA), flood risk management industries (e.g. engineering firms such as ARUP), and NGOs (e.g. the National Flood Forum). All members of the team are active and engaged social scientists in the area of environmental risk that regularly provide expert advice through knowledge exchange meetings, presentations and briefings with potential beneficiaries and users. The insights generated from this project will be disseminated via these more informal routes drawing on the experience of team members. Team members will work to disseminate the research via the media, social media and their wider online presence in order to generate interest in and awareness of the ongoing work. This will be achieved through producing press releases pertaining to key events or outcomes, using our twitter accounts (our team's twitter followers number over one thousand and include influential journalists, policy audiences and academics), and writing for relevant blogs, websites and non-academic publications (e.g. Carbon Brief, the Conversation, National Flood Forum bulletin). We will also seek the support and advice of the Science Media Centre in order to hold a media briefing towards the end of the project reporting key outcomes. 

3) The research is likely to generate interest from members of the flood affected and wider public. To reach these audiences a number of key public engagement activities will be undertaken building on existing plans and funding already in place or having been applied for. For example, we plan to have a presence at the AHRC Being Human festival and the ESRC Festival of Social Science through which we would disseminate findings and insights arising from this project. Additionally, we can enhance a planned ESRC-funded event 'Seeing the Climate' (grant ES/K001175/1) by utilising the photographs that would be generated as part of this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160607</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Submerged: Portraits form the Levels is a photography exhibition created by David Mansell-Moulin in collaboration with the project team, which reflects on the research analysis. The following text describes the thoughts behind the creation of this piece.

Floods are both a private and public affair. They are debated vociferously within media and other public fora, and public institutions have responsibilities for their management. But the experience of flooding is also deeply private, bringing the destruction of our most personal artefacts, our photographs and memories, our homes, our security. These are times of heightened stress which tends to manifest in frustrated and highly charged contestation and confrontations between those affected and those in positions of authority. 

Responding to research undertaken in Somerset following the winter storms of 2013-14, this exhibition seeks to engage with the human experience of flooding. Presented in a series of large-format colour photographic portraits, it portrays those directly affected by the floods, along-side those involved with flood management and the response. The images are accompanied by quotes from the participants reflecting experiences from different perspectives. The exhibition seeks to prompt reflection on what can be learnt from these events.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5C5845E-C805-48B9-B900-2B254A0B28C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was held during the RGS (with IBG) conference, 2015.

The text below summarises the intention behind the film. 

The Somerset levels floods of 2013/14 left many people living semi-aquatic lives for months on end. Once familiar family homes were transformed and the levels became the subject of a story which drew attention from across the UK and around the world. Despite the overwhelming buzz of media attention, it was an experience that left many feeling isolated; caught in an otherworldly displaced space, where time stood still. The floods sparked great controversy about how and why they occurred and who was to blame for their scale and duration. Why 'they' let it happen and the way 'they' handled the situation became the subject of contentious debate and confrontation. THEY responds to stories collated from interviews of those affected; it reflects on the accounts people gave which brought to view a sense of forced adaptation to an otherworldly existence; on view yet disconnected from the outside world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C677AF8B-99C6-4615-A8A7-A1643D98E62D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film was screened during an evening panel event that the research team organised as part of the Royal Geographical Society annual conference with over 120 people in attendance, including academics, members of the public, research participants, and representatives from organisations including the MET office, Public Health England, Somerset County Council, the Environment Agency, Defra, the Committee on Climate Change, CIWEM, Arup, Devon Maritime Forum, RSPB, Somerset IDB.

This report sets out key insights and findings from the project, which was focused on the social and political dynamics of flood events. The research sought to understand the evolution of responses to floods in the aftermath of a major event and the implications for longer-term flood management. The project examined perceptions and experiences of members of the public affected by flooding and those with professional responsibility for flood risk management, policy, and practice ('stakeholders'). 

Current policy debates in the UK highlight distinctive challenges in responding to floods, given expectations for increases in their severity and frequency with climate change. Over five million homes and business are subject to flood risk in the UK (Environment Agency, 2014) and recent major floods in 2013/14 and 2015/16 have resulted in extensive damage to private property and public infrastructure with many millions of pounds of economic losses (e.g. Chatterton et al. 2016). Although there has been much previous research on how members of the public are affected by floods and some work to understand perceptions relating to particular dimensions of the issue (such as the link between flooding experience and climate change), we know far less about the range of perspectives on flooding across public and stakeholder groups or how these interact to affect responses and outcomes in the aftermath of major events. Greater understanding of public perceptions and experiences of floods, and how these evolve, will highlight challenges, and also present opportunities, for the delivery of UK flood policy and management strategies. 

The research involved three phases of intensive longitudinal empirical research during the year following the UK's 2013/14 flood events (June 2014-June 2015): 1) In-depth qualitative repeat interviews over a one year period with flood affected members of the public (interview n=60) in Somerset (South West England), and with key stakeholders at national and regional levels (interview n= 52); 2) A locally representative survey of 1000 members of the public across two flooded UK regions (Somerset n=500 and Boston, Lincolnshire n=500, July 2015). 3) Two deliberative workshops, one with flood affected publics and another with key stakeholders (June 2015). This report offers an overview of the key findings from these datasets relating to public and stakeholder experiences and perceptions of flooding after a major flood event. 

The research has illuminated a wide range of novel insights on public and stakeholder perceptions regarding: flood policy and public expenditure; perceptions of causes and solutions to flood risk; the underlying factors that influence people's engagement with flood risk management; alternative mechanisms for reducing the impacts of floods; processes of recovery and community resilience; health and well-being impacts associated with flooding; and the political dimensions of decision-making about responses. 

KEY FINDINGS 
The research reveals important differences in how members of the public and stakeholders understand causes and solutions for flood risk and interpret the appropriateness of responses and responsibilities. This offers new insights into the reasons for contestation following flood events and provides evidence relevant to the development of capacities for future management of flood risk. Specifically, the analysis highlights the importance of more strategic processes for decision-making post-floods in order to reduce contestation and capitalise on the opportunities that flood events present both for public engagement, and for embedding flood resilience and resistance when homes and communities are being rebuilt. The data highlights important differences across places, people, and households in terms of their experiences of flooding that have relevance for the appropriateness of advice, support, and perceptions of responses. Finally, the analysis provides novel understanding of the factors that underpin and influence community resilience in and through flood events and signals the importance of policy mechanisms that support social resilience, for future flood management. The report is structured around four themes. 3 

Perceptions of Flood Causes and Solutions 
Members of the public perceive the causes of floods differently to those in institutions and stakeholder organisations. This has important implications for perceptions of the solutions to floods and offers insights relevant to understanding why publics react in the ways that they do following flood events: 
The research highlights key differences in the ways in which members of the public and stakeholders frame the causes of flood events, which have direct implications for the perceptions of responses. Although both members of the public and stakeholders agreed that high levels of rainfall contributed to the 2013/14 winter floods, less focus was placed on weather or climate in the public responses. Instead, the public cohort more readily attributed the floods to social actions of institutions and individuals, including river and land maintenance, inappropriate development, specific decisions about water management during the flood event, and longer term prioritisation of other issues by authorities. Variations in perceptions of the causes of flooding underpinned differing views on the solutions. This was particularly noticeable in relation to emotionally charged debates about land and river management decisions. There was, however, pragmatism within the public cohort related to the availability of funding for flood risk management, and what could be realistically achieved under current economic conditions. The contrasts between public and stakeholder perspectives can be seen as central to problems of blame cultures and a diminished quality of public debate about responses to floods. Perceptions of historic flood management decisions, budgetary constraints, and the belief that climate change is utilised an excuse for inaction contribute toward mistrust in authorities and further constrain the nature of the debate. With increasing flood risk and occurrences of flooding these issues are likely to intensify in future if efforts are not made to support the development of lower cost solutions for high-risk communities that do not qualify under current economic assessments for flood defence funding. There is a need for greater dialogue about viable lower cost alternatives for flood management in order to improve the terms of public debate and reduce the tendencies for a blame culture. 

Politics, Expectations and Institutional Responses 
Differences in expectations with regards to response and recovery processes were evident across public and stakeholder cohorts. The expectations members of the public have pertain to basic underlying rights or ideals about the role that government should play in ensuring the socio-environmental conditions needed to live healthy lives: 
The data reveal a mismatch in the expectations of members of the public and the statutory requirements of government bodies with responsibilities for flood risk management. This relates to a lack of clarity about institutional responsibilities and frustrations with the responses to flood events amongst those affected. The result is reduced trust in authorities that can detrimentally impact the relief efforts and in the longer-term has consequences for how effectively communities and agencies can work together to combat future flood risk. Clear written communications that establish what support different key agencies provide for the public in case of a flood event may be beneficial in resolving some of these issues. However, there is a need for tangible responses to floods and communication about the efforts that people affected and authorities will take to diminish the impacts of future events. The ability of different agencies, people and organisations to work together across scales to create solutions was an important concern that arose out of issues public participants and stakeholders saw with current responses and longer-term flood risk management. Such issues pertained to the diminished role of local communities and local knowledge in managing flood risk within affected areas; the funding arrangements for flood management; and the environmental protection functions of the main agency with responsibilities for flood risk. The influence of politics in decision-making about flooding was identified as an issue by both stakeholders and members of the public. The poor quality of political debate and the use of flood events to advance or entrench existing political interests and concerns (e.g. relating to electoral politics and differences between party positions) were identified as strongly influencing responses and decision-making. The research shows that communities can and do initiate responses following floods, such as enabling travel, particularly to and from the workplace, in clean-up processes, and through supporting health needs. These could be better supported by governing institutions and agencies through greater sensitivity to on-going community-led responses and attentiveness to the importance of community cohesion, for example, in evacuation protocols. 

Place and Situated Responses 
Perceptions of flood risk and efforts to respond to events are influenced by range of factors that relate to the specifics of different places. These include community relationships, prior flood experience, and place attachment: 
The analysis shows how the uniqueness of particular areas and the forms of place attachment that develop are important for understanding public responses to flood risk. This pertains as much to the social and political landscape, current and historic, as the material environment. The attachments that people have to the material environment, as well as the aesthetic and cultural dimensions of the landscape, play a significant role in how people react to flood events throughout the recovery and response process, including attitudes towards building resilience for future flood events. Attachments to place can result in a desire to maintain particular forms of water and landscape and retain traditional practices for flood management. This can conflict with the need to adapt to future flood risk, which is likely to involve significant changes both materially and socially. In terms of political dimensions, public views on responses to floods are linked to perceptions about differences in the ways other areas are treated by authorities and government and this also has implications for public reactions following floods. Re-forging connections with home and place more widely is an important part of recovery processes after flood events with implications for well-being. The findings highlight the importance of being sensitive to the specificities of place in the responses to flooding. However, they also draw attention to how the differential forms of social and economic capital that communities and local authorities or agencies have, can affect their ability to attract national resources potentially leading to uneven distributions that are not necessarily reflective of need. Attention to the particular characteristics of areas, homes and people thus needs to be part of broader more strategic processes for decision-making and efforts to ensure fair and appropriate distributions of resources. 
This is suggestive of a need for a flexible approach to assessing options for flood risk management and engaging with communities across different areas. Such an approach would take account of the various place-specific issues that influence perceptions of flood risk and management options, in order to develop responses that do not conflict with existing community relationships, values, and attitudes toward the local area. 

Flood Experience, Community Resilience, and Well-being 
Social networks and community cohesion are critical in supporting resilience to flood events. The findings suggest that these aspects are currently underemphasised in emergency response and policy strategies when compared to material and infrastructural components of flood resilience: 
The research findings provide evidence for the importance of community cohesion and social networks in mitigating negative impacts to well-being during and after flood events. Several dimensions of social resilience are revealed as significant for enhancing the abilities of people to cope and for improving well-being. These include formal and informal modes of support, for example businesses offering services and donating to relief efforts, keep in touch networks, and dinner or other forms of social meetings with friends and others that have been affected. The presence of support workers and volunteers also formed an important part of the social infrastructures relevant to community resilience, for example by signposting people towards more formal types of institutional support or by providing direct personal support at times of high anxiety and stress. People having a sense of agency, including abilities to effect change and engagement with decision-making processes, is also revealed as a significant factor in improving people's well-being in post-flood contexts. Governing institutions can support multiple aspects of community resilience but can also inadvertently have detrimental impacts on community cohesion and co-operation. The analysis highlights how stress and anxiety owing to floods has wide-ranging social and economic impacts on work, future lives and livelihoods, and social participation that are not easily measureable so could be overlooked. For example, the research shows that many effects are more subtle, frequently not reported, and not characterised by post-traumatic stress disorder, so are not likely to be accounted for within current assessments of flood impacts. There is a need to find means for taking better account of these socio-economic impacts within policy and institutions. 

The project offers three overarching key recommendations: 
1. Improving the quality of the public debate in post-flood contexts: Flood events present opportunities for engagement between members of the public that have been affected by flooding and decision-makers within institutions. These are moments in which new groups and networks are formed and people seek to connect with governmental organisations. Equally, they represent times when there are high levels of institutional communication and action, though public meetings and other types of formal and informal engagement. At present, the opportunities that this might afford for more collaborative processes of response are diminished by the poor quality of political debate and public rows that surround flood events, and a lack of clarity about what people can expect in the aftermath of events from authorities or what they can do themselves. There is a need to improve the quality of the political debate in the aftermath of floods and work to ensure that expectations are negotiated between and across communities affected and institutions with responsibilities. 

2. Supporting social resilience and recognising community responses: Floods have significant negative impacts on well-being and conventional approaches to assessment and measurement pertaining to policy responses limit abilities to take account of these and to effectively respond. Given this, social and community resilience may be underestimated in terms of its role in enabling people to cope and recover from floods, and in mitigating negative implications for well-being. Greater support should be given to mechanisms and policies that aim to enhance social and community forms of resilience. Specific recommendations arising from the research include the importance of increasing the use of professionalised community coordinator roles (such as village agents in rural contexts) that can form a link and source of two-way exchange between agencies, responders, governing bodies, and communities. Individuals working in community support roles provide an important mechanism during emergency and post-flood contexts but also have roles in generating community resilience outside of these times. There is a role for institutions in ensuring social infrastructures are in place that can effectively support the emergence and maintenance of social resilience. 

3. Taking a strategic approach to financing and embedding resilience and resistance in response and recovery: Emergency funds and their allocation at times of intense pressure and stress following floods can contribute toward short-term decision-making and a lack of strategic direction. Processes for allocating funding at these times should be better formalised so that communities, local authorities, and agencies can know with greater clarity what opportunities are available for additional funding allocations following major events. This is to recognise that severe floods are likely to happen more frequently and enable a greater degree of strategic oversight in the decision-making and funding allocations that are made. Consideration should be given as to how government initiatives (such as the flood mitigation fund) could work in concert with insurance industry protocols, for example loss adjusters assessing for property level resilience and resistance measures as part of the insurance claims processes. There is a need to embed more strategic processes for decision-making about funding and resilient rebuilding in post-flood contexts to facilitate responses that will reduce the impacts of flood events in future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In our proposal we envisaged the conclusions informing policy making in two ways: 1) By highlighting different framings of the issues that should be considered within flood policy decision-making processes; 2) by informing the ways that processes of flood governance engage with longer-term issues. We have developed pathways to achieving these aims, forming good relationships with key organisations including, Somerset County Council, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency, the Committee on Climate Change, RSPB, Met Office and Public Health England. As we've developed our analysis and published our findings, we have continued to build on these relationships to create a basis for the work being taken forward and used by these groups and others. This has included ongoing meetings and attendance at events, as well as more informal communications. Additionally we held a launch event for our report with attendance from all of the major stakeholder parties with which we are engaging. 

We are continuing to collaborate with the Royal Geographical Society to develop resources for UK schools based on the research so can anticipate the findings being taken forward by informing development of the Geography curriculum. 

The findings have been put to use in feeding into the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment and into PHE recommendations regarding responses to floods. 

The findings have fed into the Royal Geographical Society's recommendations and response to the Letwin review, as well as being utilised as basis for evidence submissions to this and other reviews carried out since the 2013/14 floods. 

In terms of academic research, we have cultivated considerable interest in the results and findings including from other ESRC funded projects, such as the Children, Young People and Disasters project, and major research institutions, such as the Flood Hazard Research Centre and the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management network.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A5D30809-2CA0-4BBA-8E4B-738FEB3E6926</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55ef0f8320e963.45538955</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://geography.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/schoolofgeography/winterfloods/documents/Butler_et_al_2016_Socia_Political_DynamicsFloods.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Defra/EA/WG report Delivering Benefits through Evidence: The costs and impacts of the winter 2013 to 2014 floods</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A3B2BC0C-624C-407F-AB18-0CB1E03E0E98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c93459a99726.54975830</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-costs-and-impacts-of-the-winter-2013-to-2014-floods</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submissions to Evidence Reviews - the Letwin Review and the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs Committee on Future Flood Prevention</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD09DB8C-46FF-432C-82E1-34EA182120D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c93289ad12c7.14266951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8AD7E553-96EC-4570-8819-2B036005BE5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social and Political Dynamics of Flood Risk, Recovery and Response: A Report on the Findings of the Winter Floods Project</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08c0f6fe6fd536d0524ce94c10256a2c"><gtr:id>08c0f6fe6fd536d0524ce94c10256a2c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Butler C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-902746-35-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>576949687b91e3.39291236</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F4D5654-F234-499A-B3CD-C36E3568831C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Place, well-being, and fairness shape priorities for adaptation to climate change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Global Environmental Change</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4cf1675d4a66f1d74eb093849d2e1e4"><gtr:id>d4cf1675d4a66f1d74eb093849d2e1e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adger W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>57694856c7a632.78649385</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57646283-8F71-422F-8591-707074E6061B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sharing the Pain: Perceptions of Fairness Affect Private and Public Response to Hazards</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of the American Association of Geographers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4cf1675d4a66f1d74eb093849d2e1e4"><gtr:id>d4cf1675d4a66f1d74eb093849d2e1e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adger W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5769477d076121.05886587</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8BFF597B-8D41-4A8C-A3FD-EAA4F4CC24B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wellbeing in the aftermath of floods.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp;
