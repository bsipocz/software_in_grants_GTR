What is the role of memory in the transition to peace and the shaping of national identity? The uncertain and troubled aftermath of many recent civil wars reminds us today just how important these questions are. In response to a growing interest in such issues, memory studies have developed into a flourishing field of research in recent years, yet little attention has been paid so far to early modern remembering processes, which, my project argues, have intellectual, cultural and social values for us today.

In this context, my project concentrates on the aftermath of the mid-seventeenth-century civil wars known as the Fronde ('Sling') (1648-53), which took place during the minority of Louis XIV. The last upheaval of the Ancien Regime before the French Revolution, these wars brought the aristocracy, the parliaments and the people into opposition with the court. There is no doubt that it was in reaction to these troubles that the king subsequently engineered an authoritarian absolute monarchy in which the memory of the Fronde was challenged by strict censorship. Yet, the conflict was not erased from history by decision of the king: historians, playwrights and novelists continued to reflect, distort and re-create the events of the Fronde, thereby contributing to the shaping of a collective memory of the wars. By overwhelmingly ignoring the ways in which the Fronde was written and rewritten after the troubles, today's historians seem to award Louis XIV this final victory. My project thus addresses the need to reassess the significance of the memory of the Fronde. 
 
My research will look at works of history and fiction rewriting the Fronde and their relationship to propaganda, political thought and the philosophy of history. In the first area, the project will explore the various strategies used by many of the authors studied to defy censorship, convey criticism of the regime and deconstruct the image of a great reign elaborated by Louis XIV's propaganda. In addition, the project will examine how many of the works studied offer radical reflections on the best form of government, thus providing a link between Renaissance political thought and that of the Enlightenment, a link which has hitherto been overlooked. Finally, many of the works studied also use the Fronde to call into question the capacity of history to teach us lessons: they form an understudied factor accounting for the scepticism associated with neo-classical French literature. Moreover, the works studied also reveal shifting conceptions of history, often opposing a cyclical representation of political time inspired by Antiquity to a linear vision of history inspired by Christianity; however, in a period of increasing secularisation, civil wars like the Fronde are increasingly seen as resulting merely from human actions and explained by the then emerging notion of self-interest. 

In showing that the memory of the Fronde has a key part to play in the evolution of political thought and the philosophy of history, my project will make an original contribution to the study of early-modern France. Seeking a cross-pollination of approaches developed by literary history, historiography and memory studies, the project also promotes an original methodology, one which can be applied to other areas beyond French studies, as the conclusion to my book and an article discussing the methods used in this project will show. With this in mind, I will organise a conference on post-conflict memory in early modern Europe aimed at fostering a transversal approach across disciplines and a dialogue with stakeholders who can influence post-conflict policies today as well as with members of the general public. In order to engage a wider audience beyond academia, workshops in local schools will also be organised to encourage critical thinking on the remembrance of civil wars and the writing of history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the last three or four decades, the troubled aftermath of many civil wars such as those in Northern Ireland, the former Yugoslavia or the so-called Arab Spring, has generated a high level of interest beyond academia for the study of post-conflict strategies. Along with transitional justice, negotiation and restoration, post-conflict remembering processes are indeed pivotal to the restoration of peace in war-torn countries. These are also essential to the well-being of societies like ours, which may be described as a product of (more or less distant) conflicts. Addressing an audience beyond academia, my research aims to promote a greater awareness of the strategies used in the past to reconcile divided communities, thereby fostering better informed opinions and debates on contemporary post-conflict policies and practices. 
 
To this end, specific sessions of the conference will foster a comparative approach to practices in the early modern and contemporary periods, and encourage a dialogue between academic researchers and other stakeholders in public sector bodies who can influence decision-makers with regard to remembrance policies. I will invite contributions from institutions which have been successful in creating such a dialogue - in particular, the Academy for Irish Cultural Heritages in Northern Ireland, the Fondation pour la m&amp;eacute;moire de la Shoah and the UNESCO. Workshops on transversal themes will ensure greater integration between academic and non-academic contributors. Dedicated evening sessions will seek to engage the general public. Contributors will share their views on issues such as the extent to which a political legislation of memory may be effective or desirable; the extent to which amnesia or selective forgetfulness may be beneficial; the issue of how inclusive commemoration may need to be in order to transform itself into a shared memory; or the healing role of partial, fictional or counterfactual memory. Not only will the conference give histoical foundation to debates on post-conflict policies, but the study of practices of amnesty, reintegration and commemoration in the early modern period will encourage a renewed approach to these questions today.

Using my research to encourage critical thinking on the politics of memory, I will also organise workshops in local schools aimed at Advanced Higher students taking History. Students will compare two conflicting accounts of the day of the barricades (one by a courtier, the other by a Frondeur). The partiality of these accounts and their ironic undertones will form the basis for a discussion on the ways in which ideology is embedded in the very form of history. This will also foster a reflection on the relationship between power and memory. In a follow-up session, students will look at the ways in which the memory of the Fronde is being transmitted today, using the free online encyclopaedia Wikipedia as a case study. In identifying the shortcomings of this entry, students will be encouraged to look at its one-sided nature, due essentially to a lack of sources. Students will think of ways to improve this page, in particular by incorporating the texts which will have been discussed in the earlier session. The revised version of the page will be published online. To conclude the workshops, parallels will be drawn between the Fronde and other, more recent, post-conflict situations. Fostering a form of experiential learning which empowers students to write as historians, these workshops aim to cultivate students' generic skills for evaluating source materials, develop their awareness of trans-historical patterns in conflict resolution and remembering, and nurture their abilities to form a critical judgement on post-conflict policies and practices.

These impact activities thus contribute in different ways towards the creation of social and cultural benefits by translating my research approaches and outcomes for audiences beyond academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85523</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>0</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Elphinstone Grant (3-year tuition fee waiver for a PhD candidate to work on the memory of the English Civil War in 17th-century France)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Aberdeen</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B0F780A3-D2A2-4D81-AD93-85B609CA7FC5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54622ad4aff6b8.79739472</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project looked at issues of representation and memory associated with the French civil wars known as the Fronde (1648-53). Even though early modern and modern ways of remembering and commemorating conflict differ in many respects, studying the former may help understand the latter, by comparing diverse, historically dated responses to common, cross-period issues and by giving historical foundations to contemporary memory practices. In this perspective, the project sought to make an impact primarily in educational and cultural terms. In working toward this goal, I have followed two different pathways, with engagement activities on the one hand and interdisciplinary, cross-sector exchange on the other.

In the first area, activities were aimed at audiences other than those with whom I am usually in contact, and I concentrated on postgraduate students outside my institution. For instance, I discussed my research on political readership and the memory of polemics generated by the Fronde with MLitt and PhD students in early modern French literature (Paris-Sorbonne, November 2014); I met with postgraduate students in Book history to talk about my research on censorship and manuscript or print circulation of banned titles after the Fronde (Centre for the History of the Book, Edinburgh, November 2015).

The project also sought to foster a dialogue between researchers and professional practitioners around issues of commemoration, memorialisation and reconciliation associated with civil wars. Together with Karine Deslandes (Buckingham) and Fabrice Mourlon (Paris 13), I co-organised an interdisciplinary, cross-sector event that explored the relationship between testimony, historiography and memory in the aftermath of intra-state conflicts. Held in May 2015 at the University of London School of Advanced Study, the event brought together academic researchers in a number of disciplines and professional stakeholders involved in recording, archiving and analysing testimonies by victims and perpetrators. Priority was given to papers taking a comparative approach to civil wars or looking at long timescales. In order to encourage interdisciplinary exchanges, panels and roundtables were organised thematically, rather than based on specific conflicts, and the programme included sessions looking at, for instance, oral history archives; historiography and public memory; narratives and political agency; and storytelling, healing and reconciliation. Q&amp;amp;A sessions provided an opportunity to exchange with psychotrauma clinicians and peace practitioners, some of whom had experience working for non-governmental organisations such as the Foundation for Peace, Healing Through Remembering and Vivo - Victim's Voice. The event was attended by researchers, postgraduate students and members of the public. Among other outcomes, delegates discussed the ways in which competing accounts of conflicts evolve to adapt to changing memory landscapes and how they are often partly obliterated by the silencing narrative of peace. Delegates also highlighted the fragile, often ambivalent status of testimonies in methodological, historical, therapeutic and legal terms, while also stressing their essential role in truth recovery and conflict transition. 

In organizing these activities, we are therefore hoping that we have met our objectives and contributed to enhancing public understanding of some of the major issues faced by individuals and society in remembering intra-state conflicts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C24DCD3-65D0-4A94-84F9-B830B131C3C9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56dd831a9492d4.56467663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project focused on the representation of the seventeenth-century French civil wars known as the Fronde (1648-53). The conflict, which broke out during the minority of Louis XIV, brought the parliament and aristocracy into opposition with the court led by Cardinal Mazarin and subsequently these parties continued to clash over the contested memory of the Fronde: used as a negotiating tool or a means of apology by former opponents, it was also instrumental in fashioning the image of the new king and promoting his style of government. Looking at various forms of historical writing, the project thus aimed at understanding the processes behind personal and collective memory, and their significance for monarchical propaganda, the representation of history and the evolution of political thought in seventeenth-century France.

Among its key findings, this research contributes to a reassessment of royal historiography, highlighting the difficulties faced by official historians and the ambiguities of their work. In so doing, it recasts the opposition between personal narratives and official histories, showing that the Fronde had a part to play in the ultimate failure of the latter to produce a satisfying history of the Sun King. The project also helps to further our understanding of the early modern conception of history, by locating the memory of the Fronde alongside other factors accounting for its evolution; it shows that the conflict reinforced contemporaries' scepticism towards the possibility of drawing lessons from the past and that it further alienated them from the exemplarity associated with Humanist history. In the realm of fiction, the events of the Fronde contributed to promoting ethically less prescriptive, more ambiguous modes of narration and characterisation, thus playing a part in the advent of the modern novel. Finally, the project shows that the memory of the Fronde had a role to play in the emergence of new political readership. While anti-Louis XIV propaganda sought to recycle the war of pamphlets waged against Mazarin during the Fronde, historians gave a voice to former opponents and to their alternative projects for the monarchy, which fiction writers remobilised to entertain their readers. In so doing, they encouraged by different means a reflection on the ideological uses of the past and on the political languages associated with them, thereby equipping readership with critical tools which were later fostered by the Enlightenment. 

Some of these findings have been presented at conferences such as that of the Society for Seventeenth-Century French Studies (Durham, September 2014; St Andrews, July 2015) or the Society for French Studies (Aberdeen, July 2014). I have written papers on aspects of the project, which have been published in collections of essays and journals such as Seventeenth-Century French Studies, XVIIe si&amp;egrave;cle and Revue d'histoire litt&amp;eacute;raire de la France. I am currently working on a book which aims to bring together the main outcomes of this award. I am therefore hoping that the key objectives of this project have been met and that it will complement existing scholarship on historical cultures in early modern France.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am hoping that the outcomes of this project might be relevant to researchers working on early modern historical cultures, in particular scholars in seventeenth-century French studies interested in the history of historiography and the interplay between history and fiction in a variety of genres, including historical novels, political pamphlets and forms of life-writing. Outside academia, the project sought to make an impact primarily in cultural terms, and I am hoping that some of its outcomes might be relevant to stakeholders working to enhance public understanding of the issues faced by individuals and society in remembering intra-state conflicts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6228D98-5805-48C8-8766-6402A256540F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd84dc4447f4.05447321</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A9B5030-7CA5-4168-941D-C97A7C101E4A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Le livre &amp;agrave; venir: la gen&amp;egrave;se des M&amp;eacute;moires de La Rochefoucauld</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Revue d'Histoire litt?raire de la France</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d"><gtr:id>12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58a19c697ccab2.49665971</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E22D13A1-7FFE-4F8F-B5B0-AFBADC172DA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Litt&amp;eacute;rature et politique: factions et dissidences de la Ligue &amp;agrave; la Fronde</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e4c04136507fe285b5274e738562aa5"><gtr:id>8e4c04136507fe285b5274e738562aa5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout, B.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56a8f8ae91f3b7.00267927</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A6EB065-5BEC-49A8-A945-E38D1AC5A5B2</gtr:id><gtr:title>La sc&amp;egrave;ne pol&amp;eacute;mique des M&amp;eacute;moires: l'exemple de Guy Joly et du cardinal de Retz</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>XVIIe si?cle</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d"><gtr:id>12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58a19c1399ff68.50325107</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A15FA484-776B-42FD-8FAC-7BB24434AA94</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tacite et le tacitisme en Europe &amp;agrave; l'&amp;eacute;poque moderne (XVIe- XVIIIe si&amp;egrave;cle). &amp;Eacute;criture de l'histoire et conception du pouvoir</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d"><gtr:id>12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56a8fc0fb334d4.55275407</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE4EABBA-2E84-4DEC-981E-245B8D06E726</gtr:id><gtr:title>La m&amp;eacute;moire des Mazarinades&amp;nbsp;: une critique politique sous Louis XIV</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Revue d'histoire litt?raire de la France</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d"><gtr:id>12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56a8f768e5ee23.54748552</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E2CCCAC-1EEF-4678-86F1-FA9DF42143EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Une m&amp;eacute;moire critique de la Fronde: formes et fonctions du pastiche dans les M&amp;eacute;moires apocryphes de Courtilz de Sandras</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>French Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d"><gtr:id>12105d03a6ee0f2fcb41897fb01a008d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tribout B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56a8ffe0023328.36055109</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L002221/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
