(CaTalyST)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I033017/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We define citizen-led (social) innovation as the bottom-up creation of community-driven solutions to major societal problems. Citizen-led innovation has been an active ingredient of societies for centuries. However, technological developments such as online social networks and mobile computing have made it easier than ever before to initiate and nurture it; these technologies permit 'ridiculously easy group forming' and have led to civic engagement on a scale and with an efficiency not seen before.Recent events mean that now is both an opportune and critically necessary time for citizen-led innovation. On the one hand, society has experienced a massive global economic crisis. We are all being asked to do more for less and one consequence is that citizens are now expected to become more active participants in solving local problems (cf. Big Society). On the other hand, governments in both the UK and US are opening up public data in a drive for transparency that puts information into the hands of citizens in a way never before envisaged. This proposal addresses two core themes that will maximize the opportunities for citizens to transform society: understanding behaviour (what stimulates people to participate and why) and tools for change (what next-generation technologies best support how people want to innovate). Regarding the first theme, much of what is being proposed by governments - Localism, National Citizen Service, Big Society - is being implemented without a sociological understanding of what people need from it. Regarding the second, although social technologies have been extremely effective in promoting citizen-led activism, they were not designed specifically for it; it is natural, therefore, to ask what the next generation of tools should look like and to design those tools with the wants and needs of participatory citizens firmly in mind.Furthermore, there are fundamental barriers to overcome. In particular, there is a well-known tension between innovation and inclusion. Experience from organisations such as Community Matters shows that a major reason for citizens engaging in social action is the need for more human contact; however, technology has a tendency to reduce human contact in favour of virtual contact. We therefore see that a fundamental challenge is to reverse this trend. In all our research activities, we will emphasise this goal and work towards technologies that are mediators and not replacements for human contact. Our research methodology puts people-based activities at the forefront of an integrated research/people strategy that aims to answer fundamental research questions about citizen-led innovation via a series of 'research sprints' that will combine discipline hopping, cross-discipline training, a community-driven research agenda and reflection on the interdisciplinary process itself.The project will bring together a group of social scientists (sociology; anthropology), computer scientists (mobile computing; web2.0; distributed systems), management scientists (consumer behaviour) and designers (innovation) to develop next generation systems that empower citizens to create bottom-up innovative solutions to 'wicked' societal problems. We will work with partners in Manchester and Derry with which we have a history of success: the Manchester Digital Development Agency (MDDA) and FutureEverything in Manchester; Derry District Policing Partnership (DDPP) in Derry. We will also focus on widening the research to communities across the UK. This will be facilitated by two organisations - the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) and Community Matters</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who Will Benefit From This Research and How Will They Benefit? (i) Community groups in Derry, NI, and Manchester, England. The team has a track record, dating back to the 1980s, of cutting-edge research in computer and social sciences, with tangible benefits to communities. The research programme focuses on two areas where the team has previously worked: Derry, Northern Ireland, and Manchester, England. Both areas have significant societal issues to address. Derry was at the centre of the Troubles in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was the location of the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972. Today, the city is still grappling with improving trust between local peoples and the police. The city also has one of the largest unemployment rates in NI and has some of its most deprived estates. Manchester, on the other hand, also has significant problems with community cohesion - it has the highest number of ASBOs outside London, for example. Both cities also have great expertise at hand which can be used in knowledge sharing with the other location. Derry is well known as a centre of best practice for community regeneration. Manchester is pioneering work in open data, open source, and bottom-up development of applications for social innovation. The research will add to these efforts. A major goal of the project is to find innovative ways of using technology, informed by sound social science theory and practice, that will promote community cohesion in these areas. (ii) Community groups across the UK The team will also bring benefits to communities across the UK beyond Derry and Manchester. The team will work with two key community organisations - Community Matters and the RSA - who are experts in social and community innovation and will broker links with their networks of communities for promoting the results of the research in the form of community deployments, trials and public awareness. (iii) Government - both national and local At the current time, spurred on by Big Society initiatives, both national and local governing bodies are reaching out for solutions for bottom-up social innovation. A major outcome of the project will be a set of social, technological and practical guidelines for running community projects facilitated by technology. The research will add new insights to fundamental research questions relating to the motivation for citizens to engage in society initiatives and the role of technology in supporting it. Impact will be maximised by working with the RSA who is well connected with politicians such as Lord Wei, advisor to the Government on Big Society, and Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society. Community Matters is also a Strategic Partner to the Government on such matters. The team will disseminate to the Government via the guidelines above as well as policy-related documents such as the Citizen-Led Innovation Manifesto, which will be created in year three of the project. (iv) Non-profit and for-profit companies in e-government, open data and big society There is a rapidly growing industry building infrastructure and applications for e-government, open data and big society: cf. Gov 2.0, apps for democracy, challenge.gov, data.gov.uk, etc. The research will provide next generation open source platforms, applications and ideas to be exploited by this industry. Impact will be ensured by working with organisations with a track record of successful technology transfer and commercialisation: Lancaster's Knowledge Business Centre and FutureEverything. In particular, the latter is a pioneering organisation promoting open data in Manchester and is already working with groups such as Manchester Open Data developers group to persuade governments to improve transparency by opening up public data sets and to exploit such data sets. The research will also be widely disseminated to the public through FutureEverything's annual festival, which regularly attracts 50,000 visitors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1513052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Development of two interactive physical-digital artefacts - videos of them can be found on http://imagination.lancs.ac.uk/activities/Active_Parks</gtr:description><gtr:id>F63C02A0-CD66-4601-9082-0C71300EA139</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Showcased at festival, town centre locations, University 50th anniversary events</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54638a4b897855.95896179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Active Parks Ative Citizens</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://imagination.lancs.ac.uk/activities/Active_Parks</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>#PAT used and recreated as a art exhibit as part of Curate the Campus</gtr:description><gtr:id>B9D44405-A3FF-41C9-A0ED-C523B49C64FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased audience and potential use of prototype</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464984750f622.30223466</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Inside Out Exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.liveatlica.org/whats-on/curate-the-campus-2013-insideout</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Catalyst exhibition comprising of 100's of images from each of the partnerships, projects and engagement,

Films of all projects as follows
A selection of five films are below:
1) #Patchworks project participants introduce a prototype called #PAT, a Personal Appointment Ticketing service. #Pat is intended to enable homeless people living chaotic transient lives to track their appointments with the swipe of an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) enabled wristband or card. The team developed a shoebox-size device that contained a Raspberry Pi low-cost computer, RFID reader, and a tiny printer, similar to that in an electronic cash register. The #Pat device then prints out a personalized reminder list of appointment dates, times and places. As such, #Pat provides inexpensive, mobile access to information for those with limited or restricted internet access. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydPcxuixhAw
2) Access ASD, saw computer scientists, sociologists and designers, working with people with Autism to develop a prototype called 'clasp' (follow on funding has just been confirmed): 'Clasp' is a hand-held digital anxiety management tool, controlled by sensory response. On squeezing, the tool connects to a digital peer support network, that is safe and secure, to help reduce isolation and gain immediate support. The tool also provides an anxiety tracking system, including a GPS-based locator facility, enabling users to monitor and self-regulate their behaviour. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjvLZrEYE7M 
3) The Launchpad project, Local Wealth: Local Trade, has now received follow-on funding and developed into Barter. Barter is developing a mobile application for a new loyalty trading system which records transactions and tracks the trading patterns to reward sustainable and locally beneficial trading in Lancaster. It uses near field communication (NFC) enabled loyalty cards that are swiped every time a trade is made. The data thus collected can then be viewed over time to reflect on trading practices. http://barterproject.org/so-what-is-barter/

'On Supply' works with the citizens of Tiree, a small island off the west coast of Scotland, exploring how new energy awareness devices might help communities reflect on when energy is available and promote use at 'greener' times.
Due to a favourable wind environment, the citizens of Tiree generate a significant proportion of their energy using 'Tilley', a 900kW turbine.

The challenge was to create an online crowd sourced film making system to provide a new form of citizen communication and engagement. 
The system is being designed so that, on a larger scale, the sequences of video can be configured not only by time, but also by user and location. For example, a film called 'Love' in Paris will look different to one made in London. It is currently at an experimental stage where clips are looped in time sequence under the film title.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancaster University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>HighWire</gtr:department><gtr:description>Community Data Explorer: launchpad project</gtr:description><gtr:id>73D03381-A3D4-470E-A800-4E76FE67ACFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visualising public data in compelling ways can make community members more aware of the possibility of delivering new services.

The project will explore possibilities for delivering services differently and enable citizens to develop new skills to improve the workforce. Through the project local residents will identify priority data sets in the community, obtain access to the data, clean the data and develop an API (application programming interface). These apps will form the heart of a &amp;quot;Community Data Explorer&amp;quot; app for local authorities.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>With the government's push towards localism - such as the right to build, communities need to understand publicly available data before they can make informed decisions.

It's estimated that around 700,000 people in the UK have autism, with a third of adults with the condition experiencing social and mental health problems due to a lack of support.
Many people on the autistic spectrum find difficulties in interacting with other people, and the project worked with adults on the spectrum to identify what things cause them difficulties and to devise tools that might help.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East Anglia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Tyndall Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>EcoHome Launchpad project</gtr:description><gtr:id>B8ADDED1-853A-4C8F-BD31-E4CA579D8888</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project launch event 19/04/2013 and build day 20/04/2014

On Supply will contribute to the debate in sustainability generally and specifically in sustainable human computer interaction, generating an understanding of what would make people change behaviour regarding the energy they use.
The produced publications and outreach, a legacy proof of concept infrastructure for monitoring home use, grid load and Tilley (the turbine) generation. In consideration for longer term development the project may involve further communities (e.g. the nearby island of Eigg).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Renewable energy sources challenge us to think differently about the expectation that energy is always available whenever we demand it. 'On Supply' works with the citizens of Tiree, a small island off the west coast of Scotland, exploring how new energy awareness devices might help communities reflect on when energy is available and promote use at 'greener' times.
Due to a favourable wind environment, the citizens of Tiree generate a significant proportion of their energy using 'Tilley', a 900kW turbine. This project will work with local communities to co-design interactive technologies aimed at reinforcing the connection between citizens and the energy from their turbine.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press Coverage for Catalyst Projects</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08273D8A-2FBD-4BF3-A285-9CC79FF336BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Supply News features:

2. Access ASD: Clasp - digital anxiety management tool
3. OnSupply prototypes: A suite of Energy prototypes have been created
I. Tilley Twinkle - LED augmented physical Christmas card was developed to communicate the time varying nature of energy. The lights changed colour depending on Tiree's wind turbine (Tilley) energy output; 
II. Turbine Tree - a digital Christmas tree that's lights showed the energy supply within the last 24 hours on the island. The lights changed colour depending on the turbine output; 
III. Energy Pulse App - renewable energy data forecasting system for response energy usage. This can be used within individuals homes and the community; 
IV. Energy Detectors - renewable energy data discovery and capture devices. This prototype was used with schools, as an outreach tool, taken on out-door expeditions and field trips (for more information see PREP); 
V. Energy Data Hub - a website developed to co-exist with the Energy Detectors. The site was used to map and visual data captured from the Energy Detectors and through observation. The website can be accessed by clicking here. 
VI. Datarium - an optic fibre energy-data display that changes colour depending on the supply of energy (past, present or future); and
VII. SQRL - radio controlled smart plugs that turn on/off appliances when there is sufficient/insufficient power to the island; 
VIII. Windy-Brew - similar to SQRL, it is a kettle that will only boil when sufficient energy is available on the island; and
IX. Ping Pong Power - game developed to enable workshop participants to visualise energy supply and usage.
5. Policy Beta: Community policy creating platform
6. Active Parks: Active Citizens - Two prototypes one which is an interactive xylophone
7. DigitalHeartlink - Crowd sourced cheering/heart monitoring app
8. LifeMirror - Crowd sourced cinema app
9. Less is More - online game proof of concept 
Local Trade: Local Wealth - digital trade app and loyalty card
Ecohome - Open source energy monitor kit
Community Data Explorer - visualisation app and website</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4B020F9-95FF-451E-9677-80F699B69691</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collectively these products have resulted in Societal, Cultural and Economic impacts being made</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54649ee30387b1.67471158</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Catalyst Project Protypes</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://catalystproject.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D45ABEC1-B8A7-4F6A-83C5-38CAB9849D10</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patchworks: Citizen-Led Innovation for Chaotic Lives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfb803f6c1ffca5e82e8dd3cdb1f5d90"><gtr:id>cfb803f6c1ffca5e82e8dd3cdb1f5d90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Southern, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5462145d53d890.12553356</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E277571F-4A90-4532-9629-916245654942</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exercising playfully: co-designing fun ways of keeping active in the park.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5db3474eb85537113e62ebae36b1fe56"><gtr:id>5db3474eb85537113e62ebae36b1fe56</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tsekleves, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546219d7864172.71744012</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7EA63281-D960-4245-A457-7131B02A6AD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Julianna Rotich: Ushahidi and Global Voices with Catalyst: Citizens Transforming Society Tools for Change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Future Everything, Manchester, 16 - 19/05/2012</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2bae4fe63aa169c75d54b690d33dd0f9"><gtr:id>2bae4fe63aa169c75d54b690d33dd0f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rotich, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463cddf9109c0.29146147</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EF26CD4-ABC9-428F-96CF-FE94EAD6CB98</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tackling ethical challenges in community-based participatory research, Catalyst case study,</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e9757213d59ecbe80fd21cd3186dba3e"><gtr:id>e9757213d59ecbe80fd21cd3186dba3e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ellis, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545fd2e70764a2.95921779</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F3965158-FD5B-4948-9FE3-D80771A95EEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Clasp: Digital Tactile ASD Anxiety Management</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e7e1b2d838289c4ce4e6396b3d510188"><gtr:id>e7e1b2d838289c4ce4e6396b3d510188</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simm, W.A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5462121192af30.57830202</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FD7624E8-94DC-445A-BC0D-5303C46F8AD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Edge of Supply: Designing Renewable Energy Supply into Everyday life.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f97b3d9615e6f076f9d5362d841985bc"><gtr:id>f97b3d9615e6f076f9d5362d841985bc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ferrario, M.
