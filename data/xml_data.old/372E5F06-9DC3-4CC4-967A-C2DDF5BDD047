Benefitting from knowledge gained through being part of the editorial team for the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift, the projected book will have the objective of presenting a new literary and critical account of Swift's life and work, an account of Swift for the 21st century. \n\nThe fundamental contribution to be made by such a study is to record and assess new knowledge generated since the standard biographies by Ehrenpreis, Nokes and others were written. New letters and poems by Swift have come to light, while much new bibliographical material is available on existing canonical writings. We know much more than we once did about what Swift read, how he read, and how that shapes what he wrote. Recent research on the Irish background to Swift's writing has challenged a long-standing Anglocentric view of him; though the Hibernian view of him has been difficult to get into balance. As an Hibernian patriot, he has been claimed for both sides of the religio-cultural divide. In 1978, a new Irish ten-pound note bore his image, testimony to Swift's establishment status; but his incendiary statement in the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture, 'burn everything English but their coal', is deployed as a motto by the IRA. The question of what kind of Protestant, clergyman and religious believer Swift was is far from being a settled one. \n\nNew arguments have been made about his masterpiece Gulliver: about its sources and its intentions. Those need to be updated, evaluated and developed. The question of Swift's relations with women - the imputed misogyny of his relations with them and writings about them - is brought into focus by A.C. Elias' recent scholarly edition of Laetitia Pilkington's Memoirs. Understanding of Swift's relations with Stella and Vanessa needs to incorporate the implications of this often surprising and intimate account.\n\nThe projected book, written for a series devoted to Irish writers and to be published by a Dublin press, will offer a re-evaluation of Swift's life and writing for the present time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F005873/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
