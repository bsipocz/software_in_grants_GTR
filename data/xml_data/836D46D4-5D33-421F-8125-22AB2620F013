People in employment are less likely to be in poverty than those without paid work but the benefits of entry into employment where pay is low are questionable, especially if they form part of a 'no pay, low pay cycle'. For poverty reduction a focus solely on moving into work is insufficient.

In-work poverty has become an increasingly important issue as labour market changes have led to changing working practices (e.g. fragmentation of working hours and zero hours contacts, etc) and a broader polarisation between lower paid and higher paid jobs which impedes progression in employment as a route out of poverty. More 'good' jobs are needed that poor people can access and progress in if more sustainable exits from poverty are to be achieved.

Following the economic crisis of 2008/9 there has been a renewed interest in industrial policy in attempts to stimulate economic growth. Governments have identified specific sectors (so called 'growth sectors' or 'strategic sectors') as a focus of policy attention. The proposed research seeks to fill a gap in evidence about 'what works' in harnessing growth sectors for poverty reduction - in recognition that growth sectors: (1) generate opportunities for those out of work to move into; (2) are the focus of policy to support the growth of opportunity; (3) are more likely to experience skills deficiencies, so encouraging engagement with skills and training providers; and (4) may be seeking to reduce staff turnover through developing more clearly defined progression opportunities. Hence the research addresses two of the Welsh Government's strategic priorities: (i) tackling poverty and (ii) promoting jobs and growth.

The proposed research focus consists of four elements which together synthesise and assess evidence on how growth sectors may be used for poverty reduction.

Element I provides contextual and quantitative analyses of growth sectors. It identifies growth sectors, the number and profile of jobs therein and their growth trajectories. It uses existing large survey data sets to examine how people move between and within growth sectors, and whether and how such moves help people to move out of poverty. It also identifies which sectors offer the best opportunities for progression out of poverty.

Element II focuses on reviews of the existing national and international evidence on 'what works' in helping poor people gain entry to growth sectors and how their employment progression can be facilitated. It also examines evidence on how job quality in growth sectors can be enhanced. 'Good practice' examples of relevance to the Welsh context will be identified.

Element III involves six in-depth case studies of practical initiatives to harness growth sectors for poverty reduction. A mix of 'top-down' approaches driven by national governments and 'bottom-up' approaches led by local authorities and groups of employers in particular sectors will be examined.

Element IV brings together and tests the findings of the research, emphasising what policy levers are available for harnessing growth sectors for poverty reduction, and how they might be best used. Stakeholders will be invited to participate in this process of knowledge generation and transfer at workshops held in different parts of Wales in an attempt to maximise the applicability of the 'what works' findings to the Welsh context.

Together the different elements of the research project, involving secondary data analysis, evidence reviews and case studies, will address gaps in:
- existing knowledge on job mobility and poverty;
- interventions to support entry to, progression, and job quality in growth sectors; and
- how public policy can address poverty by facilitating sustainable employment in growth sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential impact of the proposed research is far reaching. The insights generated will directly benefit strategic and operational policy making and service delivery in the public, private and third sectors. It will help stakeholders to devise and refine policy approaches targeted at poverty reduction. Most importantly, the final beneficiaries of the research are people who move out of poverty as a result of improvements in opportunities stemming for evidence-based policymaking. If growth sectors can be harnessed more effectively for the reduction of poverty as well as for economic growth this will benefit the economy and society more broadly.

More specifically, the list below indicates who benefits and how they benefit:
1. Strategic policy makers in government and government agencies at sub-national and national scales - New evidence produced on the scale, intensity and patterns of labour mobility by sector will enhance understanding of labour market dynamics as they relate to poverty reduction and should help inform more nuanced targeting of policy to promote sustainable employment in 'good' jobs. A comprehensive evidence base of 'what works' around getting individuals into employment in growth sectors, supporting progression and raising job quality will enable policymakers to intelligently design and target sector-based policies that are most likely to reduce poverty.
2. Service deliverers in public, private and third sector organisations - The marshalling of the evidence on 'what works' in linking people to the labour market, facilitating progression in the labour market and raising the quality of jobs, together with detailed information on different approaches and their strengths and weaknesses as well as challenges and opportunities faced in implementing interventions will help inform and refine approaches to service delivery.
3. Sectoral bodies - The research is intended to complement existing information and intelligence, and provide insights into, and experience of, the challenges and opportunities for different approaches to integrating social inclusion and economic growth agendas.
4. Employers and employers' organisations: The evidence reviews and detailed case studies will provide learning opportunities for advancing the employer ownership of skills agenda and for how it might be better linked to wider welfare concerns.
5. Workforce development organisations: The evidence generated by the research will be helpful in informing and promoting workforce development strategies - in the interests of employees and employers.
6. Organisations concerned with poverty reduction and people in poverty - The new evidence generated and synthesised will helpf identify what sectors offer most opportunities for moves out of poverty through sustainable employment in 'good' jobs, and so help targeting of activity. People who move out of poverty are the key beneficiaries.
7. The wider public - The ultimate aim of harnessing growth sectors for poverty reduction is to improve the welfare and opportunities of those in poverty; meeting this aim should also improve societal well-being more widely.

The research team brings together experienced applied researchers with experience of working together and separately on projects for sponsors with interests in poverty, economic growth and the labour market - including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, the DWP, BIS, governments in the devolved nations, the European Commission and the OECD, local government, regional development agencies and third sector organisations. As such the research team is experienced in preparing and disseminating research findings to a range of audiences. For this project the reach in Wales will be extended through the involvement throughout the project of the Bevan Foundation and their leading role in ensuring integration of key stakeholders in the research and the effective dissemination of the results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177672</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy influencing and impact workshop 3 with the Bevan Foundation - Cardiff 1</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA5F4653-E9C4-42D4-A1E8-90FA940A9F4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the third of four impact workshops held with the Bevan Foundation in different parts of Wales / with different subsets of practitioners and policy makers on the topic of 'How growing sectors of the economy can reduce poverty'.

These were fruitful in raising the issues and challenges of harnessing growth sectors for poverty reduction amongst practitioners and policy makers. In particular, the sessions were useful in emphasising the potential for entry into, and progressing in, employment in large employment sectors (such as hospitality, social care and construction).

More specifically, the Workshops led to Business Wales (the organisation which delivering business advice for Welsh Government) asking the Bevan Foundation to deliver four training sessions for their staff (total 100) in January-March 2017 - covering poverty, the Living Wage, and the evidence on effective solutions around recruitment, in-work skills and progression.

Material from the evidence review on progression was used to inform and was heavily cited in an application in 2017 for Employment Innovation Pilot funding (from the Department for Work and Pensions) from the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>257788F3-272B-4B3E-9139-C25FE057D561</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deb75316fd98.78200896</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research demonstrates:

THE NEED FOR POLICY TO CONSIDER HIGH EMPLOYMENT GROWTH SECTORS
'Growth sectors' may be defined as those where Gross Value Added (GVA) and/or employment are projected to increase over the medium-term. Conventionally sector policy has focused on high value sectors but medium-term employment projections indicate important sectoral differences in likely future employment openings, with greatest projected employment growth being in low-paid occupations in sectors like Accommodation &amp;amp; food services and Care. It is appropriate for policy to target and seek to improve job quality in such growth sectors also because they generate opportunities for those out of work or in low pay in other sectors to potentially move into. High levels of staff turnover/skills shortages are potential drivers for engaging employers and targeting approaches to make employment more attractive.

THERE IS A SPECIFIC SECTORAL EFFECT OF BEING IN LOW PAY, ESCAPING LOW PAY AND BEING IN POVERTY
Quantitative analyses of wages/income by sector using the Labour Force Survey, the Family Resources Survey and Understanding Society show that the risk of in-work poverty is relatively diffuse over the whole economy. Nevertheless the relative risk of low-pay and poverty is much higher in some sectors than in others. Controlling for individual characteristics the highest probabilities of low pay are in Accommodation &amp;amp; food services, Residential care, Wholesale &amp;amp;retail, and Agriculture. Family characteristics, play an important role in determining poverty outcomes, but poverty persists in some sectors despite families having dual earners. The data analyses point to the existence of specific 'sectoral effects' in determining patterns of low pay/in-work poverty once other individual and household factors have been taken into account, this underscores that a sectoral approach may be useful way to target low pay and reduce in-work poverty. 

AGGREGATE LOCAL LABOUR DEMAND IS IMPORTANT FOR ESCAPING LOW PAY
Analyses of Understanding Society data show that aggregate employment growth at local level is more important than employment growth in specific sectors in influencing individuals' wage growth. This underlines the importance of the level of overall demand for labour locally for poverty reduction. This indicates that sector focused policy needs to be considered in a broader local ecosystem perspective and needs to be sensitive to place-specific factors. 

THE NEED FOR A GREATER POLICY EMPHASIS ON PROGRESSION
Evidence reviews on employment entry, progression in work and job quality revealed more evidence on employment entry than on progression in work and job quality. There is evidence that sector-specific training is helpful in facilitating job entry. Even though a sizeable proportion of low-paid workers experience limited pay progression over extended periods of time progression has not been a focus for employment policy and, there is relatively little robust evidence relating to initiatives targeting progression. The most robust evidence is from the US and is primarily from localised targeted initiatives which target entry into good quality employment opportunities, offering chances for career advancement. These studies point to a potential benefit of a sector-focused approach to progression (albeit there is insufficient evidence to identify the 'best' sectors to target), and demonstrate that initiatives can be designed to support worker progression.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings may be taken forward by:

? Strategic policy makers in government and agencies at national and sub-national level and sectoral bodies - using the results of quantitative data analysis and evidence reviews to intelligently design and target sector-based policies - in conjunction with employers and employers' associations - in such a way that they might help reduce poverty.

? Informing the design and delivery of employability programmes - using the results of evidence review to: (1) understand 'what works'; (2) consider pre-employment, employment entry, sustaining employment and progressing in employment interventions as linked in a single pathway; and (3) to shift the balance of emphasis from 'work first' to 'career first'.

? Organisations concerned with poverty reduction and people in poverty - using the evidence reviews and case studies from sector-specific policies elsewhere: (1) to inform policy interventions in local areas in the UK; and (2) to expand the policy agenda to include job quality and conditions of employment.

? Academics with interests in regional and local economic development, industrial policy, labour markets, reducing poverty, employability and workforce development - using and building on the findings to: (1) undertake detailed studies of the dynamics of specific sectors and opportunities and constraints for improving employment outcomes and job quality; (2) local case studies; (3) evaluation of policy interventions; (4) data analysis extending over different/ longer time periods characterised by different prevailing economic conditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0128146B-902A-4DE1-891F-55AAE680B512</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb7a2b20f24.81234359</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ier/research/povertyreduction</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Supporting Cambridgeshire and Peterborough submission to Employment Innovations Pilot funding.
