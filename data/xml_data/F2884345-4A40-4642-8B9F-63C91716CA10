The system is targeted at residential and service sectors although it can be applied across all scales including industrial premises. The advantage of TRIGEN is its low capital cost, it can be mass produced and there is no cost and emissions associated with its energy input (i.e. solar - free and clean source of energy). All of these benefits contribute to the energy &amp;quot;trilemma&amp;quot; by reducing emissions, reducing cost of generation and by increasing security of supply through the increased uptake of decentralised generation systems. If successful, TRIGEN will bring solar energy closer to the user by developing a solution that makes it attractive and competitive for industries &amp;amp; households.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Inside the consortium (economic); EXE will develop knowledge enabling them to make more informed decisions about the system configuration of future tri-generation system they will design and test thereby increasing their competitive advantages and hence economic performance. Knowledge transfer will also highlight new approaches and technologies to partners, providing future scope for new innovations. CU has achieved certification to the International Environmental Management System Standard ISO 14001 across the whole of the campus. Participation in this project will serve as additional proof to client organisations of CU's commitment to responsible environmental practices and enhance CU public image over the next years. Outside the consortium; developers incorporating TRIGEN will benefit from lower energy cost in addition to lowering emissions creating an economic benefit for the energy producers. In 1996 about 11.000 GWh of primary energy were spent in Europe alone for small room air conditioners up to a cooling capacity of 12 kW; it is expected that this value increases by a factor of 4 to about 44.000 GWh by 2020. TRIGEN will reduce electricity loads at time of peak cooling demand due to the strong correlation between supply of the solar resource and energy demand for cooling. This will minimize the need for building new power stations in the UK. The proposed solar technology also aims to save 30% energy by replacing the conventional heating systems. In a 10 year period, this project aims to avoid 92,610 tonnes of CO2 emissions, considering a total sales of 1500 units (average building size of 700 m2 with a DEC rating of D). This in turn will lead to energy savings of 244 millions kWh of energy (through direct sales only), which is equivalent to reduction of &amp;pound;24M in energy bills. This puts this technology in prime position to capture a significant market share of the renewables market. The actual financial figures are difficult to predict at this early stage asthe cost of manufacture has not been determined yet (as the systems have not been designed yet). The tri-generation system proposed in this project is predicted to be 30% more efficient than current tri-generation systems (due to its compact and unique design) so there is a significant cost saving to energy producers of adopting the TRIGEN technology.

Social benefits, following successful demonstration of the system two new jobs will be created within EXE to support the exploitation of TIRGEN and its constituent elements. One research/academic positions will also be created to support the additional R&amp;amp;D required for a next generation system. The future development of the product, manufacturing and business model is aligned with EXE's team. A new, affordable tri-generation technology will help enable the UK (and the world) to move towards a low carbon society and address key societal issues such as environment as well as climate change. Environmental benefits, the high efficiency of TRIGEN in the production of emission-free heat, cool and electricity creating broad environmental and social benefits outside the consortium. Trigen will also minimize the use of HFCs, which have a global warming potential similar to that of HCFCs and 100 to 1000 of times greater CO2.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65943</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016316/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
