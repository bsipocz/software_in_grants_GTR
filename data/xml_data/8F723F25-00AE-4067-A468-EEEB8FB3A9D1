The study of the corresponding imaging, or reconstruction, problem is a more recent one. If the material parameters of the PDE present high contrast ratio, the solutions of the PDE become particularly challenging to analyse and to compute. Similar problems occur in time dependent equations in the frequency domain for high frequency. On the other hand, very high frequency regimes, or very contrasted materials, were considered first in imaging, as well-differentiated areas are, at first sight, simpler to locate by ad-hoc methods. Over the last decade the analysis of the inversion problem at moderate frequencies, the rigorous derivation of asymptotics at very high frequencies, and the regularity properties of solutions of elliptic PDE in very heterogeneous media have received a lot of attention.Part of the attention is due to the fact that these problems are particularly challenging. For another part, it is because of the numerous applications of these results in material sciences and in bio-medical imaging. Recently, emerging bio-medical imaging methods based on the observation of non-linear interactions of coupled physical phenomena (such as for example vibro-acoustography) have also become the subject of active research. Progresses on the mathematical understanding of the direct and inverse problems associated to these hybrid imaging methods are crucial to obtain enhanced imaging possibilities, beyond what is obtained by the integration of different imaging modalities taken separately. The focus of this workshop will be to stimulate collaborations between the participants, in the hope of achieving significant progress in (a) complete understanding of the direct problem with high contrast or high frequencies, (b) unified approaches to the inverse problem for both small and large contrast or frequencies, and (c) mathematical modelling of emerging experimental measurement methods. With this goal in mind, we wish to bring together senior experts and young researchers interested in the mathematical problems associated with imaging of multi-scale, or high contrast materials. All the mathematicians participating in the workshop are actively working on different aspects on these problems. Their expertise comprises heterogeneous random media, regularity theory for linear and non-linear PDE with very contrasted coefficients, mathematical invisibility (or cloaking), imaging and numerical reconstruction, numerical methods for high frequency elliptic problems, and emerging biomedical imaging methods. We have also invited an experimental physicist, whose recent work is devoted to new imaging methods for liquid crystals. The mathematical challenges associated with the mathematical formulation and understanding of these experiments and other hybrid measurement methods could be one of the applications of theoretical developments we hope this workshop will produce.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The problem of accurate imaging by non-invasive methods is of paramount importance in many applications, from medicine to material science. The research in medical imaging modalities is one of the celebrated strength of the UK, where CT, MRI, Impedance and Optical tomography were developed, leading to several Nobel prizes. The Inverse Problem journal is established in the UK, together with the Inverse Problem International Association. The mathematics of imaging is a growth area internationally. Several new journals (such as SIAM Imaging Science) have been created recently. The problem of accurate imaging by non-invasive methods is of paramount importance in many applications, from medicine to material sciences. The talks during the workshop will explain what is understood of this problem for high frequency problems, or in very contrasted media. The workshop should be most beneficial to mathematicians, but possible outcomes are very relevant to engineers and practitioners of inverse problems. The motivation to organise this workshop is originally due to the high impact of two preceding events organized in Seoul and Paris. The first one, entitled Workshop in Seoul: Inverse Problems, Multi-Scale Analysis and Homogenization was held in Seoul National University, Korea in 2005. The focus was the convergence of two previously distinct fields, homogenization theory and inverse problems. Among the outcomes of this workshop was a strengthened collaboration between physicists, working on time reversal experiments in material sciences. Amongst the mathematical achievements, the Poly-Szeg conjecture was solved, as a consequence of collaborations initiated by this workshop. A new imaging method, combining sonographic and electric measurements was also invented (and patented) as the result of a fruitful collaboration between participants. The second one, entitled Imaging Microstructure : Mathematical and Computational Challenges was held in Institut Henri Poincar, Paris in 2008. The focus of this meeting was on the mathematical challenges that appear in certain area of imaging. In this workshop, many new collaborations were developed, in particular between pure and applied mathematicians, as the workshop allowed the participants to realise a clear convergence of interests. The peer-reviewed proceedings of the workshop where published in the Contemporary Mathematics series of the AMS. During that workshop, it became apparent that the next frontier in imaging was high frequency, and/or high contrast. This workshop is focused on this challenging problem, which has deep implications both in the area of pure mathematics and in its applications to inverse problems as they appear in industry. In the two workshops mentioned above, several of the contributed papers where collaborations between either main speakers, or main speakers and attendees, and were the result of collaborations started during the workshop. We anticipate a similar outcome from this workshop. We plan to edit and publish proceedings form this workshop, either in the Modelling and Simulation in Medical Imaging Book Series of Imperial College Press, or in Contemporary Mathematics series of the AMS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15766</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The majority of the papers published in the proceedings of the workshop have been quoted several times.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>43DB211B-EEAF-4B93-953F-D984D755BC50</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5464ac2c10edc3.81561824</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Grant made possible a workshop entitled &amp;quot;Multi-Scale and High-Contrast

PDE: From Modelling, to Mathematical Analysis, to Inversion&amp;quot;, which was held June 28-July 1, 2011, at the University of Oxford.

The mathematical analysis of PDE modelling materials, or tissues, presenting multiple scales has been an active area of research for more than 40 years. The study of the corresponding imaging, or reconstruction, problem is a more recent one. If the material parameters of the PDE present high contrast ratio, then the solution to the PDE becomes particularly challenging to analyze, or compute. Similar difficulties occur in time dependent equations in high frequency regimes. Over the last decade the analysis of the inversion

problem at moderate frequencies, the rigorous derivation of asymptotics at high frequencies, and the regularity properties of solutions of elliptic PDE in highly heterogeneous media have received a lot of attention.



This workshop brought together senior experts and young researchers interested in the mathematical problems associated with imaging of multi-scale or high-contrast materials, working on the different aspects of these problems. It was extremely successful, The main themes were

- Heterogeneous random media, at high frequency, and identification

- High contrast elliptic systems

- Imaging: invisibility and hybrid imaging methods

- Numerical methods for high frequency problems



Special attention was devoted to new models and problems coming from physics leading to innovative imaging methods. The proceedings of the workshop have been published in the Contemporary Mathematics series of the American Mathematical Society, an international peer-reviewed publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One potential use is seismic imaging. In fact one of the methods presented correctly predicted a seismic event. Other areas of applications are the imaging of liquid crystals, and the development of 'invisibility cloaks', that is, 

ways to make obstacles not inferere with electromagnetic waves. This worskhop was about accurate imaging of complex media, and (a contrario) invisibility: the methods and results either presented during the workshop or published in the proceedings can be put to use to improve the imaging methods currently used.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>219389EA-72B7-40F8-BE86-8480937CE03B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5706310817.698306774758e4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www0.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/oxpde/events/multi-scale-and-high-contrast-pde</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I028668/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
