In 2013, the Public Health Outcomes Framework for England included an indicator of mortality associated with air pollution, further demonstrating its recognised importance as a major environmental risk to health. It is essential, therefore that effective mechanisms are developed to ensure that the high quality air pollution research carried out by the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), the UK's largest funder of independent environmental science research, is appropriately communicated to and informed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who are the government department responsible for this issue. 

While there are existing processes to facilitate the communication of air pollution research to Defra, mounting evidence of the costs of air pollution on UK public health strongly favour an increasing scale of interactions between research and policy. With continuing pressure to deliver scientific evidence for policy more efficiently, there is both the need and opportunity to improve the use of existing mechanisms and to develop new channels and tools for more effective communication of research to policy and the reciprocal transfer of evidence needs from Defra to the research community. This fellowship will facilitate effective communication between the UK atmospheric science research community and Defra's Atmosphere and Industrial Emissions Team (AIE), extending existing mechanisms to develop longer-term and more sustainable working relationships between these two groups and increasing the potential for impact from NERC air quality research in UK government, public policy and Europe.

The primary aim is to promote co-production of research and to increase awareness of the evidence needs of policy to provide increased policy impact from NERC science. The activities focus around getting NERC atmospheric researchers and Defra's Atmosphere and Industrial Emissions team together in situations that facilitate knowledge exchange, discussion of research priorities and opportunities, and relationship building, without creating unnecessary burdens on time or resources. As part of the NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science programme of meetings, fora will be organised for researchers and policy-makers to discuss policy relevant atmospheric science and the future of research in these crucial areas of science. Workshops and dedicated sessions will also be organised at key meetings and conferences and seminars will be delivered at UK universities that carry out NERC air pollution research. An effective mechanism already used by Defra to synthesise the vast and complex research base for air quality is the Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG). AQEG are an Expert Committee that provides independent scientific advice on air quality to Defra and the Devolved Administrations. The fellowship will aim to increase the visibility of AQEG and its outputs to maximise the value of this resource for communicating air quality evidence to policy-makers. 

This fellowship aims to provide greater awareness from the NERC community of Defra's air quality evidence needs and an improvement in Defra's access to the high quality research being carried out by NERC. Through this work effective networks can be built and maintained enabling long-term knowledge exchange across the policy-science interface maximising the UK's ability to produce cutting-edge air quality research with policy relevance and to realise the potential benefit for society.

This provides Defra with better access to advice and evidence to support air quality policy. Improvements in air quality policy has an influence on the societal impact of this environmental issue which is associated with serious health impacts and therefore also economic impacts.

As a direct result of the forum in 2016 Defra officials now have regular teleconferences with the NERC lead for the Environment and Health portfolio. This is improving communication of evidence needs and priorities and discussion of opportunities for collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90e60917574.41290674-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Defra have committed to allow and encourage officials to attend the fora, present evidence needs at the fora and to consider this an important opportunity to engage with the research community and build partnerships and relationships.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Agreed with NCAS Science Strategy Board to run a pilot Science Policy Forum on air quality in May 2016. The purpose of the forum was to discuss recent developments in air quality research, policy implications and future directions for air quality research, as well as to build relationships between the research community and Defra officials. I developed the concept, approached speakers, agreed the programme and format with NCAS SSB and Defra senior officials and invited attendees. NCAS provided administrative support for meeting organisation. The first forum took place in May 2016 and was well attended by academic researchers and Defra officials. I submitted a report on the forum and my proposal for this to become a regular commitment on the NCAS programme of fora to NCAS SSB and commitment to future fora was agreed. The next forum is planned for September 2017.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department For Environment, Food And Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Initiated links with the Defra partnership team</gtr:description><gtr:id>844319AA-4DA2-4E4E-B068-B475340D72FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None realised as yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9175b69cf48.71784293-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contribution to discussions, provides the link to wider Defra allowing potential for impact beyond just the air quality team.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have had numerous meetings and conversations with a member of the Defra partnerships Team around ways to engage with the research community, develop links and get access to evidence.

This also provides an horizon scanning opportunity giving the Defra team an idea of the issues that researchers are prioritising. Over the past year (2016/17) the Defra air quality team have increasingly been using my links with and knowledge of the research community to identify members of the community who can be approached for advice or to carry out work.
