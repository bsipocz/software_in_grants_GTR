soil quality and resilience to climatic extremes and land use changes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M017044/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Only 30% of Earth's surface is land, only 9% is cultivated, and there is little scope for future expansion. The supply of water and nutrients from soil to crops in approximately 7800 km3 of topsoil (to 0.5 m) currently sustains 7 billion humans. This soil resource is the essential foundation of arable farming on which plant production for food, fiber and biofuels, and ultimately the entire global economy depends. How we manage this vital, life sustaining, resource will determine the quality of life and Earth's carrying capacity for future generations. 

SoilBioHedge addresses the central problem for soil security: continuous conventional arable cultivation depletes soil organic matter, degrades soil structure, reduces water drainage and water holding capacity, and increases the susceptibility of soil and crops to the impacts of climatic stress through decreased resilience to flood and drought conditions.

We will test our central hypothesis: grass-clover leys sown into arable fields and connected to hedgerows and unploughed grassy margins enable key ecosystem-engineers (earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi) to recolonize the fields, restoring and improving soil quality compared to leys unconnected to field margins. 

We will determine for the first time the importance of connectivity from biodiversity refugia under hedgerows to arable fields via grass-clover leys in restoring functional biodiversity. We will quantify soil quality as functional benefits from soil-organism interactions: increases in soil organic matter, water-stable macroaggregates, water holding capacity, infiltration rates, drought and flood resilience, and resulting crop yields. We will quantify the operational temporal and spatial scales for ecosystem engineers (grass-clover roots, AM fungi, and earthworms) and soil functions to synergistically develop with land use and management change. We will transform mechanistic understanding of soil structure dynamics by combined metabolomics and metagenomic analyses tracking soil aggregate formation over 3 growing seasons. 

Our research design includes three nested scales of observation. 
1) Hedge-to-Field Experiments at Leeds U. farm to quantify spatial/temporal changes in soil functions and biodiversity, arising from arable-to-ley conversion strips that are disconnected or connected to the field margin, and across a whole field converted to arable in 2012, and ley-to-arable conversion using conventional vs. minimal tillage strips and a field that converted to ley in 2009. Monolith mesocosm studies will use turf blocks removed from the experimental plots, treated with herbicide and direct drilled with wheat. We will compare crop yields between the field and monoliths maintained at near-ambient conditions, under simulated drought and excess rainfall causing flooding. The results will quantify soil quality and the resilience of the crop and soil organisms and functions to these stresses. 
2) Landscape-Scale Hedge-to-Field Transects will quantify soil functional changes on long-term arable fields and pairs of arable fields converted to ley over 2 differing time scales. We will utilize our network of &amp;gt;100 farms that provide a range of soil types, and management (conventional, organic, and minimal tillage). 
3) Field-to-Landscape Scale mathematical modelling to establish an integrative and predictive spatiotemporal model of soil quality change at field-to-landscape-scale, including the role of dispersal of hedgerow and field margin biodiversity into arable land resulting from land use and management change involving leys. We will integrate mechanistic understanding of soil aggregation and carbon accumulation through the synergistic actions of roots, AM, and earthworms from our experiments and landscape-scale transect observations with existing Countryside Survey data and national digital soil map, to deliver a step-change in understanding for sustainable soil management policy and practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit and how? 
Results from SoilBioHedge, and their practical applications in sustainable soil management by UK and international farmers have potential to deliver far-reaching benefits across a wide range of sectors, from individuals and organizations, to societal benefits from long-term potential gains in soil and food security. 
Pre- and post-farmgate stakeholders and policymakers. The core outcomes of the project will directly influence a) Farmers, farm managers: benefit through understanding benefits of leys and the spatiotemporal scales over which they restore soil quality under different management practices and soil types, b) Statutory agencies involved in water and soil conservation (e.g. Natural England, Environment Agency), c) Utility companies involved in water supply, nitrate pollution and management of stormwater and associated sediment discharges, d) households in flood-risk areas where the risks have been increased by loss of arable soil water infiltration and storage capacity, e) Game and Wildlife Conservation, (f) Government policy makers (DEFRA) and via the SoilTrEC project network EC and member state agencies tasked with policy innovation for EU soil security, g) The wider UK and international public via the SCOPE Soil Carbon project network including dissemination activities of the UN Environment Programme, European Soil Bureau web portal, and UN FAO (via the Global Soils Partnership) - all specifically aimed at improved soil and food security and environmental sustainability, consistent with the aims and vision of the global food security (GFS) programme

We will employ 4 major mechanisms of communication and engagement:
1. National and international conference presentations, including: International Conference on Mycorrhiza, British Soil Science Society, British Ecological Society, International Earthworm Ecology Symposium, The European and American Geophysical Union, US and European Goldschmidt Conferences.
2. Publications in high impact and / or open access peer reviewed journals. We plan to submit at least 6 major journal articles over the course of the project. These publications will reach academic audiences, and via press releases and open access publication enable wide impact.
3. Knowledge and information transfer to national databases on earthworms, AM fungi and tipulid biodiversity and distributions.
4. Stakeholder and Outreach Events. We will have 4 major stakeholder engagement activities: a) Our steering group stakeholders (see letters of support) will meet with us annually (see Workflow Plan and Project Management document) for all three years of the project, guiding our strategies for effective engagement with the stakeholder groups they represent. b) We will hold a 3-day public engagement event &amp;quot;Hedge-to-Field: What's hiding under your hedge and why is it important for our soil?&amp;quot; at the Great Yorkshire Show 2017 which typically has &amp;gt;130,000 visitors over 3 days). c) Host a 1 day outreach/engagement meeting in the project's final year to demonstrate research outcomes and communicate findings to farmers and key policy makers, following the successful model we used in a meeting co-hosted with the Organic Growers Alliance and facilitated by the Technology Strategy Board Environmental Sustainability Knowledge Transfer. d) Contribute to a meeting with a wider stakeholder group with interests in wheat breeding and sustainable cultivation methods, hosted at the Allerton Project Visitor's Center and drawing on their extensive network of contacts (see Dr AR Leake letter of support).

Dissemination materials for the above series of events will be distilled into 2-page Fact Sheets/Policy briefs that summarize key findings and provide advice for farmers and soil management practitioners and the agritech commercial supply chain, and provide key science evidence to support policy innovation for government agencies and NGOs working at the science-policy interface.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>666112</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>759127EB-2247-4646-AF08-C08A03942DDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing winter-cover crop trials of effects on mycorrhization.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dafad60c2ba7.85413691-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Given the strong complementarity of the SoilBioHedge project to the current goals and activities of the Trust, we are able to offer considerable in-kind support for this project.

Invitation to visit Thriplow Farms (David Walston) to discuss sustainable soil management in arable farming- including no-tillage, leys, organic matter earthworms and mycorrhiza. This invitation was a follow-up to their visit to Sheffield earlier in the year at which I gave a presentation on MycoRhizaSiol and SoilBioHedge projects, our work on cover-crops and mycorrhiza with Kelloggs. The farm visit was a great chance for direct knowledge exchange with farmers- both learning from them and their experiences with no-tillage arable farming and use of leys, as well as us being able to explain how some of their actions are enhancing soil quality by visual assessments and key indicators such as earthworms and soil crumb structure. Follow up to this includes requests for us to undertake some soil analyses to help confirm how no-tillage is improving soil functions, and contacts made on this day are providing farms which we will sample as part of SoilBioHedge landscape-scale studies. This meeting and engagement directly with farmers and land managers is part of our formal commitment to knowledge exchange from this project (integral to our pathways to impact) and the relationships and contacts we are building in the farming and agricultural advisory sector is vital for developing an effective pipeline for the knowledge transfer once our major research findings and applications such as user-tools are available.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c834353aba74.87174573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Leeds University Farm User Group Meeting 2nd August 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>777B87BD-C68F-42FE-A0C7-FF9838BE3C98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Leeds University Farm User Group Meeting, Hazelwood Castle, 2nd August 2016.

Invited talk: Challenges to assessing and maintaining soil health in the context of short-term tenancies. 12th October 2016. Halifax Hall Sheffield. This presentation was followed up by the Crown Estate with further meetings to discuss research needs with respect to assessing and maintaining soil health in the context of short-term tenancies, and a series of follow-up activities have taken place. The invited talk integrated the early results from MycoRhizaSoil and SoilBioHedge research projects and the associated work with Kelloggs on cover-cropping and mycorrhizas to consider how crop rotations and soil management such as different intensities of tillage can impact soil quality and its legacy effects in the context of short-term tenancies, and the problems of loss of soil organic matter from arable soils under continuous cultivation, again demonstrated by our research. These findings and our work developing measures of soil quality such as bioassays and hedge-to-field soil quality benchmarking are of interest to the Crown Estate in the context on maintaining long-term capital values of the estate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8371d6e86f8.31765931</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cereals 2016 Oral presentation and formal written report to Kelloggs Origins Cover Crop Farmer group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D645EA4-6590-4B3D-88FD-E0FEAD2928E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation &amp;quot;Mycorrhizas in winter cover crops&amp;quot; and formal written report (with graphics and pictures) to Kelloggs Origins Cover Crop Farmer group at Cereals event 16 June in Cambridgeshire in collaboration with NIAB (Dr Ron Stobart) This was providing group and personalized feed-back to the participating farmers who had trialed different winter cover-crop systems in 2015-16, and from which I coordinated sampling of both the cover crop and follow-on crops for assessment of mycorrhiza.

This has communicated the impacts of arable farming on soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Arising from these presentations has been an ongoing collaboration with Kelloggs Origins group farmers experimenting with winter-cover crops to improve soil quality in collaboration with NIAB, with 6 farms involved in these trials in 2015-16. This has enabled us to build a highly effective impact pathway to farmers and land managers joint research on their land, reporting our finding back to them (Kellogg's Origins), and through group meetings presentations and farm visits with farmers (Asda Pathfinders, Kellogg's Origins). Our research has also fed into our written evidence submitted to the Government Inquiry into soil health, particularly our concerns about the loss of soil organic matter and soil compaction in arable land, and our concerns about the lack of effective monitoring and lack of protection for UK arable soils. 

Our research findings demonstrating the effectiveness of leys in soil quality restoration, and the biological functional improvements in soil structure, mycorrhization, earthworm populations and soil water storage capacity have far-reaching implications in UK arable farming and downstream consequences such as flood risk management. The Involvement of Jonathan Leake in the recently funded &amp;pound;4.6M NERC Yorkshire iCASP consortium as the Academic Lead for Sustainable Agriculture &amp;amp; Communications, provides a clear pathway for him to assist delivering impacts of the larger scale benefits from field-to-landscape-to large catchment scales.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FA280852-3298-4760-BD48-AD50B2AC4B04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56daef72812274.49087037</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Two key findings have already come from the research- we have found substantial soil drying associated with hedgerows - which has potentially important implications for their roles as buffer-zones at field margins reducing runoff.
