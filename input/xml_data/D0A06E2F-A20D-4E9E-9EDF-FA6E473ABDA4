HAART has led to dramatic decreases in the number of patients dying from HIV and AIDS. However, some of these drugs can cause severe side effects, including heart disease. It is not known whether some drugs are more likely to cause this than others. 

When comparing the rate of heart disease in those receiving different drugs, we must remember that patients prescribed a particular drug may differ from those prescribed another drug. Patients already at high risk of heart disease (because of their age, sex, or family history) may be selectively given drugs that are not thought to be linked to heart disease. Also, these patients may have more regular cholesterol tests than those thought to be at lower risk. As many approaches to the analysis of these data rely on the fact that similar amounts of information are available from all patients, there is a potential that the results may be unreliable. 

The aim of this project is to investigate methods that can give a reliable assessment of whether different HIV drugs have a different effect on the development of heart disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background:
Since the mid-1990s, HIV-positive patients in developed countries have been treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although the effects of HAART on HIV-related morbidity and mortality have been dramatic, several studies have demonstrated detrimental changes in lipids and an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) amongst those receiving HAART, particularly amongst those receiving the protease inhibitor (PI) class of antiretrovirals. However, within this class of drugs, there are likely to be differences between the individual drugs in their propensity to cause CVD. 

Aim and objectives:
The aim of this project is to investigate the potential for statistical bias, particularly channelling bias, when investigating the association between specific antiretroviral drugs and the occurrence of CVD, and to develop methods to minimise these biases. As patients with HIV often have very complex treatment histories, with many treatment changes, this project will consider each patient?s full HAART history, rather than only their first-line treatment (an approach common in other studies) and will also need to take account of missing data and informative censoring, as patients change treatments.
 
Design:
The project will be performed using a number of cohort studies and collaborations, including the Royal Free Hospital Cohort, the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) Study, and the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study. Such studies are particularly useful when addressing the association between specific antiretroviral drugs and CVD (controlled trials would require prohibitively large sample sizes and follow-up periods), but these study designs are particularly prone to bias. 

Methodology:
There are likely to be a number of potential sources of bias present when assessing the association between specific antiretroviral drugs and the development of CVD. As the data are observational there is the pottial for channelling bias. Additionally, data on important confounders may often be missing (non-randomly), and informative censoring may occur if patients and clinicians make rapid treatment changes in those who appear to be at high risk of CVD. Methods to account for these biases will be investigated.

Scientific and medical opportunities of the study:
The benefits of HAART will be weakened if patients are unable to tolerate their medication or die from other non-AIDS causes as a result of treatment. The association between specific antiretrovirals and CVD remains unclear, and few studies have taken account of the potential biases that may be present. Thus, any findings from this study would have immediate clinical value.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239396</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66A88388-E006-4D96-8DE7-263F7F42D6A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Trends in underlying causes of death in people with HIV from 1999 to 2011 (D:A:D): a multicohort collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2859f4b6c674aac6f0822025826c8b39"><gtr:id>2859f4b6c674aac6f0822025826c8b39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>nZ8FBjseuxe</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33CB28E9-9228-499B-9A72-278B9C18D577</gtr:id><gtr:title>Factors associated with specific causes of death amongst HIV-positive individuals in the D:A:D Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AIDS (London, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aab29f872b819d696459f8eb357638b7"><gtr:id>aab29f872b819d696459f8eb357638b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV drugs (D:A:D) Study Group</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0269-9370</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>k7eeWn1vsco</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0701639</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>B7F5A9CA-62C7-4E68-A2B2-3D6CCA85E16B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>7.3  Management and decision making</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
