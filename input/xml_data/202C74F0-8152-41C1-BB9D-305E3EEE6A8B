(E4)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N000498/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>It is widely accepted that early life influences shape our development and health and behavioural outcomes across the life course. Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly implicated in these complex interactions and provide a key to understanding (i) what aspects of our environment impact upon gene regulation, (ii) how our environment and way of living become embodied in human biology, over what timeframe and with what degree of persistence and (iii) how social and biological inequality may influence development and health.

This project builds upon a substantial foundation of epigenetic research in richly characterised longitudinal cohort studies to explore these concepts of environment, embodiment and inequality. We will utilise the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which currently has the most extensive collection of longitudinal epigenetic data of any birth cohort study in the world, as a platform to address these concepts and through collaboration with seven other cohorts we will extend our investigations across the entire lifecourse to understand how different social and environmental experiences in early life operate to influence epigenetic signatures and downstream outcomes. We will extend these analyses by implementing causal analysis methods, including novel applications of Mendelian randomization, to strengthen causal inference in the associations we observe. Further, we will apply social constructs/theories to elaborate these interpretations.

Analysis of the role of epigenetic processes in linking the environment with development and health across the lifecourse requires the capacity to generate, analyse and interpret complex data. The high dimensional, dynamic characteristics of epigenetic data require advanced competencies in bioinformatics and statistical methods. We have invested considerable effort in generating epigenetic data, developing and refining informatics and statistical skills over recent years and through this project propose to apply them to the questions outlined above.
The proposed work will extend current research activities, drawing together skills of social and biological scientists to apply recently developed methodologies to unresolved issues at the interface of epigenetics and social science. A major component of project activities will be the promotion of inter-disciplinary collaboration, training opportunities and widespread dissemination of both methods and scientific outputs. We will draw upon the expertise of our co-investigator team in bioinformatics, computational science, econometrics, education, epigenetics, lifecourse epidemiology, psychology, quantitative genetics, social science and statistics to execute the proposed project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary academic beneficiaries of this project will be social scientists and biological scientists who will gain insight into the role of the epigenome and the social environment. We aim to exploit the recent developments from established programmes of research in applied epigenetics in the medical sciences to inform advances in social science epigenetics. We will facilitate a deeper understanding of the technical, biological and bioinformatic aspects of epigenetic research for the social science community. Simultaneously the biological and biotechnological scientists involved in the programme will gain a deeper insight into social science issues and methods, in particular the theoretical constructs and statistical approaches applied in this field.

Academic benefits will be gained through scientific interaction in the execution of specific hypothesis-driven project work. Communication between social and biological domains will be facilitated by a dedicated member of the research team. Training activities will serve our multi-disciplinary team as well as a much wider audience of workshop and symposium participants. Researchers in the field of lifecourse epidemiology will benefit from a clearer understanding of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the programming of later health and behaviours. 

Many collaborators from a wide range of social and biological backgrounds have expressed their enthusiastic support for the project. Their affiliations and research interests are listed in the appended Table of Supporting Collaborators. Mutual benefit will be gained through, for example, enhancement of cohort output, discussion of theoretical frameworks and the evolution of new hypotheses. 

A range of genetic and epigenetic consortia will interface with the project and will benefit from methodological developments, data harmonization and data sharing. In particular, cohorts and consortia with genetic data but without epigenetic data will have the opportunity to engage in epigenetic studies through the use of Mendelian randomization which uses genetic proxies for DNA methylation measures. This will facilitate use of data to address questions pertinent to the role of epigenetics, without the investment in DNA methylation data generation, and results from exploiting complementary data sets and collaborative working.

Academics at all career stages, from PhD students to senior academics will have the opportunity to engage with and benefit from the research proposed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>669634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GenExp</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE)</gtr:description><gtr:id>B59BE65B-9A8B-41EA-9A27-E664843F0BFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joubert, BR, et al DNA Methylation in Newborns and Maternal Smoking in Pregnancy: Genome-wide Consortium Meta-analysis.

Projects led/co-led by UoB:
Maternal smoking; led by Bonnie Joubert (MoBa) and others including Rebecca Richmond (UoB)
Maternal BMI; led by Gemma Sharp (UoB) and Janine Felix (Generation R).
Childhood BMI; led by Janine Felix (Generation R) and others including Gemma Sharp (UoB) 
Pre-eclampsia/Maternal hypertension; led by Nabila Kazmi (UoB) and Marie-France Hivert (Harvard)
Eczema; led by Lavinia Paternoster (UoB) and Generation R
Lung Function; led by UoB (Kim Burrows, John Henderson) and Generation R

Collaboration between PACE and CHARGE - Prenatal alcohol exposure and cord blood DNA methylation; led by Luisa Zuccolo, Gemma Sharp (UoB) and Janine Felix (Generation R). Chunyu Lui (NIH) is leading the CHARGE+ consortium meta-analysis of own alcohol exposure/own DNA methylation and we are planning a reciprocal look-up of results. CHARGE+ is a large consortium initially formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication opportunities among multiple large and well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort studies. CHARGE+ now additionally facilitate epigenome-wide meta-analyses.

Projects with contributions from UoB:
Maternal thyroid function; led by Generation R, with input from Pete Taylor (UoB). Plans for a follow-up paper led by UoB (Gemma Sharp and Tamsin Sharp).

Birth weight; led by GECKO, with contribution of results from Gemma Sharp (UoB)

Abstract:
Many environmental exposures particularly in early development are known to influence later health outcomes. Unfortunately records of exposure tend to be based on self-report long after the exposure has occurred and therefore lack precision and objectivity. A possible solution is to infer exposure from stable, accessible biomarkers. DNA methylation measured in peripheral tissues is a promising candidate because it is commonly measured in many human cohort studies and is known to retain associations with certain exposures for many years. As a proof of principle, we created proxies for prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) using cord blood DNA methylation levels. We then asked how well the proxies correlate with PTE and well-known outcomes of PTE. We were indeed able to derive accurate DNA methylation proxies for PTE and showed that accuracy could be improved by including certain data preprocessing steps as well as including association effect information from large meta-analyses of PTE in DNA methylation. Our proxies also related to known PTE outcomes similarly to PTE but did identify cases of collider bias introduced by certain data preprocessing steps. In future we will further investigate approaches for improving proxy accuracy and preventing collider bias.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>587f6295a31d27.68982706</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/epigenetics-social-science-network/news/2016/-dna-methylation-proxy-for-exposure-and-outcome-prediction.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Statistical approaches for epigenetics workshop Bristol</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>550BBA09-BA77-48A0-8B73-62606CD8D3F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>31 academics from across the UK attended this event.

All eight research projects were presented, and discussion followed regarding how the ESRC and BBSRC epigenetics community might provide mutual support including through data sharing, a shared calendar of events, resource sharing, networking opportunities for early career researchers and effective communication within the group. Following the event research collaborations have been established and a network website has been produced which allows the group to have a central method of communication.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>587f4d99825f62.12860402</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/epigenetics-social-science-network/news/2016/epigenetics-and-social-science-network-launch-event.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>From genes to genomes in middle years biology (Neil Ingram)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B33C6D1D-050B-4D1F-9822-542E14787B95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Neil Ingram spoke at the Association of Science Education conference at the University of Reading in a talk entitled 'From genes to genomes in middle years biology'.
