Ideally the surgeon wishes to take bone from one area (donor site) to another area (recipient site) to support the operation they are performing. However, a patient's own donor bone is in short supply and its removal can lead to complications in the donor site. This means the surgeon will often recourse to allograft - decellularised (and thus biologically inferior) - bone from other people. A third, and growing, option is synthetic graft. Synthetic graft can be made from biologically active materials, but is not viable and thus not yet as good as living bone. 
Our bioreactor, that supplies nanoscale 'kicks' to cells in culture can be used to convert mesenchymal stem cells (the stem cells of the bone, simple to isolate from a patient's iliac crest or fat tissue) to bone forming osteoblasts. It can achieve this with cells seeded into 3D environments such as gels or potentially synthetic graft materials. This thus allows us to envisage supply of living bone graft derived from a patient's own cells. The ability to supply such materials would provide a new gold standard for bone grafting.
In this project we will thus develop our bioreactor into a flexible platform for study of bone regeneration (which will also be of significant interest to many academic labs in the field) and provision of bone graft. 

Further to this vision of tissue engineered bone supply, there is also a big need in Pharma for relevant bone models to reduce use of both standard lab models that are very dissimilar to the in-body environment and animal testing which has large cost and ethical consideration. Our ability to produce 3D bone in the lab simply, reproducibly, at low cost and without need for chemical control of cell phenotype (we will just use the nanokicks) will provide an excellent model for testing of drugs for e.g. osteoporosis, osteogenesis imperfecta and other bone conditions. In this project, we will use our technique to study 3D bone formation in the lab and look at what metabolites, the basic building blocks of life, the cell use as they form bone. We will then identify bioactive metabolites and validate them in our bone mimics.

Finally, we will test to see feasibility of applying nanokicks to humans to help treat e.g. spinal injury, slow bone repair and osteoporosis etc. We will move from mechanical nanokicks to acoustic nanokicks to achieve this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Scientists and Healthcare Professionals
We will use open access publishing to disseminate as broadly as possible. This will be of direct interest to the biomaterials, tissue engineering, stem cells, pharma and medical communities. 

Laboratories
There are a range of bioreactors available to academic laboratories including mechanical (eg BOSE, EBERS), perfusion (eg BOSE, Minucell) and rotary (eg Synthecon). All have drawbacks for bone production ranging from affordability, sterility, usability and functional outcome. Our system's advantage is that it uses standard cell culture consumables and thus standard protocols. This will clearly open up 3D bone research to many more labs.

Industry
In the first instance our work will be of interest to industrialists working in the mechanotransduction (bioreactor), material science (synthetic bioactive graft) and cell culture plastics manufacture areas. We will develop a bioreactor, consumables for it and try to move to use synthetic tissue engineering scaffolds for our 3D bone graft. Companies working in this area include those with interest in bioreactors (e.g. BOSE, EBERS, Minuth, Synthecon etc), providers of innovative cell cultureware and tissue engineering scaffolds (e.g. BiogelX, Stem Cell Technologies, Porvair and Nunc) and technology developers such as Linn and Physik Instrumente. These companies would have economic benefit from co-developing, licensing and exploiting our bioreactors and consumables for them. Secondly, we will appeal to Pharma with our novel mass spectrometry approaches to drug design (e.g. GSK). Thirdly, we will appeal to companies with an interest in advanced technologies, such as Genzyme and Advanced Tissue Solutions, who will be interested in tissue engineering approaches to bone graft. Finally we will develop an entirely new apparatus for acoustic nanokicking that could be developed to a handheld device for use in clinic. For this, companies with interests in precision signalling will be approached (e.g. Linn).

Patients
Bone graft is the second most transplanted tissue after blood. Autograft harvest from e.g. the iliac crest has a range of associated complications including herniation, instability, nerve damage, infection, deep hematoma requiring surgical intervention and pain [1]. Synthetic bone graft is increasing in use but is biologically inferior and tends to be used with BMP (e.g. Infuse)[2]. BMP has to be used in high doses [3] and this has led to serious respiratory, neurological and inflammatory complications and the issuing of a public health warning by the FDA [4]. Subsequently, reports of the carcinogenic potential of BMP have been noted. The development of tissue engineered bone graft with good volume (cms3) would be a major advantage. All surgeons we have surveyed strongly agree there is urgent unmet need.

Health Service Providers
- Delivery of tissue engineered bone graft would reduce the need for two surgeries. This would represent a saving on surgical time and could be competitively placed compared to e.g. BMP treatment, which can cost up to &amp;pound;3k per patient in non-union fixation [4].
- Delivery of novel drugs for bone conditions. We will identify bioactive metabolites to aid with bone repair and e.g. osteoporosis. Our model could also be used to test 3rd party drugs, conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta and to advise personal therapies.
- Delivery of novel clinical instruments for bone regeneration i.e. acoustic nanokicking.

Public
Our work will raise interest in science, increasing awareness of the scientific challenges of supporting an aging population. We will engage with the next generation of scientists to inspire them to overcome the burden and limitations of bone grafting and bone regeneration.
