Special Lagrangian submanifolds are high-dimensional geometric objects, discovered by geometers in 1982, that exist within special types of spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds. Because of this, special Lagrangians are difficult to describe in immediately intuitive ways. However, they are exotic cousins of the everyday soap film. Mathematicians have studied the soap film or minimal surface equations since the 1700s and the tools they developed have gone on to play important roles across maths and the physical sciences. To give one prominent example, Lagrange invented the Calculus of Variations largely to study soap films.Initially, mathematicians studied special Lagrangians solely because of their remarkable geometric properties. However, in an unexpected development, in the mid 90s they appeared in String Theory, as a special type of brane---a higher-dimensional membrane-like object, as opposed to a 1-dimensional string. Based on physical intuition about branes, string theorists made surprising predictions about special Lagrangians, giving their mathematical study further impetus and stimulating work aimed at verifying these predictions.However, major mathematical obstacles arise because families of smooth special Lagrangians can be become badly behaved and form singularities. A smooth geometric object, like the sphere, when viewed at ever-increasing magnification begin to look flatter and flatter, approaching a fixed plane called the tangent plane. When a geometric object has singularities, there may be regions which, however much they are magnified, never become flat like a plane; the tip of an ordinary cone is a good example.This proposal aims to study the properties of singular special Lagrangians in order to resolve (a) whether the predictions from String Theory are correct and (b) whether it is possible to define an invariant of Calabi-Yau spaces by counting the number of certain kinds of special Lagrangians. If the singularities of special Lagrangians are too badly behaved then it will not be possible to ``count'' special Lagrangians in a useful way.A crucial aspect of the proposal is to develop a theory of typical k-dimensional families of special Lagrangians in typical (almost) Calabi-Yau manifolds and to understand what kinds of singularities can occur in these typical families. Recent research has shown that the singularities of special Lagrangians are very varied indeed and so the 'typical' assumption is crucial to help us cut down the number of ways that singularities form. A major technical problem we must overcome is that prior to making the `typical' assumption there are classes of singular special Lagrangians we might have to consider that are not currently under good geometric or analytic control. We must eventually either establish better geometric and analytic control of very general special Lagrangian singularities or else find a way to argue that special Lagrangians singularities that behave very badly are very far from `typical'. We expect that such a theory of typical singularities would have a big impact not just in special Lagrangian geometry but also in many other neighbouring parts of Geometry and possibly beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1042334</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main accomplishments of the research are difficult to describe clearly in non technical terms since they are mainly advances in differential geometry of high dimensinal spaces studied using methods from nonlinear partial differential equations. The impact of our research has mainly been within the differential geometry and theoretical physics communities. 

We proved the existence of close to 1 billion 7-dimensional spaces with very special geometric properties (manifolds with G2 holonomy). Previously only a few hundred examples of such spaces were known. These spaces are of deep interest to differential geometers and to theoretical physicists trying to study models for all the fundamental forces for the universe (String and M-theory). They provide special types of so-called Einstein manifolds, that satisfy equations related to the equations that arise for solutions to Einstein's theory of General Relativity in vacuum. In M-theory the properties of these 7-dimensional spaces encode important physical properties of the universe (the spectrum of fundamental particles in physics for example). 

Another breakthrough was to be able to give practical criteria to determine when two of these special geometric structures could actually be defined on the same underlying space (possibly by having to warp these spaces in very complicated, difficult to visualise ways). No such criteria was known for any of the previous examples of such geometric structures. Our research therefore cast new light on the global structure of the space of all such special geometric structures that can be given on a given 7-dimensional space. This has already stimulated further research developments (inlcuding by former members of my research team) that shows that by an extension of our methods of construction there are at least some 7-dimensional spaces where there is no way to deform smoothly from one of our special geometric structures to another. Studying this phenomenon more closely is expected to be important both in differential geometry and in its applications to M-theory.

Other significant developments including new tools and new models for the study of ways in which various types of geometric structures --- especially special Lagrangian submanifolds, a special type of geometric objects that is an exotic high-dimensional cousin of everyday soap films-- and so-called Calabi-Yau spaces --- other spaces related to vacuum solutions of Einstein's equations that play a fundamental role in String Theory--- can degenerate in families and develop singularities. Singularity formation in nonlinear partial differential equations is a huge area which is still only partly understood. When these equations describe special types of geometric structures these equations often have a special character and one can use geometric intuition to gain insight into these equations and conversely use analytic methods to gain new geometric insight. This provides new insights and new methods about singularity structure in nonlinear PDEs in more general settings. More technically, the main results concerned the construction and classification of new singular special Lagrangian n-folds (especially cones) and new asymptotically conical and cylindrical Calabi-Yau spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research findings are already being taken forward both by former members of my research team (several of whom have now have research positions or permanent academic positions) and by other researchers in differential geometry and theoretical physics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E5E9A4B-C7E8-4901-BE80-9ED4B857BA0A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464b9616a3bd9.49317504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.haskins</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6C942EF-1BDC-42E3-984E-10657B7868FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Closed twisted products and $\sorth{p}\times \sorth{q}$-invariant special Lagrangian cones</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Analysis and Geometry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/700e229b06dae380f63d121c0c5c7301"><gtr:id>700e229b06dae380f63d121c0c5c7301</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haskins M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464a687f20063.02801906</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A8456E9-A7D0-4431-88DA-84BFC53315BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau 3-folds from weak Fano 3-folds</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geometry &amp; Topology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/383b558332425040c7dd5bff7f89e9b9"><gtr:id>383b558332425040c7dd5bff7f89e9b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Corti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464a5d8c8d084.49545050</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B3231A6-2E3F-46A0-A384-E2B0BF6650B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The geometry of SO(
