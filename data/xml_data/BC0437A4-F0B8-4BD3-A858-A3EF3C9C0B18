such as the UK's now redundant fleet of Magnox reactors, or responding to a nuclear incident
such as Fukushima Dai-Ichi.
This cost is driven by radioactivity and radiation. Radioactive wastes are expensive to
process, store and dispose. Radiation prevents or limits man access to areas, turning simple
manual tasks into complex remote operations. Controlling costs is about consistently selecting
the best decommissioning option. This in turn is about knowledge; where uncertainty exists
pessimistic decisions are made resulting in unnecessarily complex solutions and overcategorisation
of waste.
We understand this need, both through our own long-standing experience in nuclear
decommissioning in the UK and through the technology R&amp;amp;D roadmaps - known as TBURDs
- maintained by the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA) and its Site Licensee
Companies (SLCs). At Sellafield, which constitutes the majority of the UK legacy the
TBURD identifies that a gamma camera that can be deployed through small apertures is a key
technology gap in the decommissioning plans for several major facilities.
There are other, less obvious reasons why gamma cameras are under-utilised. They are
typically seen as expensive, unwieldy pieces of equipment with a high cost of use and burden
of ownership. In most cases, the equipment is maintained by a service provider who provides
both equipment and expert operators and consultants to interpret outputs at daily charge - this
model prohibits 'casual' use of the gamma cameras to confirm assumptions or characterise
minor problems which is potentially one of the most valuable applications of the technology.
Our vision is to develop a gamma camera that is easy and convenient to use and which, with
very limited user training, can produce rich, high value virtual environments that can be used
conveniently by anyone to understand their radiation environment. Where more advanced
analysis is required, this will be available as a retrospective consultancy service.
This business model has significant advantages over existing gamma camera services for both
customer and service provider:
The cost of use by SLCs is minimal, which means that gamma cameras can be freely applied
on a routine basis. This brings benefits to the SLC because it improves understanding of the
causes of high radiation areas at limited additional effort and cost.
New applications for consultancy service are opened up, because routine applications will
inevitably identify previously unknown problems requiring a more sophisticated analysis.
The technology that we will develop in this project enables this business model in three ways:
- it will produce a small gamma camera capable of being deployed through small apertures
- it will be fast, light, and easy to use.
- it have a 'point and squirt' operation and an intuitive display enabling use by non-expert
users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710001</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
