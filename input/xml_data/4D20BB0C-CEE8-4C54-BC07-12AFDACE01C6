criminal justice system. If there is a real increase in these antisocial behaviours, is this a result of pre-service factors, such as early disadvantage and antisocial behaviour, or military service
factors, such as combat trauma? Mental illness and substance misuse may also play important roles. Without understanding the different risk factors for offending in the Armed Forces, it is difficult to make policy recommendations regarding treatment/prevention services. In order to address these questions, data will be used from an ongoing study of UK military personnel in which information has been collected via questionnaire on aggressive behaviour as well as background information on demographics and health and behaviours before and after deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan. We will also link our data with that of the Ministry of Justice in order to get official conviction records as a reliable measure of offending behaviour. Aggression and offending in those who were deployed will be compared to those who were not. Factors associated with changes in level of violence/criminality in the deployed group will also be explored.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: There is concern that an alleged rise in aggression/criminality in military personnel returning from deployment in Iraq/Afghanistan may increase pressures on the NHS and Criminal Justice System. The true scale of the problem and its aetiology must be known in order to develop appropriate services. US studies, which have shown an association between military deployment and increased aggression/criminality, have methodological weaknesses. Recent UK studies of the health and behaviour of military personnel have not examined aggression/criminality. 

Aims: The primary aim of the study is to examine the impact of deployment and deployment-related factors on self-reported aggression and official records of offending in UK military personnel. A range of potential confounders/mediators of any associations will be analysed from data collected both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Changes in levels of antisocial outcomes over time and in relation to military deployment will also be examined. 

Methods and Design: Data will be utilised from a large representative cohort of deployed and non-deployed UK military personnel (10,272), established by King?s Centre for Military Health Research and followed up prospectively since 2003. Data, collected by questionnaire, includes pre-service, deployment and combat experiences, past/current health and behaviour, alcohol use and a range of other factors. The cohort data will also be linked to Police National Conviction Records to obtain an objective outcome measure of offending and also an objective measure of pre-military antisocial behaviour.

Scientific and medical opportunities: Mental health and behavioural problems facing those in the military become the problem of society and the NHS and CJS when they return from deployment or ultimately leave the military. High quality information on health and behaviour outcomes post-deployment is necessary to plan health services for serving/ex-serving UK personnel and toevelop strategies aimed at prevention of adverse outcomes. This is a high profile area in which there is a well acknowledged requirement for better research and to develop the next generation of suitably trained academics.

The KCMHR?s established longitudinal cohort study offers the first opportunity in the UK to describe the prevalence, incidence and aetiology of antisocial behaviour in both deployed and non-deployed troops. Linkage of military personnel data with official criminal records has never been done in the UK and is an important advancement in criminal career research. This proposed study is a great example of translational research which is expected to impact on health policies and decisions with regard to treatment and prevention services for this vulnerable group.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>mTBI and the association with violence in the military</gtr:description><gtr:id>48DD922F-65DA-400D-9DE5-08D8CA3FD538</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Neuropsychology
