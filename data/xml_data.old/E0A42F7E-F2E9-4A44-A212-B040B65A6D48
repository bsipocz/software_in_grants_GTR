It differs from all previous methods by having many characteristics which would prove extremely useful for general applications.

PIA funding specifically facilitated the design of the physical layout of a MEMS microphone device with associated electronics and software programming.

Three projects were funded and their findings have have been used as desccribed below under each project heading:

1). 3D Milling
There is a growing industry for miniaturised devices, many on the micrometre or nanometre scale. The manufacture of such devices presents a challenge to the industry, particularly for devices which can be manufactured with high reliability and precision. The project demonstrated a method of manufacture of an extremely simple system that produces optical lenses operating as diffraction-limit-beating super resolution lenses. Several examples of the film lenses were produced and tested on conventional optical microscopes. the method developed for the simplest version is extremely low cost. They have been primarily designed for use in optical microscopy where there is a huge requirement to image beyond the diffraction limit, to image (for example) cell structure in vivo. 

2). Location Awareness 
The results of this project led to the development of a software product that is currently available and in use by companies today. The project helped to form a company that is now currently incubated by the European Space Agency. The company was the European Satellite Navigation Competitor UK Winner of 2013.

3). Blind Source Separation
10 prototypes were designed, manufactured and tested, leading to a new patent filing in October 2011, and two further patent filings in 2013. A website, with demos, using the prototypes was created. Demo units were shown to potential licensees including a major mobile phone manufacturer in the far east which elucidated clear functional requirements which are being developed and tested.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4CC20A68-8710-4F5C-8E92-B1D5A01BE245</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b5c3cbdb700.57364453</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A three-dimensional milling method and apparatus for milling micrometre and a nanometre scale three-dimensional structures.

Their online system is designed to facilitate the management of a dispersed team, thus releasing management time. By linking activities to actual locations, on a computer, tablet or mobile, ManagePlaces reduces staff costs and saves user time by improving outputs and reporting. ManagePlaces was created initially to streamline the management of conservation projects. Through its effectiveness in this sector, it was decided to offer the product to businesses in other areas who face the same issues. ManagePlaces is incubated with the support of the European Space Agency.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3984E39B-C010-43DF-BDE0-A26488A386B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK ESNC Winner 2013.
