&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? Our target audiences will be front line staff and managers of third sector organisations, volunteers, (and, if appropriate, service users in receipt of support); and policy makers and commissioners of third sector services. 
How will they benefit? The activities outlined in the case for support are designed to produce a suite of outputs and resources tailored for third sector use, developed through a network of projects that bring academic and practice organisations into collaboration. The nature of the outputs will be determined in consultation with NCVO, The Scottish Government, IVAR and selected third sector organisation associated with the projects, but we currently envisage producing the following resources that would be of direct benefit to the sector: 
- a report and briefing paper tailored to policy and practice audiences 
- web resources, to include: 
- training materials on the changing landscapes of the third sector, which we will pilot in the practitioner conference workshops 
- an interactive knowledge bank for practitioner use, where experiences of navigating the changing landscapes of the third sector can be logged and shared. This will be widely disseminated through the TSRC Knowledge Portal and if feasible, linked to the NCVO KnowHowNonprofit website. 
Scope of impact We anticipate that the resources will cover a number of dimensions of third sector work, from organisational structures to volunteering, and address the range of themes outlined in the case for support; the project will produce evidence and insights on changing policy landscapes and transformations within the sector itself that can be documented for sector use. The production of the resources in consultation with the sector will help to ensure utility. 
Assessment of impact. We envisage seeking feedback on the training materials and web resources during the practitioner conference and through survey feedback from web users within a year of the end of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100433</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Developing Initiatives for Supporting Communities (DISC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The development of reflective practice-research dialogue concerning the implementation of a voluntary sector-led partnership programme of work supporting adults with multiple and complex needs</gtr:description><gtr:id>F08A6389-3C05-418B-B65B-7F8B344C87DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes from this collaboration are not expected until 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463324b24bec9.36769699-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This collaboration is advisory, drawing on the practitioner expertise of the Research and Development Co-ordinator in DISC.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration is advisory, drawing on the academic expertise of Rob Macmillan.

Prior to the meetings, the stakeholders were sent two papers representing different types of output from the study Changing Landscapes for the Third Sector: sharing knowledge and informing practice, 'Telling tales of volunteering: organisational insights' (on volunteering in different organisational contexts and 'Unfolding tales of voluntary action #2: The boss' (on organisational health checks).



1. These comments have been incorporated into the outputs from the Changing Landscapes Study, in ways that make them most useable for stakeholder practitioners and organisations in the voluntary sector. This consultation has additionally enhanced the style and structure of the Changing Landscapes website so that it can be a more useable resource for non-academic stakeholders. 

2. The consultation process has worked to form and strengthen relationships between Leeds, Birmingham and senior (e.g., chief executives) of major voluntary sector organisations. These relations are particularly important for Leeds, where there is a range of different yet isolated groups working in similar areas and has helped to identify these groups to each other. In particular, the Leeds Community Foundation, where we have been invited to disseminate our research findings later this year, and also through strengthening the links between the School of Sociology and Social Policy and the Care Hub, UoL. 

3. The meetings with practitioners opened up valuable spaces for discussion over pressing current concerns facing voluntary organisations. Examples include understanding the concept and implementation of 'social value' in commissioning; and understanding the recent past as a platform for current trajectories (at community level, in relation to urban community regeneration; and at a cohort level, in relation to an oral history of a generation of welfare rights and advice workers emerging in the 1980s, and recently consolidated into a single advice organisation for a large city).

4. New research avenues from these meetings include a practitioner-research dialogue about the processes, dilemmas and learning from a new and experimental initiative focusing on vulnerable people. 

5. This process also builds towards two particular funding initiatives, in similar ways. The first is to the ESRC responsive mode programme, on Big Data and the Third Sector (involving both Hughes and Macmillan); the second is the Dynamics of Vulnerability: a longitudinal perspective, to the ESRC large grants scheme (Hughes, Neale and other colleagues). In particular, this HEIF study has paved the way for future consultation in the preparation of these funding applications with key stakeholders, and identified those best placed to contribute to and support research development and progress as members of the advisory groups required for both. It is anticipated both these bids will be submitted during 2015.

6. This consultation process has been a unique opportunity to disseminate findings from the study to key users and to understand how these findings and outputs might be diffused through their organisations. These will be included as findings for the Changing Landscapes study and will appear on the project website. The HEIF funding, therefore, has added value not only to this ESRC study, but also helped to inform all future outputs for practitioners and professionals in similar organisations - an invaluable addition to any research which seeks policy and professional impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462157c49cf24.83486238</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hughes, K., (2015) Changing Landscapes for the Third Sector:  sharing knowledge and enhancing understanding, Civic Engagement, as part of the WISERD network.

Substantive Impacts: The secondary analysis findings on volunteering have been disseminated in a number of contexts. Understanding the longitudinal dynamics of volunteering and how volunteers might comprise the bedrock of services in an austerity-led funding context has been seen as crucial to organisational restructure across the third sector. In particular, these findings have been identified by CEOs and senior staff in key stakeholder organisations as important to understanding how organisation can help to grow or develop individuals in terms of their skills and confidence. These impacts have been mobilised through a major practitioner conference (reported on the project website) attended by a wide range of practitioner groups. Findings from the synthesis and 'unfolding tales' series were discussed with a range of frontline third sector practitioners in workshops and one-to-one meetings in London, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Birmingham in June and July 2014. Practitioners were asked to provide feedback on whether the themes and issues covered in the papers were of interest and use, and whether they resonate with their own experiences. Overall the material resonated strongly, and opened up valuable spaces for reflection on pressing current concerns facing voluntary organisations, as well as new research avenues. One practitioner noted how the material managed to 'get under the skin' of what really happens in organisations, and raised questions, for example, about leadership in the voluntary sector. Another could identify with some of the challenges organisations face and utilised the dimensions of an organisational 'health check' reported in one paper for use in his own organisation. Findings on organisational life cycles, moments of step change and organisational vulnerability, such as when an organisation employs staff or takes on a building for the first time have been identified by third sector organisations as important insights. The importance of 'vision and mission' in organisations have led senior staff to re-visit their own documentation. Additionally, the synthesis work on how organisations evidence social impacts has been welcomed by a number of organisations, where 'social value' in commissioning is a problematic criterion yet is crucial in successful funding applications. The case studies have been described as useful, particularly as they relate to different sized organisations and therefore have a broad application and relevance. Impacts are still emerging, tracked through NCVO, our study partner although, to date, much of these impacts are evidenced through word of mouth, and reported practice.
 
Methodological Impacts: Technological: The Changing Landscapes data has been added to a thematic repository, the Timescapes Archive, hosted by the University of Leeds (UoL) library service. The data are available on request for consultation and reuse from:
http://timescapes.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/view/project/Changing_Landscapes=3A_Pathways_Through_Participation.html. The CL and other Timescapes datasets have provided important pilot data to test out a new data repository platform (EPrints) for UoL and have been an excellent springboard for thinking through how to organise QL data associated with a specific project. CL and Timescapes data has been used in several inward and outward facing presentations to demonstrate the possibilities of a data archive. The Timescapes Archive (TA) was successfully used as a test case for infrastructure and ingest requirements and has been used to develop a new business case for a multimedia repository at the UoL. The new technical solutions developed for TA have been scaled up for the institutional data repository, and the software additions for open source access for e-prints have been adopted across the UK. The successful migration of TA to the new e-prints open source platform has resulted in an increasing number of researchers undertaking more extensive, cross-data, secondary analysis. Beneficiaries of impact include re-users of the TA data, data management teams, organisations considering or developing institutional data repositories for the purposes of re-use; the UoL library service; all stakeholders in the Timescapes Archive.

Ethical Impacts: the stakeholder model of data sharing developed under Timescapes was refined and extended and the concept of data stewards implemented, shaping staff work commitments and a broader institutional understanding of resource implications for data repositories that have a user interface, and a remit to expand. We now distinguish between interpretative consent, how data will be re/interpreted in future, and enduring consent, framed around the infrastructure and arrangement for re-use - by whom, under what conditions, and with what safeguards, to maximise confidentiality and respect for people's accounts where data is required to be readily obtainable, and requires collaboration with the data stewards (data services). These distinctions have been used to support contractual ethical agreements as part of Leeds institutional data repository and the TA. We have developed gold standard guides to anonymising and preparing datasets for re-use which maintain a balance between confidentiality and data integrity/authenticity. These are now being used by new projects coming forward to deposit data in the TA. The contractual agreements for archive access and data re-use have been refined so that they reflect the continued responsibilities of data-re-users in their re-presentation of data post-analysis. A futures-orientated duty of care has been identified as core to Data Management and the curation of data repositories, an innovation in this field. Continued impacts of these developments are reflected in the relationships now identified as crucial in pararchive debates across the UK, to which the Data Management and Research Team have been contributing. Beneficiaries of the impacts include cross-sector researchers using QL methods and re-using QL data; data repositories stewarding data for re-use; data depositors; and data management teams. Overall, the study has pioneered an innovative model for collaboration between data stewards (data managers at institutional level) and data creators, with significant impacts on the development of a major data infrastructure. Moreover, for this study, the data creators, and sharers were not confined to academic researchers but included third sector agencies and umbrella groups (The National Council for Voluntary Organisations, and the Institute for Voluntary Action Research). The study has thereby built capacity in data management, sharing and reuse for academic researchers and for user organisations. While these impacts were mobilised as an integral part of the study they were also consolidated through a symposium at the recent Pararchive conference, (March 2015). This was jointly organised and delivered by the researchers, user organisations and data managers involved in this study and demonstrated the potential for advancing data sharing and reuse through the building of such collaborative ventures. A publication following on from the symposium is currently under development.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DCA75800-13ED-4F1D-8FBB-B4FF6A83E3F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546219dc513e24.40133075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project developed findings across two core activities: 
1. Knowledge Exchange and Synthesis
Across our network of QL projects we explored how UK voluntary organisations have responded to rapid change over the past decade. Six core themes were identified (sustainability, independence, hybridisation, participation, inter-organisational relationships and impact), which informed our synthesis of 29 project reports and papers. Much research has anticipated that economic recession and public sector austerity, coupled with changing political priorities for the relationship between the voluntary sector and the state, will result in higher demand for the sector's services at a time of constrained resources. Although registered charities show a gradual austerity-related downward trend of aggregate income, figures are broadly stable over time and evidence for wholesale closure of voluntary organisations and community groups is thin. The synthesis provides some explanation for this apparent paradox between a challenging environment, yet organisational survival.
Voluntary organisations have been actively pursuing a range of adjustment strategies designed to keep essential services to meet increasing needs on more limited resources, including: restructuring, redundancies (including shorter hours, and transferring some hitherto paid work to a voluntary basis), greater attention to collaboration and partnership working (albeit with mixed interest in mergers), and intensified efforts to reposition and rebrand organisations over time. Competing conceptions of forward strategies are being formulated and promoted. One strong vision is of the necessity of 'transition', where voluntary organisations adapt their focus and strategies to become more enterprising and business-like. The study has also shed light on the concept and implementation of 'social value' in commissioning; and the value of understanding the recent past as a platform for current trajectories (e.g. at community level, in relation to community regeneration). 
 2. Secondary Analysis
Secondary analysis of 78 QL interviews, drawn from two data sets - Real Times (Third Sector Research Centre), and Pathways through Participation (National Council for Voluntary Organisations/IVR/Involve) - explored the dynamics of volunteering. Volunteering research is often de-contextualised and a-historical, focusing on aggregate trends or engagement in one particular voluntary activity or at one point in time. Yet volunteering is dynamic and situated within multi-layered contexts. Our dynamic analyses revealed that: 
? Volunteering can only be understood in the context of other aspects of individual's lives - e.g., work, family, leisure,- and how these varied trajectories intersect and change over time. 
? Volunteering processes are embedded within family relationships and can be passed on, negotiated, shared and fought over on a collective basis.
? Volunteering is also affected by organisational contexts: as organisations evolve over time, the spaces for and experiences of volunteering change. This can affect recruitment, retention and outcomes.
? Community contexts are vital sources of identity and meaning that shape and are shaped by volunteering processes. Community boundaries indicate the existence of insiders and outsiders, affecting people's participatory possibilities.

The synthesis and secondary analysis work demonstrated the value of scaling up QL research to broaden geographical and historical reach and enhance the evidence base. Bringing the projects together enabled us to create 'big' rich data that, crucially, retains its depth and explanatory power. We intend to respond to the recent ESRC Civil Society Data Partnerships call with research building on our methodological developments in this study.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Conceptual and instrumental impact is being created for:
