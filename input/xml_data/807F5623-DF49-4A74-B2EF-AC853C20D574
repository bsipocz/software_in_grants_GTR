The IP protocol, which has become the thin-waist of the protocol stack, on the one hand guarantees a common language for communication between any network and any device, but on the other, restricts both communication and computation at the end-points of any connection. This further limits the Internet architecture from integrating new functionalities at the core of the network, unavoidably pushing innovation at the application layer.

We argue that network functionality (in terms of content and service management) does not necessarily need to be pushed at the application-layer of the connection's end-points, but can instead be managed at the network-layer of mid-path network entities.

To achieve our goals we will make use of the basic principles of two new networking paradigms, namely Information-Centric Networks (ICNs) and Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). ICNs introduce the notion of named-content objects and enable management of named-content at the network-layer (or data-plane) of any network device. SDNs on the other hand, focus on network management operations and push functionality at the control plane. Although both paradigms hold huge potential to change internetworking as we know it today, they both face implementation challenges.

In this project, we will combine the functionality of ICNs and SDNs and take advantage of their novel concepts to design a new common Internet playground, where innovation will not be forcefully pushed at the application layer. We will follow pragmatic implementation routes to guarantee that the challenges faced in the areas of ICN and SDN are smoothly overcome.

The high-level objectives of the project are the following:

1. implement and integrate the required technology to allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) implement their own protocols of choice within their administrative domains, allowing for de-ossification of the Internet architecture.
2. allow in-network entities to execute logic and run instances of applications mid-path from source to destination, which are otherwise run within data-centres, more often than not, far away from the end-users.

The above targets will be achieved by introducing a new Internet market player, which we call In-Network Service Provider (or INSP) and who will take on the task (and cost) of implementing the proposed functionality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a high-risk/high-impact project. The timescale of the projected impact is targeting the period of the next 10-30 years. In case of successful adoption of the project results, which we are confident will be significant, network operation and application execution will be revolutionised.

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will have the chance to administer their domains according to demand-supply ratios, rather than being passive &amp;quot;bit pushers&amp;quot;, struggling to keep their networks running, as is the case today. ISPs operating in rural areas will have the chance to operate under simpler intra-domain routing protocols for instance, or applying different traffic engineering techniques. In contrast, a mobile operator in a very densely populated area, will need more scalable mobile communication protocols. For example, TCP has been repeatedly shown to perform poorly under mobility conditions and although dozens of alternatives exist, they cannot inter-operate with conventional TCP, due to the highly rigid Internet core functionality.

Application logic will not need to take place in massive-scale data-centres only. Instead, instances or fractions of applications for peer-assisted services will also execute mid-path from source to destination. This alters application development to run in a distributed manner and opens radical new avenues for unforeseen applications.

Our handheld devices (smartphones) today are more powerful than the first computers were 40 years ago (which occupied whole buildings, similarly to today's data-centres). The Internet architecture has to be ready to integrate the data-centres of the future and exploit resources in the best possible manner. This project sets out to be a stepping stone towards this direction. The project anticipates to open a new research area, in which the academic community will have to engage and take further.

Given the forward-looking and ambitious vision of this project, whose result is expected to show within the 10 to 30 year timeframe, we split the expected impact in short-, medium- and long-term.

Short-term Impact (0-5 years):

This time period is covering the lifetime of the project and we expect the main benefit here to come in terms of research outcome. That said, the academic community will benefit from the new research area we are seeking to establish.

Medium-term Impact (5-10 years):

This time period will follow the completion of the project and is the period during which research results will be adjusted to the needs of real implementations. Although during the project the design will be based on realistic settings, hardware and software technology evolution will influence implementation settings. We expect that both the academic community and the R&amp;amp;D industry will work on adapting the solutions of the project to real-world environments and guarantee full backwards compatibility.

Furthermore, new research areas will be formed pushing innovation inside the networking core, rather than at the application layer.

Long-term Impact (10-30 years):

We expect the following entities to benefit from the successful adoption of the results of this project in the long term:

- ISPs: will have the opportunity to actively manage traffic in their networks according to supply and demand and will be able to operate according to their own protocols and traffic engineering rules.
- Application developers: will have the opportunity to run instances of their applications in a distributed manner, closer to the audience they are targeting and not in a centralised fashion within data-centres. This will also reduce their costs, as they won't need to pay big cloud providers with global footprint, but rather local INSPs, where their audience is based. It will also help smaller companies and individuals to get into the Internet market area.
- Users: will see improved performance in terms of content delivery and application or service response times.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>972416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EC H2020 - ICN2020</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Grant Agreement No. 723014</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E5DDF8F4-6AA3-4321-88B3-0DDBFA967B8D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6dfd39c5e92.35615824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A part of our work in the INSP project has been promoted and is currently being supported by initiatives in the area of ICT for development. In particular, the ISOC-supported (Internet Society) workshop on &amp;quot;Future Internet for Development&amp;quot; (FI4D - https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~al773/fi4d/2017/, co-located with IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)) produced a report on how our findings on &amp;quot;Keyword-Based Mobile Application Sharing&amp;quot; (reported in more detail in the &amp;quot;Key Findings&amp;quot; section) can be of use in developing regions. Our contribution (the software tools developed), which can be part of a cheap hardware infrastructure (such as a Raspberry Pi) can provide edge-cloud services to the general public in developing countries. Although there is no tangible outcome or deployment yet, the fact that our work is supported by ISOC (apart from the research/academic community) is a positive sign for future societal impact.

We have introduced DRENCH [1] as a low complexity NFV and flow steering management framework. Our initial investigation shows that it is indeed possible to design a technically sound architecture to realise distributed content management [2], [3] and service placement [1]. Our algorithmic framework (DRENCH - Distributed Load Balancing for NFV-based Service Function Chaining) [1] provides an elegant and scalable approach to manage the available resources in the network.

2) An Edge-Computing Framework for Smartphone Application Sharing: We have designed the &amp;quot;Keyword-Based Mobile Application Sharing&amp;quot; (KEBAPP) framework [4], according to which smartphone mobile apps are considered as a pooled resource. That is, a mobile user can make use of applications not directly installed on his own mobile device, but can also take advantage of applications installed in nearby devices. The proposed framework has the potential to revolutionalise the way smartphone applications are built and used today, providing a cheap way to realise an edge-cloud infrastructure beyond the boundaries of the fixed Internet.

3) Redefining Mobile Connectivity: We have proposed, designed and built the concept of &amp;quot;Information-Centric Connectivity&amp;quot; (ICCON), a novel concept, which associates connectivity of mobile devices to the content or service they are looking to retrieve [5]. We have argued that link-layer connectivity can be associated with information-availability and in this respect connectivity decisions should be information-aware. Our proposals have the potential to revolutionalise the way mobile applications are resolved, instantiated, and executed.

4) Video Streaming in Mobile Environments: Extending our vision further to the mobile part of the network, we have proposed a model to assess the perceptive Quality of Experience (QoE) of commuters in the London underground network when streaming media [6]. In particular, we have assumed that both WiFi and cellular connectivity exists when trains are within stations and (poor) cellular connectivity exists (i.e., no WiFi) when trains are moving in-between stations. We have found that when users download media individually the perceived QoE is poor. Instead, when users download collaboratively, they achieve significant QoE. Designing smartphone applications taking this concept into account has the potential to enable new services in the mobile part of the network.

5) Towards a Native Content Distribution Network: All current architectural proposals, including the most prevalent one (i.e., NDN) focus on the optimisation of &amp;quot;how to route requests towards the core of the network&amp;quot;. We argue that this goes against the original vision of a &amp;quot;native content distribution network&amp;quot; and prevents requests from discovering nearby content, unless the content is on the shortest path to the core of the network.

With a view to improving the content discovery capabilities of the NDN architecture, we have proposed an enhancement to the routing fabric, which keeps track of successful (i.e., served) content requests in a separate routing table, called &amp;quot;Downstream FIB&amp;quot; (D-FIB) [7], [8]. The same concept was applied to the case of network fragmentation, where the idea is that once the network gets fragmented and the origin server cannot be reached, the network should intelligently look for copies of the content downwards, towards the users [9].

6) Cache clusters for improved cache performance: The placement of content in in-network content caches has a direct impact on the performance of the cache system. Carefully placed content can significantly increase cache hit performance, but at the same time might increase signalling and communication overhead, in order to make informed decisions on both content placement but also content retrieval. We have proposed novel domain clustering techniques in order to limit management overhead but at the same time provide the same level of quality of service (in terms of content delivery time) [3]. Our results demonstrate that indeed, by splitting domains in smaller clusters we manage to limit the overhead required to manage such a cache system without a decrease in cache hits (subject to content popularity).

7) Energy Efficiency of ICN Routers: Given the sophistication of network routers under an ICN forwarding and caching paradigm, researchers have investigated the energy efficiency of such a network. There is a tradeoff between caching and therefore, reducing the amount of traffic travelling upwards in the network and the energy needed to perform caching operations. We have implemented a software router and have measured the energy consumption under realistic workloads. We have built a model for the energy consumption of an ICN router, which we hope will be useful for the community and will be used in similar studies [10].

Our model in [6] above has already attracted attention (through talks where we have already disseminated our work) by the community and we expect that after publication it will be established as one of the main models to assess the QoE perceived by mobile users in transport networks.

Our work on dynamic service placement [1] is one of the very few of its kind in the area and as such, we expect that it will be widely adopted and used in the areas of SDN and NFV.

Finally, we expect that our work on &amp;quot;Keyword-Based Mobile Application Sharing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Information-Centric Connectivity&amp;quot; will spark a new research direction and will trigger further research, which will build on the concepts proposed in this project. In fact, KEBAPP has already attracted attention by the research community working on ICT for Development, as it provides a very cheap way to provide cloud-like services at the edge of the network. Indeed, community networks in developing countries can greatly benefit by such a framework. We have established channels with the ICT for Development community and we plan to disseminate our findings further.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>98FD7F4E-659C-4D54-AEA4-4164BD8134E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e071b0a9c852.94335122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>In the context of our work on Keyword-Based Mobile Application Sharing (KEBAPP - see Key findings for further details), we have developed a software platform based on innovative Information-Centric Networking technology. Our platform enables mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) to share applications with nearby devices/users. As a representative example, we have developed the &amp;quot;routeFinder&amp;quot; application. Picture the following: you have just arrived at a busy train station or airport in a foreign country where you have to pay roaming charges to access the Internet. You need to find the route to your hotel/meeting through public transport, but don't have the local transport-authority application (e.g., similar to TfL). Chances are that the majority of people around you have the application you need. Using our novel platform, you can make a request giving free text keywords (e.g., your journey details) and devices around will calculate the route (e.g., which buses, tube lines you need to use) and return back the result. This is of great use not only to avoid roaming charges, but also avoid slow Internet connections when in very crowded places, or places where Internet is not available (e.g., while inside the tube, airplane etc.).</gtr:description><gtr:id>5257E067-D981-4163-9AEF-B3EEF03E9296</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The KEBAPP software has the potential to revolutionise the way smartphone applications are built.
