The idea of the 'mamma italiana' is one of the most widespread and recognisable stereotypes in perceptions of Italian national character both within and beyond Italy. This stereotype can be summarised as of a strong woman who dotes on her son and spoils him, gaining, in return, great influence over his choices, with, between the two of them, a great emotional and symbolic dependency. This figure, and the effects of 'mammismo', which make frequent appearances in jokes and other forms of popular culture, are often seen by politicians and social commentators as profoundly influential in Italian society. 'Mammismo' has been considered a contributing factor to many of what are perceived as current 'problems' with the Italian family including the advanced age at which many Italian 'children', (particularly, but not only, sons) leave home, the extremely unequal gender division of labour within Italian households and even Italy's dramatically low birth rate. 
Despite much media and political attention, however, as yet there has been very little academic analysis of this stereotype, its empirical foundations and its social effects and this is the primary aim of these workshops. They will explore the origins, meaning and influence of the stereotype and also contextualise it by examining other, contrasting, ways in which maternity, and the mother-son relationship, has been understood and represented in culture and society over the last century and a half in Italy and its diaspora. The stereotype will also be contextualised through the contributions of scholars who have studied the history and sociology of the family itself, and the role of mothers and sons within it. The impact on the role of daughters and husbands will also be explored and due attention will be paid to the effects on masculine identities. 
Since an interdisciplinary approach is absolutely essential to grappling with an embedded notion like this, our workshops will involve a range of disciplines including history, gender studies, Italian studies, sociology, literary studies and film studies. In order to ensure that debate reaches beyond the walls of academia, it will also include a number of other relevant 'stakeholders' with an interest in this issue. 
Further debate on this important but neglected question will be encouraged through a project website and on-line discussion forum as well as an edited book of some of the papers presented. 

Aims and Objectives
- to be the first study to bring together experts from across a range of disciplines to analyse the stereotype of 'la mamma' and 'mammismo' and its effects on Italian society and the Italian diaspora 
- to assess the importance of the stereotype in Italian society, both historically and in present-day Italy, with special regard to the construction of gender and national identities and in the context of other competing understandings and representations of the maternal role
- to encourage debate across the disciplines, but also in the media, amongst social policy makers and the general public
- to increase knowledge and understanding of an important aspect of Italian culture, in Italy, the UK and beyond
- to contribute to the understanding of the functioning and effects of stereotypes in society

Potential Applications and Benefits
These workshops will be of benefit to academics interested in the society, history, culture and politics of Italy and its diaspora, and to those whose research focuses on motherhood and/or the family, or on the formation and performance of gender or national identities. 
They will also help inform policy-makers interested in interventions in the Italian family and inform public debate in Italy and in the Italian diaspora.
They will also both analyse processes of 'cultural translation' and make their own contribution to such processes by enabling greater understanding of the society and culture of an important European nation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential primary users and beneficiaries of this project outside the academic community are those engaged in formulating and shaping social policy as well as the media and the general public (particularly, but not only, in Italy). We also envisage that this project will be of interest to members of the Italian diaspora community dispersed over various continents, including in Scotland and Britain.

It is planned that the first two workshops (on the historical roots and emergence of the stereotype) will be primarily academic events, whereas the second two (focusing on its impact on Italian society and policy today and in the diaspora) will have a more public face, and it will be particularly in these two workshops that dialogue is opened up between academics and non-academics, including a parliamentarian, a trade unionist representing migrant domestic servants and a representative of a mothers' organisations (such as Radiomamma.it, an online forum for Italian mothers). These workshops will endeavour to make an impact on debate which will feed into policy making in Italy on matters related to the family. Given that we are tackling an important and well-known stereotype, with a hold in the popular imagination, we believe that our debates will be of widespread interest to the general public and the media in Italy.

By exposing, challenging and exploring the ideas, values and preconceptions that underpin debates about maternity and social policy in Italy, this project will also enable greater understanding of Italy by outsiders and further the project of 'cultural translation' between European nations, essential for a number of reasons including the fact that so much of the legislation that affects British people is formulated in Brussels. We envisage that our edited book will be of interest to social policymakers in the European union (including British policy-makers working within a European context).

We will also engage with the public through the organisation of a special screening of an Italian film with a theme relevant to the workshops, preceded by an introductory public lecture by one of the workshop participants. This screening will be held in conjunction with the fourth workshop, at a cinema in Scotland. The inclusion in the final workshop of a Scottish playwright of Italian descent will also open up potential impact on the world of diaspora cultural production.
We will endeavour to present the outputs in a form that will make them accessible (through clarity of language) to a non-academic audience, whilst at the same time, ensuring that we maintain a high level of academic rigour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33435</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scottish Italian Motherhood Public Event (Edinburgh May 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2DA55C5A-C6B3-4338-B5CE-4776C80506EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The afternoon of the fourth AHRC network workshop on 'The Stereotype Abroad: Mammismo in the Italian Diaspora' was dedicated to a public event exploring the identity of Scottish Italian mothers: 'Maw or Mamma? Mothers and Motherhood in the Italian-Scottish community', through personal testimonies, a keynote address by Mary Contini (cookery writer and prominent Italian Scottish businesswoman), a theatrical performance by Laura Pasetti (Piccolo Teatro, Milan), followed by a debate with the audience. The event was extremely successful in exploring a range of ideas and provoking a very lively debate amongst an audience that was drawn largely from the Italian-Scottish Community.

In feedback questionnaires, members of the audience all expressed their appreciation of the event with most saying that it had either changed the way that they thought about Italian motherhood and its stereotypes or given them a deeper understanding of the subject. Nearly all said they would like to be involved further in exploring this topic as part of the research project and to attend future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546282cb35b791.14285396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lamammaitaliana.wordpress.com/edinburgh-spring-2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture/Debate with Marina d'Amelia and Chiara Saraceno (Dundee, May 2012)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7FC9391-8536-467D-8262-5BFCE98470D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The discussion between two experts on Italian motherhood, 'La Mamma.

Marina D'Amelia, author of La Mamma (Il Mulino, 2005) in conversation with Chiara Saraceno' informed a diverse public - including members of the Italian Scottish community from the region around Dundee - about the latest thinking on the study of motherhood in Italy and it was followed by a lively debate on the role of stereotypes more generally and the relationship between the Italian and other stereotypes of motherhood.

Initial event for AHRC network which raised awareness of the project beyond members of the team and planned academic workshops.

This allowed me to raise awareness of the project internationally, speaking to an audience that included academics, but also artists, poets, website managers, novelists, therapists etc from across the world.

The paper was well received by a varied audience. The main quantifiable impact however was academic, with an invitation to join MIRCI (Motherhood Initiative in Research and Community Involvement, based in Toronto but international in reach) and discussions of possible future research collaborations in motherhood studies with colleagues from Canada and Sweden.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54628c945a7df6.71864815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://mommuseum.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rome workshop (Jan 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61C972E4-67DF-4A08-8CE8-B719DBD19275</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The third AHRC network workshop, 'La maternita' in Italia', held in the Library of the Parliament Building in Rome, aimed to examine social images of motherhood in modern Italian society, public discourse and policy making and the constraints experienced by Italian women in becoming mothers and by Italian children in leaving the parental home. It brought together practitioners from a range of sectors - Senator Livia Turco, journalist Alessandra di Pietro, care worker trades unionist Lidia Obando, government adviser and university professor Chiara Saraceno - and academics Marina d'Amelia, Sandro Bellassai and the core group of the AHRC network on La mamma to debate with a general public audience. The debate was very lively and covered a wide range of topics including women and work, the stereotype of Italian motherhood, childcare, migrant careworkers' 'mothering', and the audience was very involved with many taking the floor to participate in the debate. The event was announced in the national magazine 'Noi donne' and the online magazine InGenere and Radio RAI (the national broadcaster) interviewed Chiara Saraceno about the event and the theme of precarious motherhood in present-day Italy (10 Jan 2013).

Marina d'Amelia was contacted directly by a number of the audience expressing their approval that these issues were being raised and their desire that there should be further events to try to influence public opinion. Lidia Obando contacted the PI to say that she felt the event had been very useful, particularly in exploring the question of women and work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54627c1a7c7022.96718173</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lamammaitaliana.wordpress.com/rome-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Maternal mental health event (Glasgow May 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D419A958-5845-4BF5-9745-BE687CFB4080</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'The ambiguity of motherly love' was a public event organised by Andrea Hajek to link her British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship on 'Exploring the legacy of feminism in Northern Italy: motherhood, family life, sexuality and employment (1967-2012)' with the AHRC network La mamma. It was designed to explore ideas about the challenges and silences motherhood today in Italy and the UK, through the screening of the Italian film 'Tutto parla di te' and a roundtable discussion between practitioners - including therapists, a psychiatrist, antenatal teachers, a local government parents' officer, staff of the Glasgow Women's Library - and Penelope Morris, the PI of the AHRC network, Andrea Hajek and members of the public. The film provoked a great deal of debate and there was a good discussion between panel members and the audience.

In the questionnaire completed by those who attended the event, two thirds of the respondents indicated that they found the event extremely useful; over half of the respondents agreed very strongly that they had gained a greater awareness of the problems discussed; around 25% responded positively to the question which asked if they had changed their perspective on the issues discussed as a result of the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462892c9d8472.13945289</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mlc/staff/andreahajek/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I027517/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
