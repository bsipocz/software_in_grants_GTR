&lt;p>The Development Hub will have 9 core aims and objectives, namely to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>actively take steps to drive forward the ambition of a UK Longitudinal Study&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>promote the impact of the Census Longitudinal Studies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver a single portal function to the Census Longitudinal Studies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>harmonise online tools, documentation and guidance, where possible&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver a single helpdesk for responding to generic queries&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>plan and co-ordinate training and outreach activities&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>engage with other related organisations in the UK and overseas to stimulate the most efficient delivery of the service&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>develop and maintain a distinctive identity of the service, in collaboration with the UK Data Service&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>establish and manage a Scientific Advisory Network.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Because of its nature, the Hub is not involved in producing research output itself. However, it will play an important role in maximising the impact of outputs of projects by researchers using the three LS. Each RSU already strives to maximise the impact of its output through, for example, conferences, encouraging and enabling journal publications, website promotion and networking events. In addition, the LS are often used directly by policy-makers either as a source of data for their own research, or through requests for policy briefings and reports to be carried out on their behalf. The impressive lists of peer-reviewed publications already resulting from each LS testify to the impact that the resources have in an extremely diverse range of academic and professional disciplines. (see Academic Beneficiaries section above)

The Hub will further assist in maximising the impact of these outputs, primarily by providing a central focus point for work produced via the RSUs. A streamlined overview website, with links to complimentary pages in each RSU, is one obvious way in which it will be easier to showcase outputs and findings from LS projects. The Hub website will also actively promote the LS and their potential as research resources, either singly or in combination with each other. Joint networking and outreach events by the RSUs will be encouraged and facilitated by the Hub to expand the potential audiences they can reach. In addition, information on the Hub itself will be promoted through posters and flyers at key networking events. 

The Scientific Advisory Network to be set up and maintained by the Hub will also be a useful and direct vehicle for increasing impact, since this will allow promotion of LS research outputs as well as allowing academics, policy-makers and professional bodies to give feedback and guide research in such a way that it is even more useful for their needs and interests.

In these ways, the Hub will have impacts for:

- academics from a diverse range of disciplines, by providing an easier way to access the LS, as well as by providing additional promotion for the output produced from their research;
- professional bodies, who - via the Scientific Advisory Network - can guide research which meets their own evidence needs;
- policy-makers and think-tanks, at international, national and local levels, who can find rich and unparalleled resources in the LS providing a strong evidence-base for their policies and recommendations, and who can also guide further relevant research via the Scientific Advisory Network;
- and ultimately the general public, who in the longer term will benefit from the results of research and policy derived from LS projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>467538</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Office for National Statistics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK Statistical Agencies</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5CAE4BC-1C7B-41D7-92B7-F87362777CD7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The group have co-ordinated panels and sessions at several conferences, including BSPS 2012-2015, Understanding Society and SLLS.

The day included an introduction by Prof Paul Boyle, an official announcement of the data by Sir Andrew Dilnot, and examples of beta-testing research which had been carried out using the new data. 

The morning session was for an audience of invited VIP guests, from the worlds of policy and academia. The afternoon session was much larger and with a more technical focus, and was open to anyone, though aimed primarily at academics and potential users of the datasets.



This was organised by CALLS on behalf of ONS, NISRA, NRS and the LS Research Support Units

The event greatly increased awareness of the new data being added to the ONS LS, as well as introducing the audiences to the SLS, NILS and CALLS Hub. ONS LS saw increased applications for the new data, and CALLS Hub saw a rise in interest both in ourselves and in the possibility of using eDatashield to combine LSs in their analyses.

Members of the CALLS team, the directors of the LS RSUs and a guest (Prof Emily Grundy), introduced the UK Longitudinal Studies and their potential in the morning session. After lunch the Network members took part in sandbox sessions to discuss and propose a list of research topics they felt the data might be able to contribute to.

Information about the LSs was disseminated at a high level within the organisations represented on the SPiNe - including senior figures from the NI Assembly, Welsh Assembly, Govt Depts such as DWP and various Think Tanks. There was enthusiasm for the potential of the datasets, and members are keen to use our data in their work (directly helping to shape and influence policy and practice recommendations).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1335258568.94930672b421128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://calls.ac.uk/about/spine/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CALLS Hub UK Longitudinal Studies Roadshow, Glasgow</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E83E1C2-1DC0-450A-95C6-0F8755AEB1BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25 Postgrads, Academics and Local Govt researchers attended the second Roadshow event.

These provide a unique and powerful research resource for a diverse range of academic disciplines as can be seen from our list of outputs. They also form a powerful source of research evidence for policy-makers, practitioners and third sector bodies.

CALLS Hub exists to help users and potential users find the information and resources they need in a straightforward way, and promote the work and impact of the RSU's to a wider audience.

Our website and helpdesk form a one-stop portal for researchers interested in using the Longitudinal Studies for their analyses. By bringing together the three studies, we can also highlight the potential benefits and opportunities of using more than one LS for research, either to provide a comparison of regional differences, or to expand the study population to ensure that results can be generalised to the whole country.

During 2015 we are pleased to have enhanced the data dictionary facility, valuable to all users of the ESRC's census-linked longitudinal studies. In particular we have now made available the possibility of evaluating which variables can be accessed for comparative studies across all three datasets and which require manipulation prior to analysis. This we believe adds value to the users of the statistical infrastructure funded by ESRC.

A second significant avenue that has been advanced during 2015 has been the organisation of Longitudinal Roadshows around the UK. These have sought not only to widen the usage of ESRC's datasets but to encouraged longitudinal thinking amongst policy makers. Our roadshows have varied in focus from promoting longitudinal methods in health studies (Aberdeen roadshow) through use of synthetic data (London roadshow) to consideration of the value for policy makers of thinking longitudinally in relation to housing and ethnicity (Bristol and Glasgow roadshows). In 2016/7, we have embarked on a programme of work to produce resources for researchers using the Longitudinal Studies to investigate particular research themes. For example, we ran a webinar on the use of the longitudinal studies for research on health inequalities that was attended by researchers both within and beyond academia. Related to the above activity, we have conducted a citation analysis to refine the way in which we target our promotion activities towards neglected research areas and groups that make less frequent use of the Longitudinal Studies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E06733B-E069-4E21-9981-7C150A5DD280</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546381ed6c09b6.57012166</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The nature of the investment is to support research infrastructure and in particular to support access to census-linked data sets such as through the development of an online dictionary allowing users to check the comparability of data across the three census-based longitudinal studies</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Over the past year the CALLS-Hub team have continued to encourage and support use of the longitudinal studies across the UK. For example, we have worked with each of the National Statistical agencies to work towards a standard application form for each of the Longitudinal Studies (LS). And we have promoted the valuable innovations around synthetic LS data and e-Datashield that make LS data more accessible to researchers. We have evolved our approach to promotion of LS data by conducting a citation analysis to identify and target disciplinary and thematic gaps in the use of this data. And we have developed new thematic resources, such as the recent webinar on the use of LS data for research on health inequalities, to support the use of Census Longitudinal Studies in particular research fields again informed by our citation analysis. We continue to work with other Data custodians, for example, we actively participate in the Data Resource Training Network and are involved in joint events with the UK Data Archive.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3A82907F-70B3-4FEE-A812-D6BB9E257462</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546386123f9735.36083902</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://calls.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Royal Society of Edinburgh evidence to the Scottish Affairs Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C4A7B43-02D1-438B-A573-FC8DF9955011</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is impossible to know. The RSE report to the committee recommended that changes to the funding regime for Scotland should not be modified until after the next census in 2021, in view of the uncertainty of adjusting payments in relation to demographic changes (especially migration statistics). It appears that the recommendation to government has postponed any change to the funding settlement between the UK and Scottih governments until after 2021, but whether this is because of the evidence given or because of political factors (after the next Holyrood elections in 2021) is hard to determine.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd943c4f52b4.89264695</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF2EBFC5-BE54-4CC4-A564-05B6778A7952</gtr:id><gtr:title>Back To The Future: Does your past predict your future?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e235614abd7d881bbe3b8740c66d9395"><gtr:id>e235614abd7d881bbe3b8740c66d9395</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Duke-Williams O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a325742da994.15675110</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E991534F-B99D-4185-A710-67C6FE01AB42</gtr:id><gtr:title>CALLS Hub - poster presentation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2daa79c5e9c4335427f13e710303f1b3"><gtr:id>2daa79c5e9c4335427f13e710303f1b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Findlay A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a31e47755eb1.36122638</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A18D6A8E-9B1C-44A0-AB5C-B757D53A6F15</gtr:id><gtr:title>An introduction to the Longitudinal Studies for health researchers</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8082ef5a08decc6a91548b81bb18a17"><gtr:id>b8082ef5a08decc6a91548b81bb18a17</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marshall A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a330c6124475.28499926</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57693C9C-6335-4A12-859F-160E84106538</gtr:id><gtr:title>Census &amp;amp;
