These 'health inequalities' (which can be seen in the UK and many other countries in the western world regardless of national wealth) are unjust and costly to the economy. Despite this, little is known about why these health differences emerge and even less is known about how to prevent them. For example, do less advantaged children experience poorer health because their parents are less able to afford the things they need to help their children stay healthy (such as nutritious foods), because they live in poorer quality housing, or because their parents experience barriers to health information or services? My programme of research seeks to address these questions by analysing information from two large studies of children, born at the turn of the 21st century, in the UK (the Millennium Cohort Study) and in Australia (the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children). The majority of evidence refers to the association between social background and health at one point in time; however, social background and health vary over time and so might the relationship between them. Social, economic, and health information has been collected on the MCS and LSAC children and their families, at several time points throughout their childhood. I will exploit this longitudinal information to describe how the health of children from different social backgrounds in these two countries varies, exploring factors which might influence these differences, such as poverty, the home environment, and parental health; and important events or transitions, such as starting primary school. I will look at a number of measures of social background, such as mother's education, occupation and family structure, because the pathways through which these characteristics influence health are likely to vary. I will also examine several aspects of physical and mental health; for example, childhood overweight, emotional and behavioural development, and unintentional injuries. The areas of health I focus on most will be based on how common they are, their social distribution, and whether they can be changed through policy. 

Health inequalities can also be seen in very young children; for example, infants from poorer backgrounds are more likely to be born with low birthweight or experience infections in early infancy, and these conditions are likely to lead to other poor health outcomes later on in childhood. Mothers from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to engage in risky health behaviours which could influence the health of their child, for example they are more likely to smoke in pregnancy and less likely to breastfeed or have their child immunised. Following the mother back in time, before the child was born or even conceived, will help to understand how inequalities in child health emerge. To give an example, are women from less advantaged backgrounds more likely to experience depression before pregnancy? And if so does this make it harder for them to give up smoking during pregnancy or to persevere with breastfeeding when their child is born? I will investigate these types of questions using information from the Southampton Women's Survey, which was established at a similar time to the MCS and LSAC. The study follows approximately 12000 women who were childbearing age in 1998-2000, and of whom approximately 3000 went on to have children in the period '99-'07. 

Finally, I will compare and contrast inequalities in child health (and factors explaining them) in the UK and Australia. Focussing on an area of health where there are large differences found between the two countries, I will examine the role that the UK and Australian governments might play in reducing or exacerbating child health inequalities. I will make recommendations to inform policy development, and produce analytical plan to carry out a future policy evaluation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cross-sectional associations between socio-economic circumstances (SECs) and child health have been widely documented; however, there is a paucity of research exploiting the longitudinal data of contemporary cohort studies to explore how SECs and health relate over time, and the pathways through which SECs influence child health. Cross-cohort and cross-country comparisons also offer potential for understanding when and why inequalities in health emerge. Furthermore, little is known about the role of policy in reducing or exacerbating health inequalities, due in part to the general unsuitability of experimental research designs for evaluating policy effects. 
This study seeks to address these gaps. Data from two large and contemporary cohorts will be used to explore and contrast the social patterning of child health from birth to age 11 in the UK and Australia, using longitudinal methods. Absolute and relative inequalities will be estimated across the social gradient, for a number of SECs measures and several aspects of health (allowing for the interplay between physical and mental health). Then, focusing on a reduced number of health measures which are highly prevalent or socially distributed, I will examine and compare pathways through which SECs influence children's health in the two countries. Data from a contemporary women's cohort in the UK, which has collected data prior to and during pregnancy and information on outcomes in infancy, will be used to investigate why health inequalities emerge early on. Finally, the differences observed between the UK and Australia in the social distribution of health throughout childhood, and the mediators explaining them, will be used to consider the potential role of policy in shaping child health inequalities and to develop an analytical plan to test this. Findings will be used to inform UK and international policy development, including the timing and nature of interventions, for the reduction of child health inequalities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The findings from this fellowship will benefit a wide range of UK, Australian and international stakeholders including policy makers, health professionals, charities and think tanks, and the general public. It will do this through increasing our understanding of inequalities in child health and why they emerge, equipping charities and think tanks with evidence to press for policy change and providing evidence to policy makers to inform policy development. Findings will be disseminated in a way that ensures they will reach all interested parties (see Communications Plan).

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds suffer worse health than those from richer backgrounds. These differences are unjust and, in theory, preventable. Poor health in childhood increases the risk of lower educational achievement and poorer outcomes in adulthood, in terms of health and also socio-economic status, thus perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage. A recent study estimated that in the European Union more than 700000 deaths and 33 million cases of ill health could be avoided each year if people with lower secondary education or below experienced the same health as those with higher secondary education. These unnecessary cases of ill health and mortality made up 20% of total healthcare costs, 15% of social security costs, and lead to a 1.4% fall in GDP through reduced labour productivity. In the long term findings from the research will lead to an improvement in the wellbeing of children and the adults that they will become, in turn helping to break the cycle of disadvantage. An equalisation of health across social groups will also benefit the economy through a reduction in mortality and morbidity and the associated costs of healthcare, welfare and loss of productivity. 

The coalition government recognise the importance of the early years and the need to tackle inequalities in child health in the English Public Health White Paper &amp;quot;Healthy lives, healthy people&amp;quot;, Social Mobility Strategy &amp;quot;Opening doors, breaking down barriers&amp;quot; and several independent reviews. The need for further research in these areas was a central focus in many of these documents. I will identify risk factors for poor child health that present themselves either before or during pregnancy and this information could be used by health professionals to target at risk groups, through the development of new interventions or by informing existing schemes such as the Healthy Start scheme and Health Visitors. It will also contribute to a better understanding of how physical and mental health interact, helping to shape future policies and especially multi-faceted interventions designed to improve wellbeing, such as the Family Nurse Partnership programme. 

Concerted efforts have been made by the government in recent years to reduce inequalities in health; however, these actions have not had the desired effect. Recent critiques claim that the English strategy to reduce inequalities did not address the root causes of inequality, and did not implement effective policies. However, the research base on which to build these policies was, and still is, lacking. By gaining a better understanding of how social background influences health over time it will be possible to determine at what points in childhood intervention might be useful and what types of interventions might be most effective. This could help policy makers to modify existing interventions such as Sure Start Children's Centres, design new strategies, and target resources more effectively. Findings will also help to shape clinical practice, via bodies such as NICE. Through carrying out a cross-country comparison we can also learn from the comparative experience of the Australian government.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279542</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>Socio-economic inequalities in wheeze in the Southampton Women Survey</gtr:description><gtr:id>EEAA247C-B738-4CA7-875D-5951BA7DAAA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All in draft</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dfe384035187.80302747-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In a one week visit at the unit I was given access all general facilities and also the Southampton Women Survey.
