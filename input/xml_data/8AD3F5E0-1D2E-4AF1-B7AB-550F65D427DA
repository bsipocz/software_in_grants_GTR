It has a life expectancy similar to some advanced, common cancers. There is treatment available but there is no cure. We now know that PAH is associated with weakness in the muscles in the legs, which contributes to the symptoms that patients experience. It is also becoming clear that rehabilitation can improve patients exercise capacity and reverses the changes seen in their muscle cells. These classes can improve quality of life and may prolong people's lives. Researchers believe that certain proteins found in high levels in the blood of patients with other chronic diseases can affect muscle function and growth. One of these proteins is called growth differentiating factor (GDF) 8, high levels of which are associated with muscle weakness in COPD and heart failure (HF). Interestingly there are drugs available which block the actions of GDF-8 on muscle cells which has been shown in animals to result in increased muscle size. A related protein called GDF-15 is found in elevated levels in patients with PAH, and is linked to prognosis. 

We started investigating the role of GDF-15 in the development of muscle weakness. In patients with COPD as well as healthy volunteers we found that as GDF-15 levels went up, muscle strength went down. We also found that GDF-15 levels in the blood stayed high after heart surgery only in patients who lost more than about 10% of their thigh muscle size. Furthermore we showed that the mechanism through which GDF-15 changes muscle strength and size is the same as that seen in GDF-8. Finally when we added GDF-15 to muscle cells they became smaller. 

We believe these preliminary results suggest that GDF-15 may be an important protein in causing muscle weakness in PAH and that it may act through the same mechanisms as GDF-8. We aim to test this theory by finding out where GDF-15 is produced and whether it is associated with muscle weakness in animal models of PAH. We want to discover what happens when we add GDF-15 and drugs that may block its actions to muscle cells, and to find out whether GDF-15 levels in the blood and muscles of patients with PAH are involved in the development of muscle weakness

The research will be carried out by a PhD student under the supervision of a number of experts in the field of muscle weakness and PAH at Imperial College London. We will take the tissue of rats and mice with pulmonary hypertension and examine where GDF-15 is produced. We will take the muscle tissue of these animals and analyze them to see the whether the levels of these proteins in the muscle is related with weakness. Next we will try and define the effects of these proteins on muscle cells and find out how they cause these effects. We will do this first by adding proteins to growing muscle cells in the lab and then blocking their actions using drugs which may stop GDF-15 binding to these cells. Next we will add genes, which cause increased production of GDF-15 to the muscles of mice. Once we establish that this results in muscle weakness we will try to block their actions by adding further genes which cause release of proteins that stop GDF-15 binding to muscle cells. Finally we will investigate the levels of GDF-15 in the blood of patients with PAH to see whether these are related to muscle weakness. We will also take muscle biopsies from the patients who allow us to, in order that we can examine the way in which GDF-15 may cause muscle weakness in men and women with PAH.

We expect this work will lead to a greater understanding of the role of GDF-15 in muscle weakness in patients with PAH. IN addition GDF-15 levels may be important in allowing us to define which patients have muscle weakness. We hope in the future to perform a clinical trial of drugs which block the actions of GDF-15.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We aim to define: the site of expression and the physiological correlates of GDF-15 levels in animal models of PAH; the effects of GDF-15 on muscle cells; whether GDF-15 acts via actIIBR or TGFBIIR and if antagonism of receptor function reverses the changes seen with GDF-15 exposure in vitro and in vivo; the potential role of GDF-15 in the development of muscle weakness in PAH patients. 
Experimental procedures
1. The site of expression and the physiological correlates of GDF-15 in the monocrotoline and BMPRII models of PAH will be determined through the analysis of dissected tissue and blood for GDF-15 levels using qPCR and ELISA. Changes in muscle cell size, structure and intracellular signaling will also be analyzed using light microscopy, immunofluorescence, qPCR and western blotting. 
2. We will expose C2C12 myoblasts to GDF-15 and analyse them for signs of atrophy and autophagy. In cell lines that respond, the intracellular signaling pathway involved will be examined through luciferase reporter assays and co-transfection with actIIBR and TGFBIIR antagonists. Next mouse tibialis anterior muscle will be electroporated with GDF-15 expression vector. Muscle size, structure and intracellular changes will be analysed. If successful expression vectors for actIIBR / TGFBIIR and follistatin will be electroporated and experiments repeated.
3. Patients with PAH will have their GDF-15 plasma levels determined and correlated with physiological parameters. Muscles biopsies will be taken in those who consent and analysed as in 1.
PAH is associated with muscle weakness. Our preliminary data indicates that GDF-15 is a novel mediator of peripheral muscle weakness. Our project may confirm that GDF-15, like GDF-8, acts through the actIIBR, for which there are commercially available antagonists. We would envisage that this work would eventually lead to the development of clinical trials to test these agents in man and may be generalisable to other chronic conditions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>wide ranging group of non-academics will benefit from our research. 

Policy makers
Elucidation of the pathways involved in muscle weakness in pulmonary hypertension may be the first step in recognizing the importance of GDF-15 signalling in patients with chronic diseases and muscle dysfunction. This may influence policy makers to assign research funding to this important novel area of study. Through continued study of this pathway we hope to conduct clinical trials of drugs or rehabilitation which may antagonise GDF-15's actions on muscle thereby improving functional status. This may, in the future, influence policy makers to adopt novel guidelines about rehabilitation in PAH. By allowing evidence based practice we can help improve the effectiveness of the interventions we propose. This benefit to policy makers is unlikely to be seen immediately but will be realised within the next 5-10 years

Industry and Charities
Our research will help define new potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of muscle weakness in pulmonary hypertension. This could represent an important advance for industry that could utilise the results of our research to develop novel products, which might improve patient care and may benefit them economically. If this were the case a successful drug trial could lead to significant benefit to the company and also contribute to the British economy. In the short term we would plan to engage industrial partners in our research by the final year of fellowship, from where we can explore the possibility of developing drug trials in animals. Our research will help raise the profile of our charitable partners with whom we collaborate, e.g. the Pulmonary Hypertension Association.

Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating disorder associated with premature death and significant morbidity. Recent evidence suggests that patients with pulmonary hypertension experience significant muscle wasting. Furthermore rehabilitation has been shown to increase performance on six minute walk test greater than any drug intervention suggesting the relative importance of skeletal muscle dysfunction in this disorder. By elucidating the underlying pathways involved in muscle wasting in this disease we aim to help develop novel therapeutic targets for intervention. We aim to use our research to inform clinical trials of rehabilitation and novel drugs which may be important in changing patient outcomes in the future by improving their quality of life and even reducing mortality. We may also be able to prove GDF-15's utility as a biomarker of muscle weakness and thereby ensuring we enroll an at risk group of patients into future clinical trials aimed at increasing peripheral muscle strength and size. We would envisage that patients with PAH will benefit from information about our important research at the outset and throughout this fellowship at 6 monthly intervals. Clinical benefit may come soon afterwards in trials of pulmonary rehabilitation and then longer term in trials of actIIBR antagonists.

Patients with other disorders complicated by muscle weakness and the public
Many chronic diseases are associated with significant muscle weakness. The potential application of our findings to patients with other chronic conditions associated with raised GDF-15 levels e.g. chronic heart failure, means that a much wider group of patients may in the future significantly benefit from our research. Prevention of disease is in the public interest. Our findings may be relevant to the general population. If we find that muscle strength and GDf-15 levels correlate with physical activity in both health and disease it may add significant weight to the argument that exercise can prevent disuse atrophy in both health and disease encouraging all people to adopt a healthier lifestyle.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>TGFbeta signalling in skeletal muscle weakness in pulmonary arterial hypertension</gtr:description><gtr:id>86F4DBE2-3ED0-4357-9300-85E51FBA67FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>nil yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>TXxBVbrLsQq-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Providing samples from models they have available</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I will be analysing samples</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>TAK1 inhibition in the MCT rat</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4EF6577-25DF-4612-9484-7B87A1350002</gtr:id><gtr:impact>publication and future research</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d0cd0126ca74.76356257-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>supply of animals and expertise</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>planned and organised this research</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit to Imperial College</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8667B1E-D10E-4675-8616-7B5136F8C553</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25 pupils attended a worskshop looking at biological processes.
