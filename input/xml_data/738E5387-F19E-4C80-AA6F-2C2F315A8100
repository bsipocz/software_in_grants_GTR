Disruption of such a balance can lead to many diseases including cancer and degenerative disorders. It is therefore important to understand how cell death and birth are coordinated. Recent work by us and others discovered an unexpected communication initiated from dying cells. Signals emitted from dying cells trigger their neighbouring cells to divide and generate new cells which can compensate for the cell loss. This process is termed Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP). However, it remains elusive how AiP is activated and regulated at the molecular level. The proposed research aims to advance our understanding of AiP. For this purpose, we chose the fruit-fly Drosophila which is a powerful model organism to investigate the regulatory gene network that mediates cellular communication in vivo. We have developed unique assays in Drosophila using either tissue overgrowth or tissue regeneration as sensitive readouts of AiP. These readouts allow quick identification and analysis of novel AiP regulators. By employing these assays we have identified 26 new regulatory genes of AiP. The functions of these genes revealed two key cellular processes underlying AiP. One process is remodelling of the cytoskeleton, the cellular scaffolding, while the other is called autophagy which is a process critical for the maintenance of energy balance in a cell. The proposed work is to determine roles of these key cellular processes and other identified new regulators in mediating AiP. The outcome of this research will help us understand how dying cells talk to their neighbours to induce cell replacement. As AiP is relevant to both regeneration (tissue repair) and tumour growth (cancer) in mammals including humans, the proposed work can provide potential drug targets for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In multi-cellular organisms, stress-induced apoptotic cells send signals to induce compensatory proliferation of neighbouring cells, a process termed Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP). Recent studies in several organisms including Drosophila, Hydra, and mouse have revealed that AiP plays critical roles in tissue recovery and regeneration. Uncontrolled AiP can contribute to tissue overgrowth as seen in Drosophila and tumour recurrence after radiotherapy as seen in the mouse. Therefore, understanding how AiP is activated and regulated is relevant to both regeneration and tumourigenesis. Pioneering studies in Drosophila have suggested that the stress-response JNK signalling pathway and growth signalling pathways such as Wg/Wnt and EGFR are required for AiP. However, mechanisms that activate and regulate these signals are not yet clear. By taking advantage of two Drosophila models of AiP that we developed, we have conducted a kinome-wide RNAi screen and identified 26 potential regulators of AiP. The proposed research is to further investigate the kinase regulatory network of AiP and, in particular, to examine roles of actin cytoskeletal reorganisation and autophagy, two key cellular processes mediating AiP that were implicated in our kinase analysis. This will be done through a combination of techniques including genetic epistasis analysis, immunohistochemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Such a mechanistic study will provide novel insights into regulation of AiP. Over 70% of human disease genes are conserved in Drosophila, and so we are confident that characterisation of new AiP regulators in the proposed research will be of central significance to the understanding of AiP biology and its implications for disease in higher organisms.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project fulfils a number of BBSRC strategic aims: &amp;quot;maintaining world-class UK Bioscience by supporting the best people and best ideas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;providing skilled researchers needed for academic research&amp;quot;, as well as potentially impacting on a BBSRC policy priority of having economic and social impact. It also has particular relevance to BBSRC's strategic priorities in &amp;quot;Ageing research: lifelong health and wellbeing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The replacement, refinement and reduction (3Rs) in research using animals&amp;quot;. Given the research topic is relevant to regeneration and cancer, the interests for and impact of research underpinning development of novel therapies on the society are high. Therefore, the proposed research programme is likely to attract public interest. In detail, the proposed work has the following beneficiaries:

1) The wider scientific community
The proposed research on apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP) is about understanding of cell-cell communications, in particular, how dying cells emit signals to induce compensatory proliferation of neighbouring cells. As such communications involve multiple cellular processes including apoptosis, signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and tissue growth control, our research will provide new insights into how these cellular processes can be coordinated and regulated which will be of interests to researchers in these fields. The unique Drosophila assays we developed for such studies are original and innovative, and thus will contribute to the scientific community as valuable research tools. For example, these tools can be applied to replace the use of mammals in the screens to identify potential drugs for tumour growth control.

2) Clinical applications and industry
Developments of efficient regenerative medicine and cancer therapy are major challenges facing our ageing society today. Because roles of AiP in regeneration are just starting to be explored, identification of AiP regulators in our research will provide potential targets for regenerative medicine. As for relevance of AiP to cancer, roles of AiP in promoting tumour growth and reoccurrence are paradigm-shifting because traditional chemo- and radio-therapies often attempt to kill tumour cells by activating apoptosis. Therefore, cancer treatments simply by activating apoptosis can be ineffective or even counterproductive. Our approaches to better understanding regulation of AiP may be beneficial for development of novel effective cancer therapies, i.e. a combination of chemo- or radio-therapy and inhibition of AiP. The new AiP kinase regulators identified in our research may also benefit the pharmaceutical industry because kinases are highly conserved and development of specific kinase inhibitors is one major effort of pharmacotherapy. 

3) Students and the public
This proposal is a good example of using model organisms to study human diseases and their underlying biological processes. The postdoctoral researcher, PhD, master's and undergraduate students involved in the project will be trained as the next generation of biological scientists with a variety of techniques and skills. The general public will benefit from the proposed project not only because of the potential therapeutic applications developed from our discoveries, but also because of our efforts to enhance public understanding of our research by engaging school students and participating in University activities directed to a general audience such as Open Days and Research Showcases.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435534</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Massachusetts (UMass)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>University of Massachusetts Medical School</gtr:department><gtr:description>Prof Bergmann - UMMS</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB16AE8B-208F-4C33-9FC8-315BBAE8BA26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.12.064.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb787f0f5284.47566855-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Share reagents and expertise on autophagy regulation complementing our research expertise</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Share our reagents and expertise on experimental assays and contribute to a research article recently accepted by the journal Current Biology</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Estates Division</gtr:department><gtr:description>Dr. Tony Southall - ICL</gtr:description><gtr:id>3EB12D79-0F6C-47BD-B220-C22C2D9AA06B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have collected the first round of the raw data.
