It posits fashion film as a unique hybrid of two industries with distinct practices, resources, and motivations. Its interdisciplinary approach provides a new historical and theoretical framework for understanding this important and increasingly popular phenomenon. To that end, the project brings together scholars with combined expertise in film history, fashion history and media studies, and practitioners involved in various aspects of contemporary fashion film production. 

The study of fashion film has been neglected in both film and fashion histories, and in the fashion industry it is often assumed to be a novel product of the digital age. The project redresses this by conducting extensive archival and filmographic research into fashion film of the silent era, and by subjecting these findings to a comparison with the practices of emergent digital fashion film in the early 21st century - another period of rapid technological and cultural change. We use 'media archaeology' as an innovative, non-linear method of connecting these two periods. Although not historically proximate, each period acts as a critical prism for understanding the other. More broadly, we will also investigate the potential of media archaeology approaches to 'rewire' established fashion history methodologies and to inform contemporary fashion practice.

Emphasising for the first time the transformative effects of film on fashion in both periods, the project forges a new understanding of film as a 'fashion medium' and as a 'fashion object'. It will make a major contribution to scholarly studies of the history of fashion, of film, and of fashion film, and will change how contemporary fashion filmmakers and other media practitioners understand the history of their discipline and the context for their own creative and commercial work.

The project team is based at Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London, and Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton. The project's methods span fashion history and theory, fashion in film studies and media archaeology. The specialist art school environment is a singularly appropriate milieu for this project because its research activities regularly combine historical and theoretical research with art and design practice. The team will work closely in partnership with AnOther.com (an influential online magazine owned by Dazed Media, a leading UK-based international media platform with a focus on culture, fashion and lifestyle), the British Film Institute (the UK's foremost body for the collection, preservation, exhibition and promotion of film and the moving image), the British Fashion Council (the national organisation for the promotion of British fashion design and media in a global market), Somerset House (a major arts and cultural centre based in London) and Moravska Galerie Brno (a major national arts museum in the Czech Republic) to ensure a broad range of outputs and impacts, and wide dissemination. The outputs include: workshops, a showcase on a contemporary media platform, a conference, an international touring exhibition of historical fashion film at Somerset House and Moravska Galerie, Brno, public-facing screenings and discussion events, and several publications: a monograph accompanying the exhibition, a book documenting the conversations between academics and media industry practitioners, and a special issue of the Journal of Visual Culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will impact upon the following: 1. the fashion industry, especially the field of fashion communications; 2. film archives and film and fashion educators; and 3. the general public. 

1. The fashion industry, including its media, will benefit from the way in which this research reveals the important roles film played in fashion prior to the digital era. Contemporary fashion image-makers and commissioners have generally had little exposure to the historical precedents of this form, and often regard contemporary fashion filmmaking practices as 'new' or 'ground-breaking'. As well as lacking a historical dimension, the emerging debate about the transformative effect of film on fashion is too often conducted between fashion insiders, with little contribution from experts and scholars in film and media. Our research will provide a critical corrective, opening a new dialogue with the fashion industry that includes fashion, film and media scholars. 

Our industry and institutional partners are included in the research process in order to test and ground the relevance and potential impact of the project. A new sub-sector of the fashion industry has recently developed in the online fashion publishing and retail sectors, resulting in the professional appointments of film editors and curators. There is a new need within the industry to pool a combination of specialist knowledges from fashion and fashion image-making on the one hand, and filmmaking on the other. Through the exhibition, publications, website, collaborative workshops and public talks, our research will generate a new debate about how the fashion and film industries have interacted historically, and how fashion film has served the needs of both. 

Our analysis of the filming, staging and choreographic techniques of historical fashion film will provide a resource for visual research for contemporary fashion image-makers. Fashion brands are increasingly embracing a range of non-fashion media and cultural projects in a quest to construct an 'overall brand vision' with a strong identity, and film has played a vital role in this. Our project will highlight that this kind of interaction has a history going back to the early 20th century.

2. The research will also impact on the practice of film archivists, and consequently researchers and educators who utilise archives. As a documentary and largely anonymous form of filmmaking, fashion film is often low priority in archival digitisation projects. Yet digitisation is key to preservation, access and dissemination. Our research will raise awareness of the importance of fashion film as a historical source and of its visual appeal. We will also share our contextual research with the BFI and other key international film collections, thereby enhancing the searchability and consequent accessibility of hitherto marginalised collections.

3. For public impact, the project draws on Uhlirova's previous experience of creating impact through the international Fashion in Film Festivals she inaugurated in 2006, and her contacts with prestigious partners, including Yale University and New York's Museum of the Moving Image. The touring exhibition, illustrated scholarly publications, public talks and panels, website and social media will generate increased public awareness of the fashion film in the context of the histories of 20th century fashion, cinema and media, contributing to a change in current public perceptions of the form as 'new'. 

The project will also change perceptions of fashion exhibitions, in which film has traditionally been used merely to augment the exhibited objects, serving a documentary or supporting function. The exhibition will redress this by putting film centre stage. It will thus highlight film's historical importance in displaying fashion, and reframe it as a major cultural artefact in its own right.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>299280</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004598/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
