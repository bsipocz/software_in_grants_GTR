One of the reasons for the failure of attempts to increase physical activity is the self-protective tendency to defend against messages that highlight personal failings. Research suggests that such resistance may be overcome by focusing attention on one's values and positive aspects of oneself - 'self-affirmation' (Steele, 1988). Self-affirmation has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of health promotion. At present, however, it is not clear how these potential benefits can be realised.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Four experimental studies will examine how self-affirmation operates and with which message types it can most successfully combined (eg those emphasising the threat or ways to overcome it). These questionnaire-based studies will also show how self-affirmation interacts with other techniques designed to encourage enactment of health-promoting intentions (ie forming detailed plans). These objectives will be pursued by studying the promotion of increased physical activity amongst 16-24 year olds. Given that the majority of this age group are in education, employment or training, participants will be recruited from educational establishments that offer a valuable opportunity for physical activity interventions.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174263</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sports centre advisor</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD0A482D-029C-452F-B464-045E60DAAD26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An advertising campaign based on links between physical activity and academic performance.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df0fc29d7ee9.78550776-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contributing to the research which informed guidance to the Sports centre</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PI met with and presented to Staff at the University of Sussex on a number of occasions, resulting in an advertising campaign based on links between physical activity and academic performance.

Self-affirming (e.g. reflecting on important values) facilitates open-minded appraisal of threatening health messages amongst those most at risk, but how does it affect those at low risk who are informed of inadequacies in their behaviour?

In an experimental design, adolescents (N = 125) completed self-affirmation or control tasks before reading current advice about why and how they should be physically active for at least 60 minutes/ day. The 123 participants not meeting these recommendations were told that this increased their risk of heart disease. Responses to the information were assessed (e.g. perceived risk, self- and response-efficacy). 

Moderated hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-affirmation was associated with higher self-efficacy and recall amongst relatively inactive participants, but with lower self- and response-efficacy, acceptance and recall amongst those moderately active. 

 While self-affirmation can be beneficial, caution is needed in its use when it may be rational to be sceptical about needing to change.

The research was presented to large audiences of students and staff at several schools. These presentations emphasised gaps between physical activity behaviour and recommendations, and discussed particular techniques for bridging this gap.
The P.I. has also disseminated findings to individuals who work with students at the University of Sussex:
Findings demonstrating the benefits of a message about physical activity and academic performance were discussed with the Health and Well-being manager. It was agreed that an adapted message would be added to the Health and Well-being webpages, and that students could be directed to this as appropriate. 
These findings have also been discussed at several meetings with the Head of Sport, resulting in an advertising campaign focused on physical activity and academic performance. The Head of Sport presented the research at a Health and well-being committee meeting. The P.I. also supported the Sport Centre's Sport England bid to encourage exercise amongst inactive students. 
The P.I. met with the Student's Union activities manager. Relevant findings from the project, for example the potential of self-affirming images, were discussed in relation to how these might inform planned interventions to increase physical activity.
In 2015, the P.I. also presented findings at a talk given to Sussex university sports centre staff and to University staff who were on an exercise programme. Self-affirmation as discussed in the context of encouraging enactment of planned behaviour. A further meeting was held with the organiser of a weight loss management programme at Albion in the Community to discuss the potential of embedding self-affirmation within the materials given to their members. This final meeting was also intended to plan a future ESRC grant based on self-affirmation in the context of improving intention-behaviour consistency amongst dieters.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E3B6542D-17C8-451E-AA12-E97A793470F9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5441241f07afa1.65976036</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Public health messages are often resisted because of the natural tendency to downplay suggestions of personal inadequacy. It may be possible to reduce this resistance by focusing attention on personal values, positive characteristics and social connections ('self-affirmation'). 

This project examined ways of using self-affirmation to increase open-minded acceptance of messages about the harmful effects of being physically inactive. A series of studies explored how self-affirmation works, and whether the effects depend on the target population and the type of health message. 

Key findings: 
? Self-affirmation encouraged more thorough processing of health messages, which in turn led to greater prioritisation of reasons to be active over the practicalities of achieving this. 
? Even when a neutral message was used, self-affirmed participants reported more physical activity a week later. 
? Initial evidence suggested that photographs of social groups may reduce resistance to messages about physical activity. This should be explored further as a potentially valuable method for enhancing real health campaigns. 
? Self-affirmation was most effective when combined with messages that explained negative consequences of inactivity without attempting to persuade individuals that it is easy to be more active. 
? Self-affirmation appeared to be particularly beneficial for those from higher socioeconomic status background, and could be detrimental amongst those who are more deprived.
? Self-affirmation was associated with decreased levels of activity and less acceptance of messages amongst those already engaging in high levels of exercise. This may be because self-affirmation produced greater sensitivity to appropriateness of message content.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project suggest ways in which self-affirmation techniques can be incorporated into future advertising and health promotion strategies. Following further scientific research, it is likely that health promotion practitioners could put the findings to use by using both self-affirmation techniques and messages containing information about physical activity and academic performance. 
In particular, we have a manuscript in preparation which offers a promising image-based approach to self-affirming, which could easily be incorporated into real health promotion campaigns (e.g. mass media advertising). Since defensiveness is a significant barrier to the dissemination of health messages to target audiences, this finding could have substantial benefits in terms of public health and the impact of future campaigns.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9439C73-2F55-4B01-86AE-D641833AECB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544122af76f986.34182629</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advertising campaign at a sports centre</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15BBDB35-F810-4DB1-8D0D-AF20B7B47EF8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6371935183.52875d23cbc3a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Disseminating research to an activities manager</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D456C8F-FEDE-41A7-85A9-1AC3A57D6521</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1769463170.1050913d23cbd66</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Improving information about exercise and well-being</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>117D1D9F-3B28-48DA-BCF8-9672D5CF3D88</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3363404351.6250367d23cb9e2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Participants were exposed to images depicting a social group either interacting or standing in line.
