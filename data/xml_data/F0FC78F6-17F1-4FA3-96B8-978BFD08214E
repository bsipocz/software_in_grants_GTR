It complements the ESRC Teaching and Learning Research Programme project: ?Improving Effectiveness of Pupil Groups in Classrooms?, which combined the social and cognitive aspects of groupwork into an effective social pedagogy. It aims to:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>establish an intercultural community of practice between English and Hong Kong primary teachers and researchers for the sharing of knowledge and expertise&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>In both countries, ten teachers will learn to apply social pedagogical principles to their mathematics teaching, while ten more teachers and classes will form control groups. Face-to-face and digital communication will facilitate the sharing of pedagogical and subject knowledge in the local and inter-cultural communities of practice respectively. Teachers? subject knowledge and teaching self-efficacy, pupil tests and classroom observations will form measures of professional development&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries will be the user communities of teachers and pupils in 10 to 20 primary schools in both England and Hong Kong, while several longer term academic, societal and economic impacts can be identified. Benefits, through links with Hong Kong, to the English teachers' self-efficacy to teach mathematics, and subject knowledge are in-line with UK government policy advice (Williams 2008; Vorderman 2011) to improve international pupil performance, seen as crucial to Britain's economic competitiveness. The Hong Kong teachers will benefit from English teachers' knowledge of groupwork. The capacity of collaborative groupwork to increase sustained pupil interaction and raise the cognitive level of discourse supports Hong Kong's current 'Learning to learn' policy to increase groupwork (CDC, 2001). This research will inform policy review and development in both regions.
In the short term, children's psychological health and well-being will be enhanced as groupwork improves attitudes, motivation, engagement, and achievement in subjects such as science and English. When implemented under social pedagogic conditions, the same benefits should accrue in mathematics in both regions. In the SPRinG project groupwork helped to motivate disaffected and disruptive pupils to participate in learning (Pell et al., 2007). This re-engagement will benefit these pupils' self-esteem, quality of life, and, in the longer term might keep them out of trouble, thus enhancing their own and their communities' social health. Training in how to work collaboratively, to formulate rules, adopt roles and practise argumentation, should increase children's teamwork skills, and hence their later employability, effectiveness, and ultimately, productivity. Beyond this, by articulating, explaining and defending their ideas they will develop communication skills and confidence to speak in larger assemblies. Long-term, these qualities of active citizenship will prepare them, at the wider societal level, for participation in local and national democracy.
The development of teachers' pedagogical expertise and understanding of how to implement successful groupwork will improve their effectiveness as public servants. Positive student attitudes and the capacity to remotivate difficult pupils will increase job satisfaction by reducing a time-consuming stress in teaching (Galton &amp;amp; MacBeath 2008) which affects recruitment and retention. Direct correspondence between teachers in Hong Kong and England, through the community of practice, and 'buddy' pairings, should culturally enrich teachers' professional lives, and, potentially create cross-cultural inter-school partnerships. Professional development through 'lesson study' is common in Hong Kong and being encouraged in England (Williams, 2008). It is inherently collegial, thus assisting impact and sustainability, and strengthening within and between school professional partnerships.
Academics in teacher education in both regions with interests in pedagogy, classroom interaction, cooperative learning and mathematics, will benefit from new data for the conflicting evidence on groupwork in primary mathematics. This project will tackle several sources of inconsistency in previous research. In the medium term, it will add to knowledge of the relationship between mathematical subject knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (Rowland et al., 2005). The resultant academic impacts, therefore, will be to enrich teaching and learning, and contribute to knowledge in this area. The knowledge exchange between Hong Kong and English teachers on mathematics teaching and interactive teaching approaches has mutual benefits for international academic achievement. Finally, the research will increase research capacity through training in systematic observation, and critical analysis of mathematics teaching through the application of the Knowledge Quartet (Rowland et al., 2005).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76388</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation  to Primary PGCE school coordinators</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A854F0F-7305-4934-B691-B0A5D3491397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk was positively received and warmly applauded, with individual commenting positively and asking questions after the session.

The focus here was teacher development, and the IAA funding allowed these teachers time to meet to plan and review, and to observe each other's groupwork practice in each other's schools. It gave them, in effect, 'micro-secondments'. It is very rare for primary teachers to have the opportunity to observe in other schools.

A professional case-study write-up of the research and impact work in the project was also facilitated by the IAA team at Cambridge, for dissemination within the University. It is available at http://www.ahssresearch.group.cam.ac.uk/SSIA/Casestudyhargreaves

An obvious pathway to impact is through the Teacher Training PGCE course at Cambridge. A presentation has been made to teacher training colleagues and over 30 placement schools' coordinators. The highly intensive nature of the course itself makes it difficult to include a specific session, but efforts will continue to be made to find an opportunity for this in the current cohort. 

The following digital paths have been used at Cambridge during the life time of the project, and are being updated: Faculty of Education website, http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/hkukspectrm/

a linked blog website, with teacher contributions, 
https://hkukspectrm.wordpress.com

a twitter account and a 'CamTools' resource area for all SPeCTRM teachers. Newsletters were issued in HK and England. A site with information and video clips about the project is in progress for the Faculty website. 

 In HK, an Early Careers Scheme GRF grant has been awarded to Dr Fung, a member of the University of Hong Kong research team, for research on groupwork in secondary schools. 

Several potential publications have been submitted or are in press but none have yet appeared in print. 
In terms of direct impact in classrooms, a 2nd edition of the manual for teachers, Baines, E., Blatchford, P., Kutnick, P., with Chowne, A., Ota, K. &amp;amp; Berdondini, L. (2008) . Promoting Effective group work in the primary classroom, (Routledge) will include SPeCTRM findings. 

Social and economic impact is more distant, but as more teachers develop social pedagogical expertise and use groupwork in mathematically challenging tasks, there may be improvements in STEM education, and children are more likely to internalise the skills of negotiation, articulation and collaboration in solving all kinds of problems, contributing ultimately to positive societal and economic outcomes. Teacher interviews, and observation findings suggest that these were evident during group work, and our findings suggest children's positive attitudes to group work. 

UPDATE: MAY 2015

A quick survey of teachers who took part in the original project and the subsequent impact project has shown that they continue to use group work in their mathematics lessons and typically have adapted their use of it to work with other age groups, other curriculum area, and for other mathematical topics. Some of them have shared the research with colleagues. 

One teacher, working in a very deprived urban area has combined the SPeCTRM work with another research project (ChiPE ( http://chipeproject.eu )) led by EC Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr Rocio Garcia Carrion, who has been working with me as a direct result of the group work research. This project introduced 'Interactive Groups' in mathematics in which family and community volunteers come into the classroom to work with small groups of children. The community involvement arguably accelerates the potential social impact of collaborative group work, and previously elsewhere has had demonstrable positive social impact. 

Following an invitation to participate in an EC ERASMUS+ project from CREA, University of Barcelona, this teacher's school, and another from the SPeCTRM Impact project have agreed to take part, and share practice with three European partner countries, if the bid is successful. This participation in research and development is a result of the SPeCTRM project. 

Publications, as reported in November, are under way, or submitted and still under review. Book chapters are in press. 
Several conference papers (BERA, BPS, APERA) and invited talks (LICE; LeCL, Spain) have been given since November 2014. These are both to share information AND stimulate thinking. While there are always questions and discussion, it is difficult to isolate specific impacts. 

Linda Hargreaves has been invited to present a paper on SPeCTRM to the ECER 2015 in a symposium for the Research in Mathematics Education network, September 2015.

The Faculty website and Wordpress website are being brought up to date. The Impact Acceleration Award funded the preparation of short video excerpts of children working in groups on a mathematics problem provided by colleagues in the Cambridge University NRich team (http://nrich.maths.org) with whom we collaborated. The video clips provide examples of the kinds of pupil-pupil interaction that we aimed to encourage, including making suggestions, explaining/ reasoning/predicting and so on.

Key principles of social pedagogy concern classroom relationships, teacher role, classroom conditions and task challenge. Teachers of ten classes were trained in social pedagogy and implemented it over a seven-month period.
Key findings, linked to objectives, were:
(i) In measures of teachers mathematical subject knowledge (MSK), mathematics self-confidence (MSC) and pedagogical self-efficacy (PSE) for teaching mathematics, we found: No significant difference between 17 English, and 20 HK teachers in MSK as measured by an audit previously used in England and HK. Only two of 16 items showed a difference, with English teachers doing better on long multiplication, and HK teachers doing better on a word problem about capacity. This is notable since the HK teachers were mathematics specialist teachers, including 11 mathematics graduates, whereas none of the English generalist teachers who completed the audit were maths graduates. There was no overall difference between the two groups in self-rated MSC to tackle the 16 items: English teachers were significantly more confidence about long multiplication and geometric transformations; HK teachers were more confident about problems on money and capacity.
(ii) Systematic classroom observations and post-lesson ratings revealed effective training and implementation of social pedagogic groupwork in mathematics. On-task working, and the quality of children's dialogue, such as asking questions, giving information, making suggestions and group maintenance improved over time and/or compared with control classes. In England, groupwork children showed significantly higher levels of sustained and higher order interactions, such as explaining, reasoning and predicting. Changes in teacher interaction and use of social pedagogic strategies, such as more focus on task than behavioural issues, more time observing children, and changes in group size and seating configurations were found in England. In HK, post-lesson ratings revealed significant moves towards social pedagogical contexts. Teachers in both countries advanced in their concerns about using groupwork in mathematics, relative to their initial concerns on the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM).
(iii) Teachers' self-rated PSE for teaching mathematical topics improved in both countries. English teachers' PSE for word problems, area/perimeter/volume, and investigations, (topics they rated as most suitable for groupwork), and for mental arithmetic improved significantly. HK teachers had generally higher PSE but for a more restricted range of topics. These are very positive findings given the short intervention period. Multivariate classification analyses suggest that teachers' PSE may be a more critical variable than mathematical subject knowledge in relation to pupil attainment. In HK pupils in groupwork classes outperformed those in control classes, but in England, a more complex testing configuration necessitated by a wider age-range and user concerns revealed improvements in eight of nine classes (medium-large effect sizes in six) but we could not demonstrate superiority over the control classes. This may be explained by the more common usage of groupwork in England.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Dissemination to researchers, PGCE teacher trainers and school mentors, teachers and LA advisors, and Masters students has included conference presentations for the British Education Research Association, British Psychological Society Education Section, and conference/workshops within the Faculty. Some of these have been joint presentations with Hong Kong team members. Dissemination of this kind will continue. 

A short report is to be written for the widely followed NCETM (National Council for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics) journal. A twitter account (@SPeCTRMproject) which links followers to other accounts about primary mathematics and group work was used during the project, and to keep in touch with teacher-followers subsequently.

An Impact Acceleration Award enabled us to deepen and extend social pedagogic groupwork in mathematics with 14 new teachers in four participating schools, and five new schools. This was achieved using the process of Lesson Study. 
The Hong Kong PI, Professor Kutnick is preparing a second edition of the original handbook from the ESRC-TLRP Effective groups in schools project (Baines, Blatchford &amp;amp; Kutnick: 'Promoting effective groupwork in the primary classroom', Routledge) for primary teachers which will include findings from the HK-UK SPeCTRM project.
