Research studentships are normally available within the Schools of Chemical Engineering and Advanced Materials (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceam/), Chemistry (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/chemistry/), Civil Engineering and Geosciences (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/), Computing Science (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/), Electrical and Electronic Engineering (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/eee/), Mathematics and Statistics (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/), Mechanical and Systems Engineering (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/mech/), the Institute of Cellular Medicine (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/icm/) and the Institute of Neuroscience (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/). Opportunities to undertake DTP-funded PhD research in other academic units may also be available. Major research themes are Big Data and Cloud Computing; Biomedical Engineering; Digital Interaction; Earth Systems Engineering; Enabling Research; Energy; Food Security; Materials; Medicinal Chemistry; and Synthetic Biology. Physics is a growing area at Newcastle. Sustainability and digital research are priorities.
DTP-funded PhD students are guided by supervisory teams consisting of at least two research-active staff and benefit from a broad range of training opportunities that can be tailored to their specific needs. Training in specialist research techniques is delivered within the research group and is complemented by a comprehensive suite of personal and professional skills development opportunities which span the Vitae Researcher Development Framework domains of knowledge and intellectual abilities, personal effectiveness, research governance and organisation, and engagement, influence and impact (see: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sage/study/postgrad/training/index.htm).
DTP funding is open to eligible applicants holding, or expecting to receive, a good (2:1 minimum or equivalent) bachelor's degree in a relevant subject. Opportunities are also available for academically excellent but normally non-eligible applicants to be funded as International Doctoral Scholars (https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/help/international/).
All applications should be submitted via Newcastle University's on-line admissions portal at: http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/. Applicants are advised to apply no later than January for October entry. Funding decisions are normally made in March. Potential International Doctoral Scholars must make an individual case for support to the Dean of Postgraduate Studies via their proposed supervisor. 
Five fully funded four-year PhD studentships are set aside for CASE awards each year (https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/dta/caseconvert/). Businesses wishing to collaborate on a CASE PhD studentship must be willing to contribute a top-up equivalent to one third of the DTP contribution (ca. &amp;pound;24.5k) and should be willing to co-supervise the student and to host them for three months. Businesses interested in collaborating on a CASE PhD should discuss their interests with Dr Trevor Bedford, Head of Science, Agriculture and Engineering Enterprise (trevor.bedford@ncl.ac.uk).
Excellent EPSRC-funded PhD students who are approaching thesis submission, or who have submitted their PhD thesis in the last six months are invited to apply for a Newcastle University EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/dta/doctoralprize/), calls for which are issued twice each year (advertised on jobs.ac.uk and the Newcastle University websites). Applicants must submit a novel research project in an area which fits within the EPSRC's funding remit. Each Doctoral Prize Fellowship is tenable for twelve months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3373732</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509528/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
