Such fields are known to occur in both the solar atmosphere, extensively studied in Glasgow University, and the terrestrial magnetosphere, of major importance for the BAS Natural Complexity Programme. We hope that it will still be possible to consider this late application. Successful Earth System (ES) science and policy requires us to identify, measure and explain the natural complexity of Earth. One of the main spheres of the ES is the plasma environment of the terrestrial magnetosphere. Theoretically, plasmas are expected to be inherently complex (Sato, 1996, Phys. Plasmas, 3, 2135), and research at BAS and elsewhere has shown evidence for complexity of the magnetosphere. Mixing and merging magnetic field structures will arise from the multi-scale intermittent turbulence of overlapping plasma resonances in the magnetotail current sheet; these contribute critically to magnetosphere energetic phenomena. Other, astrophysical plasmas will behave in a similarly complex manner, particularly the solar phenomena studied in Glasgow. Evidence of, and information about, the complex magnetic field structure could be inferred by studying the velocity distributions of charged particles that have traveled through it, whether via in situ measurements in the magnetosphere or remotely sensed via their X-ray and radio signatures in astrophysics. The study of the trajectories of charged particles in complex, electromagnetic fields is thus essential in understanding magnetospheric and solar plasma dynamics. It will increase our appreciation and understanding of complexity and nothermal phenomena in plasmas, and will allow us to deal better with their benefits and hazards. By 'complex' we mean here magnetic structures including several null points, with a magnetic topology consequently partitioned into many disjoint regions. Such complex fields may arise in plasmas driven externally by inflowing magnetic flux and boundary flows. By 'turbulent' we mean fields that include a random component, modelled as realisations of a multifractal or a fractional Levy motion model (Watkins et al., 2005, Space Sci. Rev., 121, 271; Saichev &amp;amp; Sornette, 2006, Phys. Rev. E 74, 011111) that may describe turbulent fields including coherent structures and intermittency. We have previously studied particle trapping, heating and acceleration at isolated null points (Petkaki and MacKinnon, 2007, A&amp;amp;A 472, 623), formation of multiple null points via superposition of force free fields (Malara, Petkaki, Veltri, 2000, ApJ 533, 523) and stochastic particle transport (MacKinnon and Craig, 1991, A&amp;amp;A 251, 693). The proposed project will draw on all this pre-existing expertise to determine particle distributions in highly fragmented plasmas believed to emerge in the process of reconnection. The student will: construct magnetic fields with multiple nulls, with and without realisations of a turbulent component; develop a code to integrate test particle trajectories in the presence of these complex fields (building on the work of MacKinnon and Craig); determine via many numerical experiments the circumstances (multiplicity of nulls; statistical properties of turbulence) that may account for observed particle acceleration in solar and magnetospheric contexts. The representation of the stochastic component of the field here distinguishes this approach from modelling using particular MHD simulations, and should lead to results of wider applicability than e.g. Turkmani et al., 2006, A&amp;amp;A 449, 749). The student will be inducted into research in solar and space plasmas via solution of a timely problem using state-of-the-art numerical tools. He or she will gain skills in numerical programming that can be applied in many other scientific and financial disciplines; knowledge and understanding of plasma physics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Fat tails&quot; talk in Glasgow Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36D2A832-B0B2-4EF3-BE80-2A11573B0FCE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 30 adults attended a talk on &amp;quot;Fat tails, stock market crashes and the extinction of the dinosaurs&amp;quot;. This was as part of the Glasgow Science Centre, on 15 June 2011. It described several uses of the sort of stochastic models also used for modelling particle transport in solar and space plasmas.

This kind of one-off presentation has many sorts of consequence for participants, mostly difficult to document and evaluate, and often impinging on professional roles so that consequences are disproportionate to the number of participants. One participant signed up, for the first time, for Astronomy adult education courses in the following winter.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5333564698bb63.03817131</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/?action=details&amp;id=5737</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have fed into popular talks touching on solar flare physics and astrophysical particle acceleration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C75A1837-58AB-496C-8188-EC898BD504AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def504acbf67.65266326</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Electrons and ions in space plasmas can experience forces of two sorts: forces due to large-scale electric and magnetic fields that change (comparatively) slowly and regularly in time and space; and &amp;quot;stochastic&amp;quot; forces that fluctuate randomly all the time, due to the electrostatic fields of all the other particles in the plasma. There are well-defined methods for dealing with both of these situations but the mathematical methods in the two cases are quite different in character, as are their implementations in computer codes. We wrote a new computer code that describes how particles evolve when they are subject to both ordered and stochastic forces simultaneously. 

2. We used this code to investigate the acceleration of electrons in the process known as magnetic reconnection, in which energy is released rapidly from magnetic fields and converted into energetic particles. Previous calculations of this sort ignore the stochastic forces. We were able to show how these forces alter the behaviour of the electrons, especially in regions where the magnetic field is weak - preferred for the reconnection process - and particle fates depend sensitively on very small influences. The situation we described might be help us to understand unexpectedly bright X-ray sources high in the low-density solar atmosphere, as studied with RHESSI and other space missions. It may also be relevant to the energisation of particles in the Earth's magnetic field. 

3. Charged particles experience a force if they try to move across a magnetic field. The net result is that particles in space can travel freely along the magnetic field but they are forced to move in small circles in the direction perpendicular; they are &amp;quot;tied&amp;quot; to the magnetic field lines which consequently play a major role in spatial organisation of the plasma. However the stochastic forces mentioned above will interfere with the regular, spiraling motion of the particles and allow them to spread out slowly across the magnetic field. We first tested the code by studying this &amp;quot;cross-field mobility&amp;quot;. Previous discussions have been statistical in character, giving the average behaviour of many particles. We were able to simulate the behaviour of individual particles, verifying the known rate at which this spreading happens and also verifying that it continues to be correct for particles much more energetic than the (thermal) average.

4. We also studied the acceleration of ions when the region around the reconnection region is &amp;quot;turbulent&amp;quot;. We calculated the electromagnetic fields resulting from the particular sorts of waves found in a plasma near a reconnection region, added together many of these waves to simulate a turbulent state, and followed the evolution of many ions to see what energies they can gain. We found that there are many more locations in the plasma favourable for particle acceleration when the effects of the turbulence are included - not just the reconnection region itself.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The stochastic RK4 method we adopted should be useful to other researchers in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas, in any situation where stochastic forces must be combined with a sufficiently precise description of unperturbed orbits. Similar approaches have been adopted e.g. to study dispersal of aerosols in meteorology.

Implications of our work specific to magnetic reconnection will be of interest to scientists trying to understand particle acceleration and especially X-radiation in and around reconnection regions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD10E763-7F17-4F6A-9C2D-9C90F3384A72</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56def438eae879.73827966</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A7B79DB8-02B1-42C3-9A1C-5CB9AFE95352</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effect of binary collisions on electron acceleration in magnetic reconnection</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa5e2d1263b082e3c33802326dcdf6f6"><gtr:id>fa5e2d1263b082e3c33802326dcdf6f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burge C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_26729__201322199</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A25E79C4-34E6-47AE-BBE6-3AD0C471AEA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Particle Acceleration in the Presence of Weak Turbulence at an X-Type Neutral Point</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Solar Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa5e2d1263b082e3c33802326dcdf6f6"><gtr:id>fa5e2d1263b082e3c33802326dcdf6f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burge C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_26729_012_9963_2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/G000816/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
