Academic
Knowledge based academic impact is described in 'Academic Beneficiaries'. The project will also build capacity in UK social science quantitive methods by bringing a international researcher with advanced skills and able to pass these on in the future in a teaching role. It will build capacity in Edinburgh University's expertise in using administrative data through working with the SLS support officer team at the University of St Andrews. It will also build capacity by bringing in a postgraduate student, Ms Anna Schneider, supervised by Prof. MacInnes, whose doctoral research complements the work done on the project through undertaking relevant literature reviews and the development, through appropriate training, of the quantitative skills necessary to undertake research on one, clearly defined aspect of the diversity of ageing experience. No resources are sought for this aspect of the project, which come through the University's Graduate School of Social and Political Science. 

Public Policy
Population projections show that the proportion of older people is rising in Scotland (so that the numbers aged over 60 will increase by 50% by 2033); that calendar age-based old age dependency ratios are rising; that old-age related public spending is rising and that all are doing so at a faster rate in Scotland than for the UK as a whole. In contrast to experience in some other countries, increases in healthy life expectancy have not been greater than that for life expectancy as a whole and regional diversity in healthy life expectancy (by deprivation quintile) is even greater than that for life expectancy. Moreover, population ageing has proceeded faster in rural areas, in part because of the impact of migration. Policy on population ageing, as set out in the Scottish Government's All Our Futures action plan, its consultation on Reshaping Care for Older People, lies at the the heart of many of its concerns. This makes it important to find better ways of measuring and forecasting dependency and understanding the diversity of ageing experience in ways that SLS data make possible: for example by distinguishing economically active and inactive older people. Our Pathways to Impact document outlines how we have involved policy makers in Scotland in the formulation of our research as well as sharing our results with them.

Actuarial profession and the private sector
Through the Scottish Government we have also been in contact with the actuarial profession, who are keen to better understand diverse mortality patterns and excited by the capacity of the SLS to shed light on them. Older people also represent a substantial and rapidly growing market, given their asset accumulation across the life course. We would expect our results, especially those bearing on the diversity of the ageing experience, to be relevant to the private sector's ability to understand the characteristics and likely future evolution of this market.

The general public
Population ageing and its consequences is not only widely debated, but relevant to discussion of the future of health, social care and pension systems that lie at the heart of contemporary politics. Understanding its dynamics more clearly, and developing a better public understanding of the variety of ageing experience and some of the contradictory implications of rising life expectancy is important for that debate. Our 'pathways to impact' document shows how we will feed into this debate through our links to the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Research on Families and Relationships (CRFR), the ESRC Centre for Population Change and our excellent links to the Scottish and UK print, broadcast and online media. We will also discuss our results with the Older People's Consultative Forum in Scotland</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142785</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Population ageing: the time-bomb that isn't?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>E9760FC9-EEC0-42BE-8478-7C95C387536A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Population ageing' has worried policy makers because for every worker paying tax and national insurance there are more older citizens, with greater demands on social insurance, health and welfare systems and increasing volumes of morbidity and disability.

The research has been used to develop better indicators of the progress of population ageing than the traditional 'old age dependency ratio'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3CDBB051-798B-40FD-9DA8-F1650244AB51</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56937e2c37dba3.04555233</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dissemination of our results: BMJ article</gtr:description><gtr:id>7074A566-81FC-4ADD-9CC8-7061AA7D19BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In our article entitled &amp;quot;Population ageing:the timebomb that isn?t?&amp;quot; we argue that current measures of population ageing are misleading.

The standard indicator of population ageing is the old age dependency ratio. It takes the number of people who have reached the state pension age and divides it by the number of working age (16-64 years) adults to estimate the proportion of older people relative to those who pay for them.

However, this ratio gives little sense of the impact of population ageing on the real balance of dependency as it focuses exclusively on only the first of two contradictory effects of population ageing ? the production of more older people. Building on research from others, based on large improvements in old-age survival, we therefore proposed to define elderly by taking the population with less than 15 years of remaining life expectancy rather than a static age cut off point such as 65. 

Secondly, we also considered that the population who is supposed to take care of the elderly is substantially less than the working-age population, but whose size is constantly changing because the workforce is driven by many factors other than age (e.g. many retire before the legal retirement age, while conversely the employment rate of women and especially mothers increased dramatically over the last 50 years due to a weakening of the ?male breadwinner? employment system). 

Using a static pension age for planning of public expenditure on social resources, particularly related to health, therefore makes little sense. The same applies for the population who economically sustain them as the labour force constantly changes. Our alternative measure, the Real Elderly Dependency Ratio, therefore adjusts both sides of the dependency ratio and gives a more accurate and very different picture of population ageing: the proportion of dependent older people in the UK and other countries have actually been falling in recent years. On publication we were approached by the Cabinet Office, Scottish Government, and other public, private and third sector organisations from all parts of the UK to discuss our research including the BBC and Al-Jazeira-UK as well as abroad (Dublin FM). Political Observatory and Project Syndicate (the latter with a claimed global audience of 130 million, but aimed at public and private sector policy and decision makers) commissioned op-ed pieces from us. We have paid particular attention to the dissemination of our results and flagging up their implications for policy to non-academic audiences, including the actuarial profession, policy and decision makers in health and social care, public, private and third sector organizations concerned with older people, and of course the general public:

We choose to publish in the British Medical Journal not only because of its health care system readership, but because publication here would bring attention from news organisations and transmit our message to both the general public and relevant policy makers. Publication on the front page, and our preparation of a press release and podcast meant our piece, received widespread worldwide publicity, television interviews, press coverage, including a piece by the BBC Home Affairs editor, tweets, retweets and blog commentaries around the world in several languages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7606295382.237337621ef574</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dissemination of our results: Scottish Affairs article</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9475F1F-FD46-4029-8473-F653BD262AA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We reject claims about the sustainability of current pension, welfare, social or healthcare arrangements which are based on examining misleading indicators such as the proportion of the population aged 65+ or dependency ratios calculated using static population age structures. It is better to examining real trends in employment or other behaviour. Such claims are more likely to spring from a desire to restrict the volume of state activity than a desire to truly understand the dynamics of population ageing. On publication we were approached by the Scottish Government and other third sector organisations from Scotland to discuss our research. We also published in Scottish Affairs, because its readership comprises academic and policy and decision makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5018326244.334063621ef7a4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dissemination of results: other</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5EAF1F1-0EA9-469A-9A0E-FD12240A7939</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have paid particular attention to the dissemination of our results that were published in peer-reviewed academic journals and flagging up their implications for policy to non-academic audiences, including the actuarial profession, policy and decision makers in health and social care, public, private and third sector organizations concerned with older people, and of course the general public, as is described in the summary of impact below. Creating public awareness of the fact that we should not assume that population ageing itself will strain health and social care systems, that all elderly are by definition dependent and that increasing the pension age is the best solution to the ageing problem. Demand for services will rise but continue to be driven by other factors, including progress in medical knowledge and technology that are more related to years left to live than to actual age. Another issue is defining ?dependency?. Many elderly today choose to have an active life. While saying that 40 is the new 60 may be a bit clich&amp;eacute;, in reality many more elderly are healthy (or alive) at their age then earlier cohorts, are big consumers (more and more now have holiday homes in sunny destinations such as Spain or Portugal to spend the winter there, something that earlier generations did not do because their life expectancy was much lower). In addition, many elderly contribute to society in non-economic ways such as caring for grand-children while their own children are at work or through voluntary work. Finally, while increasing the retirement age alleviate population ageing to some extent, there is still plenty of room for increase in older (55-64) worker&amp;acute;s labour force participation, for instance by eliminating forced retirement and ageism. Moreover as current workers perform less arduous work than previous generations many will be able to continue working for longer in the future, while new technology has always contributed to higher productivity. 

These are some of the issues that were discussed in seminars, interviews or in our own peer-reviewed and invited articles. MacInnes used his media experience to secure coverage in the Scottish broadsheet press for our articles and the well-attended Festival of Social Science event, hosted by National Records Scotland, and chaired by the Registrar General. This in turn was made possible by the close relations we established at an early stage of the project with NRS, which has enabled us to develop some very fruitful knowledge exchange not only with NRS but other branches of the Scottish Government. 



As a result of particularly the widespread worldwide publicity that our BMJ paper received from television interviews to newspaper articles and columns written about it in well known blogs including that of the Wall Street Journal and BBC Home Editor as well as on Twitter and Facebook, we decided to further possible social media impact by launching a twitter account @popageing. We are also in the process of constructing a project website for the research with help and guidance from the Sociology web design team of the University of Edinburgh.



We have also given lectures based on our BMJ article at University Master courses (one to Masters of Public Policy students of the University of Edinburgh and one to Masters in Health Policy students of the Imperial College in London as a result of a personal invitation by Lord Darzi, the course director and director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7671050324.729691621ef344</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Parliamentary University Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>A896A6AB-34B6-42D4-B763-4D2CD6ADD230</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In July 2014 we will address the Parliamentary University Group at Westminster to explain the importance of measuring population ageing accurately and why we think traditional ways of measuring is no longer fit for purpose. 

For instance, the Old Age Dependency Ratio (OADR), the principal indicator of population ageing, how many people have reached the State Pension Age with the working age population. However, its first weakness is that the proportion of ?working age? adults who actually work (and thus pay taxes or national insurance) changes over time. Youngsters now enter the labour market from education much later than they did even 30 years ago. Men and women often choose (or are forced) to retire well before they reach the State Pension Age. Conversely, women?s employment has grown by 5 million in Britain since 1961. Defining dependence by age, as the OADR does, has another drawback. As life expectancies increase, the meaning of ?age? changes because dependence is being postponed to later ages, making forecasts based on fixed ages unreliable. People?s behaviour come to correlate as strongly, with remaining life expectancy as with their age. Once we control for life expectancy, acute medical care costs have no correlation with age. 

Our own alternative index of population ageing ?the Real Elderly Dependency Ratio? remedies these weaknesses by counting as ?elderly? with a life expectancy of &amp;lt;15 years, and counting actual workers, not everyone of working age. This indicator follows a different trend to the conventional OADR after 1981, as the ratio of dependent elderly to the employed has steadily declined since then.

?Population ageing? and growing numbers of ?dependent elderly? is still a key policy concern but based on our results current and the likely future course of population ageing is far less bleak than is generally made out to be, with obvious implications for the sustainability of pension systems, welfare, health and social care systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2681702629.3666124621f0bc2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>062C3BA7-D100-422A-A9A0-BB043A9BCFCC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Population ageing: the timebomb that isn't?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ (Clinical research ed.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4ac7a82426f3c0ddee168f22d43526df"><gtr:id>4ac7a82426f3c0ddee168f22d43526df</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spijker J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-535X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc027c02759636b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA59F72E-AA15-47A5-9FC4-DF437712D5CE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hoe grijs is Nederland eigenlijk?
