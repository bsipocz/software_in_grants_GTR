In others, biological systems have inspired questions neglectedby biologists, but of great importance for the physics community. Among these standsthe study of what has became known as 'Active Matter': systems where non-thermalenergy is converted in the presence of dissipation into an effective motion. The classof systems considered is very large, including for instance bacterial suspensions,bird flocks, vibrated rods and - even further from physics and biology - pedestriansand traffic flows. These non-equilibrium systems comprise a large number of interactingparticles, that offer an experimentally controlled benchmark for non-equilibrium statisticalphysicists willing to confront new theories with the physical world.Currently there is no generic method to analytically study these systems, whosedescription has thus attracted lots of effort over the past few years. One of the majorgoals of this proposal is to address this important problem. One of the apparently mostsuccessful approaches has been to extend to these non-equilibrium systems thephenomenological theories developed for systems close to thermodynamic equilibrium.The underlying idea is to identify mesoscopic quantities (e.g. a density field) and topostulate coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations for these fields which respectsymmetries and conserved quantities of the system. The validity of this approach is howeverquestionable and significant results in this direction have been scarce. In particular,fluctuations out-of-equilibrium are not constrained by the detailed-balance symmetryand can generate much richer phenomenology. The first axis of my proposal deals preciselywith this point. Using methods established in other area of statistical mechanics, I willstart from a class of microscopic models and construct their fluctuating hydrodynamics,which will allow for a direct comparison with the phenomenological equations.Besides the phenomenological derivation of continuum equations, other ideas have emergedover the last ten years for applications to out-of-equilibrium systems. These rely on the useof large deviation theory to study fluctuations in macroscopic systems. This line of researchhas proved to be very fruitful. For instance, among the few general results valid out-of-equilibriumstands the fluctuation theorems, which can be read as symmetries of large deviation functionsand have given birth to practical tools such as the Jarzynski equality.As far as applications are concerned, large deviation theory has first been probed in idealized1d out-of-equilibrium lattice gases. These models have served as framework to test new ideas,in particular for dynamical phase transitions, which have indeed been observed in certaincases but are still poorly understood. These ideas have recently started to be exported to thestudy of the glass transition, with promising preliminary results. Biological systems and ActiveMatter should provide a perfect field to apply these concepts due to their inherent out-of - and indeedoften far-from - equilibrium nature. However, large deviation theory has mostly been limited to thestudy of single molecule experiments where Jarzynski equality is used to evaluate free energydifferences. For collective behaviour of biological agents, theoretical results are scarce mainly due to thedifficulty of analytic solution as soon as the complexity of the model increases, and to the lack,until recently, of efficient numerical methods. The second part of my proposal aims at exploring thepotential of large deviation theory in the study of Active Matter, which could open the way to moresystematic use of the large deviation theory in biophysics and bridge the gap between the two communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct beneficiaries of this proposal are a large community of researchers, working on a wide range of topics, from statistical mechanics to biophysics. The dissemination of the results will thus mainly take place through publications in journal of general physical audience such as Physical Review Letter, Nature Physics and more specialised ones such as Physical Review E, Journal of Statistical Physics and Journal of Statistical Mechanics. Although my proposal is best described as a theoretical physics project, the consequences should be very interesting for a biological audience too and I thus intend to publish in more interdisciplinary journals such as Biophysical Journal. Besides publications, conferences will be another way to disseminate my results. I plan to attend at least 3 international conferences every year, among which interdisciplinary conferences, such as BBSRC STOMP network or its successors, organised to facilitate exchanges between physicists and microbiologists. Furthermore, the various collaboration I describe in my Case for Support with researchers in the UK and abroad will obviously benefits both to the University of Edinburgh and to my collaborators' host organisations. Last, by developing this work at the University of Edinburgh, I would contribute to strengthen the excellence of the UK in the domain of biophysics and soft condensed matter. Beyond the impact in the academic world, it is always very difficult to assess the contribution of a theoretical work to society in general and economy in particular. There are however two pathways through which the work presented here can have impact outside academia. First, as any theoretical development in statistical physics, it can have impact in all the domains where out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics is used nowadays, from econophysics to sociophysics. Beyond this rather standard route from theoretical development to applications, one of the domain more directly connected to my proposal where theoretical development could have strong consequences is that of self-assembly of active particles. Indeed, most of the impact that soft-condensed matter has on food and cosmetic industry rely on the capacity of polymers and colloid to self-assemble. It is thus quite natural to expect that self-assembly of active particles, once mastered, will contribute to the development of new materials. Although this proposal is not directly connected to the realisation of such a new state of matter, theoretical developments on Active Matter will play an important role in any future application of this kind.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93D91CC1-9D18-4968-B6ED-6A1C9F8B4A6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phase diagrams of two-lane driven diffusive systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fe908793bffc58c38e75ab288435aea4"><gtr:id>fe908793bffc58c38e75ab288435aea4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0440440356fb8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8F2665D0-D067-493A-B894-5BA46F67DA40</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulating structural transitions by direct transition current sampling: the example of LJ38.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/742ff597c39233a5e363cc1d0fbaa2b9"><gtr:id>742ff597c39233a5e363cc1d0fbaa2b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Picciani M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d036036e359d97</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>78D5B19A-5252-47F4-86D7-E5B2FCEB9999</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differential dynamic microscopy of bacterial motility.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c41e5a4b451bc151ec1d85f6fef53d4e"><gtr:id>c41e5a4b451bc151ec1d85f6fef53d4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilson LG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0530537ca511a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DCF2A306-5AEA-4632-B631-8CF036597EA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lattice models of nonequilibrium bacterial dynamics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b2e606c7abd26ebb7b86026fa391727"><gtr:id>8b2e606c7abd26ebb7b86026fa391727</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thompson A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d044044015e16f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H027254/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9767B5B6-94F7-4DF6-8415-C15629D67796</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complex fluids &amp; soft solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
