When this need to belong is not met, there are serious negative consequences for physical and mental health. Indeed, loneliness puts people at as much risk of early death as smoking, and at greater risk than obesity (Holt-Lunstad, Smith &amp;amp; Layton, 2010). Loneliness is a widespread social issue in the UK; a recent poll conducted by the Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that &amp;quot;almost three-quarters of older people in the UK are lonely&amp;quot; (The Guardian, 2017). Given the prevalence of loneliness, and its negative consequences, it is crucial to understand the intrapersonal and situational barriers that discourage people from talking to one another, and thus constrain people from fulfilling their need to belong. An understanding of these barriers will form the basis of interventions to encourage more frequent - and more positive - interactions.
 
People generally enjoy socializing and spend a great deal of time talking, but in certain situations they struggle to know what words to say. For example, most people find it challenging to talk to someone who is experiencing a difficult situation (e.g., a cancer diagnosis, the loss of a loved one). It is said that in times of trouble, you find out who your real friends are; the people who let you down decide they're better off to say nothing at all rather than say the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; thing. What exactly are people worried about, and are there actually &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; things to say? This project will address these questions, and draw upon the answers to identify ways of increasing the frequency and quality of interactions, thus improving the social support people receive when they need it most.

My recent research has focused on talking to strangers - another situation that finds many people at a loss for words. I have found that, although talking to strangers is generally enjoyable and makes people feel connected, people report a wide range of worries about doing it. The proposed project will build upon this work by examining not only how people feel before social interactions, but also what they say during interactions. Importantly, this project will go beyond the single situation of talking to a stranger, to test the extent to which these predictors of interaction success (i.e., how people feel and what they say) are similar across situations (e.g., talking to a person of a different ethnicity, a wheelchair user, a cancer patient). Evidence of similarities across people and situations will prove invaluable in developing interventions to improve interaction success.
 
This project will begin by collecting descriptive information about 1) the worries people have when considering different types of social interactions (&amp;quot;fears&amp;quot;; e.g., their partner might not talk enough, or might not like them), and 2) the things people wish that others would and would not say (&amp;quot;phrases&amp;quot;; e.g., both cancer patients and people living with disability dislike it when people tell them they're &amp;quot;so brave&amp;quot;). Next, I will extract themes from these qualitative responses, and develop survey instruments to assess fears and phrase use. This will allow me to quantitatively examine the extent to which fears and phrase use vary between people (i.e., related to individual differences) and within people (i.e., related to the situation). Then I will run experiments to examine the effects of fears and phrases on interaction success in real-life social interactions, ultimately testing interventions with the goal of increasing interaction success. 

The research findings will be of interest to health care professionals, and a range of social organisations that work to fight loneliness, to encourage social acceptance and integration (e.g., for the disabled, for minority ethnic people), or to support people confronting difficult situations (e.g., bereavement, serious illness).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will uncover the fears that underlie a wide range of social interactions (e.g., talking to a wheelchair user, talking to someone who has been diagnosed with cancer), and test interventions to reduce those fears. The ability to promote more frequent, more positive social interactions is of interest to many groups:

1) Medical professionals

Knowledge about the fears that visitors have, and the phrases that cancer patients dislike/prefer will allow medical professionals to better understand the social interactions that occur between cancer patients and their visitors. This will allow them to encourage more positive interactions, with implications for the well-being of their patients. Although the research focuses specifically on cancer patients, the overarching goal is to identify commonalities across situations, thus the results should be relevant for all patients, not just cancer patients.

The results will be of interest to nursing staff at hospitals and hospices, but also to organisations that have nurses who provide home care. Hospitals might also wish to train the front desk staff who greet visitors and direct them to the right room, to provide information to visitors that might make their visit more positive, both for them and the person they are visiting.
 
2) Third sector

There are many social organisations that work to support people confronting difficult situations (e.g., bereavement, serious illness), to encourage social acceptance and integration (e.g., for the disabled, for minority ethnic people, for refugees), to combat loneliness, or to build a sense of community. Although these organisations differ in many ways, one goal that they share is to improve communication.

Social organisations that support people diagnosed with illnesses (e.g., Macmillan Cancer Support) will be interested in learning how to promote positive social interactions, since effective social support is related to better physical and mental health (Cohen &amp;amp; Wills, 1985; Uchino, Cacioppo &amp;amp; Kiecolt-Glaser). 

Social organisations supporting people at risk of exclusion (e.g., people who live with disability, or people from ethnic minorities; e.g., disability charity Scope, Global Disability Innovation Fund) can help reduce prejudice by promoting more positive interactions (Pettigrew &amp;amp; Tropp, 2006). 

The findings will be of interest to organisations that encourage people to talk to their neighbours (e.g., Talk to each other), especially in diverse communities. There is a growing realization of the importance of a strong sense of community for increasing resilience (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, 2013), and improving communication between citizens and local government (City of Vancouver, 2014). 

Loneliness is highly prevalent in the UK; according to one study, 13% of people report being severely lonely (Scharf &amp;amp; de Jong Gierveld, 2008). A better understanding of the fears that people have about talking to strangers could allow organisations (e.g., Campaign to End Loneliness) to promote efforts to address these fears in interactions with older adults, who are at an elevated risk of loneliness.

3) General public

It seems likely that the vast majority of people can recall a time when they had difficulty talking to someone. This research, which seeks to understand which fears are triggered by what situations, will be of interest to anyone seeking to feel more comfortable the next time they encounter one of these situations, or anyone who has goals that involve speaking to new people (e.g., connecting with one's neighbourhood and local community, making friends).

People are often encouraged to engage in networking, to build connections that might help with their professional endeavours. Networking requires talking to strangers. Although the proposed research does not specifically study this situation, the findings should nevertheless be applicable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239883</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R004838/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
