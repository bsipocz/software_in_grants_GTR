The challenges to counteract economic downturn in Europe have led organisations to embrace ideas of ?new? ways and forms to work. This includes rethinking job design and delivery including evaluating the global location of work. Aims of HbTW incorporate finding value and cost cutting on Europe?s own doorstep.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminar series has been organised by researchers from the UK, Netherlands and Sweden. The dimensions of HbTW that this seminar series will explore are the interconnections between Households, Community, Organisation, Management, Policy, Gender, Governance and the Virtual Worker set in the context of the European political economy. Each seminar event will draw on keynote speakers from ?seasoned? expert researchers in the field; early career researchers and also researchers, consultants and HbTW practitioners from outside the academy.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We aim to develop the themes of the seminar series into an edited book (targeted publisher Palgrave) and some selected papers for a special issue of a peer reviewed journal (target New Technology Work and Employment). Analysis of the gendered dimensions of HbTW can also be developed as a publication (target Gender Work and Organisation). 
We aim to develop communication means from the start of the seminar series through the development of a web site and publicity material including Quick Response (QR) codes which will enable academics, practitioners and those working in HbTW to access and contribute to the debates through discussion forums and blogs. This should last way beyond the boundaries of the seminar series and enable the core team to develop this field of research and contact the often 'hard-to-reach' HbTW workforce. Publicity using QR codes will also be distributed to employers who may want to understand how to manage change through flexible HbTW.
In terms of the ESRC our series will contribute to the themes of developing a vibrant and fair society and sustainable growth and economic performance. HbTW has important elements that can alleviate family poverty, provide a strategy for women at work in Europe to develop secure and lasting employment and to meet the needs of a restructured European labour market in changing and challenging times.
This seminar series will also feed into European good practice policies including the 'Customised Working Initiative' launched in the Netherlands in April 2011. This has introduced a 'Quality Mark Award' for 'model employers' for those at the forefront of introducing innovative flexible working arrangements, including the promotion of teleworking. The initiative aims for 1m teleworkers by 2012 (IRS, 2011). Good practice also includes the 'Equality is Quality' award in Portugal given when companies promote gender equality and in Slovenia the 'family friendly certificate' is used in consulting and auditing. In the UK the 'Employers for Carers' group promotes carer-friendly employers (IRS, 2011).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14132</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary: European policy on home based telework is complex and implementation differs by country. Austerity has impacted negatively on motivations by governments and employers to allow home based telework. The potential for positive outcomes across the board remain high yet this depends on safeguards and a holistic cultural change view. Architecturally and with regard to issues such as tax law, family life, well-being, gendered leisure and so on - the home/work boundaries need more consideration and joined up thinking. More research is needed.
We benefitted at the seminars of meeting a cross national (mainly from the UK, NL and Sweden) set of researchers from multiple disciplines - so home-based telework was reviewed from many perspectives. From a political economy viewpoint home-based telework is seen as a way to reduce the costs of estates and staffing whilst improving efficiency and intensity of work. There has been changes pre and post recession. Pre-recession - especially in the Netherlands (NL) - home-based telework was seen as a way for families to better achieve a work-life balance and allow for caring of children and others. Post recession it is regarded more as a cost cutting opportunity. From Psychology we discovered the psychological impacts of a blurring of work and home boundaries, potential isolation of workers and measures to 'switch off' and recover from work stresses. Consideration of well-being should be paramount. A very interesting perspective came from Architecture and the Built Environment where we discussed hidden home working and how people are adapting buildings and lifestyles to work from home. An increase in home-based telework requires a re-think in how homes are designed and has implications for building regulations and other employment based law. From sociology we held discussions on the impacts on family life, community and citizenship of home-based telework. Community engagement generally - and maybe surprisingly - increases with home working. From management studies, employee relations and home-based telework remains a challenge. Still debated are issues of trust, visibility and changing management practice. A thread throughout all the seminars was gender. Home-based telework has, for over 4 decades now, been associated with more opportunities for women to work and combine home working with caring responsibilities. However home-based telework remains a minority activity of mainly senior men.
In terms of research, it was clear that very detailed study is required. The European Labour Market is not homogeneous and research becomes complex because there are not standard terms or datasets necessarily to measure the extent of different aspects of home-based telework in different European countries. Multidisciplinary research is often a challenge - in psychology, many studies are positivist and draw on statistical analysis, whilst within sociology studies have been largely qualitative drawing on individual experiences. There are some mixed methods studies. However it is sometimes difficult for each discipline to appreciate different approaches and philosophies of research.
There are many practical impacts of this series and some participants were from consultancies and industry sectors. We have a book proposal under review as part of the 'Dynamics of Virtual Work' series that itself arose from a European funded COST Action project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Useful to employment policy makers, logistics design, workspace design and employment relations researchers</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B1640897-D20B-4688-850D-C8D22F87A2D9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ab1fc71d4628.85285418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EEC1925-1AC9-4B64-AB31-A08BDE8037D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Backshoring home: developments in home-based teleworking in the European labour market'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>n/a</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc1827ad58c4b9b6b695c41539bfe6ae"><gtr:id>fc1827ad58c4b9b6b695c41539bfe6ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>?
