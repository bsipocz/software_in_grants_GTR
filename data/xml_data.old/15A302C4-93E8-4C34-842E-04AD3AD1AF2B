In addition, the success or otherwise of economic policies addressing time related issues - such as the choice of the financing of the health sector, pension policies, etc. - rests upon the reliable estimation of time preferences.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>Although the literature on time preferences is very extensive, there is no consensus on what the appropriate range for discount factors should be, and estimates vary considerably even when similar intertemporal decision problems are considered.&amp;nbsp;Surprisingly, there is remarkably little work on assessing the relative merits of different elicitation methods in general, on time preferences in particular. We posit that one source of variation might be the difference in elicitation methods considered.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The objective of this project is to evaluate the relative performance of various incentive compatible elicitation methods of time preferences for monetary outcomes, with the aim of providing guidance to the pitfalls of competing time preference elicitation techniques. In addition, this research will lead to the gathering of data on time preferences.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a background work, starting from the consideration there are no contributions in the literature detailing both the theoretical and experimental issues involved with the elicitation of time preferences, and the connections between these two equally important sides (experimentalists and theorists tend to be two very distinct tribes that tend not too communicate between them), we have produced a detailed critical survey of these issues. This paper (a nominated output for this research), is being received positively, and is published in P. Anand, P. Pattanaik and C. Puppe, eds., Handbook of Rational and Social Choice, Oxford University Press, Oxford. We have also engaged in experimental work, focussing on the more widely used elicitation methods. The first is the Multiple Price List (MPL), currently the accepted 'gold standard' for preference elicitation in the time domain. In addition, the so called BDM and the 'sealed bid auction' are the most widely relied upon methods to elicit 'home-grown' values in the goods domain. The BDM has been used in this domain only twice before (once by one of us), and in a paper of these methods for the time domain. All these elicitation methods are 'strategically equivalent': from a decision theoretic point of view there is no difference between them, and a 'rational' decision maker is expected to behave in the same way in all of them, the differences being simply ones of framing of the problem. Contrary to this benchmark expectation, we find that the methods do differ. First of all, our statistical analysis shows that the money discount rate elicited with the Tables method tends to be smaller than those elicited with the other methods. These results also suggest that changing the stakes does have an effect. The effect of an increase in the stake is to increase the money discount factor for the MPL method (this effect, called 'magnitude effect) has been observed in previous studies using non-incentive compatible methods). However, the magnitude effect is reversed for the other two methods. This reversal appears larger in the case of Auctions: this is interesting, as not only Auctions are strategically equivalent to the other methods, but in the lab they have also been implemented with instructions and layout extremely close to that for the BDM, which is in general a harder mechanism to understand. It suggests that elicitation within a competitive frame (auction) and large stakes makes subjects more willing to give up more in order to anticipate receipt of their rewards, i.e. it makes them more impatient. Similarly, it can't be argued that it is the Auction experiment implementation that was hard for subjects to understand, as exactly the same design was used for small stakes auctions. Unlike the high stakes auctions, though, the proportion of subjects with a zero discount factor in small stakes auctions is in line with those with all other methods. Finally, we cannot conclude that those subjects with a zero discount factor did not understand the instructions, as we have a positive percentage of people with such impossibly low discount rates also when the Tables method is used, which is the most straightforward to understand. In summary, our preliminary results show that the MPL method elicits lower money discount factors that alternative methods we have investigated. Since the estimation of discount factors depends on the reliability of the time preference elicitation method, we hope that our contribution will open up further lines of research in the investigation of the relative merits of elicitation techniques other than the (so far standard) multiple price list format.</gtr:description><gtr:id>99E3685A-7143-49E4-9B52-C772316A9C59</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-86072487.8367711877613c0a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services/ and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2C098AF9-76ED-4D5E-A14B-2B3198C77E93</gtr:id><gtr:title>Procedures for eliciting time preferences</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7da6b25608d49e1d21662d789ed40543"><gtr:id>7da6b25608d49e1d21662d789ed40543</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Freeman D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d6513f02b31.50331046</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-1636</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-000-22-1636</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
