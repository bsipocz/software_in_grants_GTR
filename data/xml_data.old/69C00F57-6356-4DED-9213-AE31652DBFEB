This dynamic field of research is characterised by a diverse range of subjects and approaches: from clinical outcomes to the effects in healthcare settings and community health; from physiological to mental health benefits; from targeted interventions to the effects of broader arts in health projects; from time-specific arts therapies to the effects of long-term arts engagement; from the acute to the preventative and, of course, health being seen not simply as the absence of illness or disease (p. 101).

As part of the CVP, the Principal Investigator (PI) of the present project undertook research into the longitudinal association between arts and cultural engagement and health and wellbeing. This was referenced throughout the CVP report and informed one of its recommendations. As a direct consequence of this, the PI was enlisted as Researcher to an Inquiry instigated by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health and Wellbeing (APPGAHW). The APPGAHW Inquiry gave rise to a substantial report, which builds upon the CVP report to collate diverse evidence of the value of arts and cultural engagement to health and wellbeing across the life course. Launched in both Houses of Parliament in June 2017, the Inquiry report is aimed at the integration of arts approaches into the health and social care system.

The Inquiry process identified a series of impediments to the widespread uptake of arts approaches within health and social care, which the present project seeks to overcome. The Inquiry also hosted an extensive series of discussions - involving parliamentarians, practitioners, service users and other stakeholders - which demonstrated a well-defined need for the widespread dissemination of research into the value of arts and culture to health and wellbeing. The present project will draw upon research conducted as part of the CVP and APPGAHW Inquiry to enhance acceptance, in policy and practice contexts, of the value of the arts and culture to health and wellbeing.

The CVP report highlights the uneven character of the evidence base and argues for improved evaluation of arts and health projects using methods appropriate to the intervention and the knowledge sought. The present project will involve an exploration of forms of evidence appropriate to the field of arts and health, including those which challenge medical hierarchies. As part of this endeavour, discussions will be held with major funders in the field of arts and health, and the case will be made for the wider pursuit of appropriate mixed methods research.

As its name suggests, this project entails a comprehensive programme of dissemination and advocacy. Policy-makers and decision-takers throughout the UK, including ministers, Members of Parliament and officials, will be presented with a range of evidence of the value of the arts and culture to health and wellbeing. Political, health and social care leaders will also be targeted in a bid to integrate the arts into mainstream health and social care commissioning. The PI will work with APPGAHW to present the most appropriate research-derived evidence to the leaders of NHS England and individual health trusts, clinical commissioning groups, local authorities, the Local Government Association and Public Health England.

In a substantial and innovative part of this project, health and social care professionals (doctors, nurses, carers and technicians) will be approached with evidence of the value of culture to health and wellbeing. This will be done in a way that does not increase workloads, by intervening in major conferences. Passionate champions of the arts and health, including clinicians, practitioners and service users, will be invited to present arts and health work at relevant events, with the aim of overcoming a persistent lack of awareness of arts approaches.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following non-academic audiences will benefit from this project in ways detailed here.

POLICY-MAKERS AND DECISION-TAKERS
This includes Members of Parliament (MPs), ministers and officials. Ministers and officials in the Department for Culture, Media and Support (DCMS) will be presented with evidence of the value of the arts and culture to health and wellbeing, enabling the department to build its profile with the Department of Health (DH). Faced with spiralling costs wrought by an ageing population and a prevalence of long-term conditions, DH can benefit from this project by learning about ways in which the arts can meet the most pressing health and social care needs. The Department for Education will be given details of the arts aiding cognitive, emotional and social development. The Department for Work and Pensions will hear how the arts can help to alleviate work-related stress. The Department for Communities and Local Government will be informed about ways in which the arts can enhance place and environment. The Ministry of Justice will learn of the role of the arts in improving health and wellbeing within the criminal justice system. The Ministry of Defence will be briefed about how the arts can help to combat post-traumatic stress. Ministers responsible for such areas as mental health will be supplied with an array of case studies and examples of the arts having a positive part to play. MPs attending debates in the House of Commons will be privy to questions and answers illustrating the value of the arts to health and wellbeing. As a whole, this category of beneficiaries will be helped in their development of evidence-based policy, paving the way to sustainable arts and health activities in the future.

POLITICAL, HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE LEADERS
This includes the commissioners of health and social care services. They will be aided in their planning and delivery of services through better understanding the ways in which the arts can help them meet their major objectives. NHS England, NHS trusts, STP leads and clinical commissioning groups will learn of the role of the arts in improving public health, enhancing preventative strategies and managing long-term conditions. Local authorities and the Local Government Association will be made aware of the substantial part the arts have to play in meeting the health and care needs of local populations. Public Health England will be kept apprised of the value of the arts in meeting such objectives as falls prevention. This represents a step towards changing commissioning practices, which holds the potential for significant social impact.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE PROFESSIONALS
This includes clinical and care staff attending the main conferences of their respective professions. Delegates will be furnished with details of arts-based approaches, tailored to their particular context and delivered by passionate advocates in the field. Where appropriate, this will be accompanied by guidance notes and detailed case studies, combined with access to the PI and related expertise. This evaluated series of interventions will arm health and social care professionals with knowledge, confidence and enthusiasm for arts-based approaches, helping them to achieve better outcomes in their work. This strand of the project will also pay heed to the healthy working lives of health and social care professionals, contributing to the sustainability of the health and social care system.

ARTS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
This includes the many artists and organisational representatives designing and executing arts-based approaches for health and wellbeing in the UK. Dissemination of research undertaken as part of the CVP and the APPGAHW Inquiry will enable arts and health professionals to situate their work within the broader arts and health landscape and embolden them in making the case about the health and wellbeing benefits of their work, potentially leading to publicly beneficial commissisions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80302</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014623/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
