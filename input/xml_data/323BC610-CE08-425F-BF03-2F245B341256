For example, the 2007 UK floods were estimated to have cost the UK economy over &amp;pound;3.2 billion and resulted in 13 deaths, therein, two thirds of the damage in urban areas was caused by SWF. SWF caused severe disruption to water and energy networks, transport links, and other services including Local Authority education so generating considerable attention and comment by the media and public. The risks associated with urban flooding will increase in coming decades due to urbanisation, economic growth and climate change. The United Nations recently reported that urbanisation continues apace and the population living in urban areas is projected to increase from 3.6 billion in 2011, to 6.3 billion in 2050. The land surface and hydrological changes due to urbanisation increase the exposure of people to flood hazards. In addition, climate change is likely to increase flood risks by affecting the magnitude, frequency and timing of precipitation. UK regional climate models (UKCP09) predict increased winter rainfall and more intense, highly localised summer rainfall, the type of rainfall most commonly associated with SWF in urban areas. Much of the increase in urbanisation is occurring in emerging economies where significant economic growth is not matched by increases in flood resilience. The flows of goods, people and energy essential to continued economic development are at increasing risk of flood disruption. Despite its significance, urban surface water flooding is a type of flooding for which models, forecasts, warnings or management strategies are less advanced. The imminent and growing risk presented by urban surface water flooding requires improvements in scientific understanding, prediction and management.

This project therefore seeks to improve understanding and prediction of surface water flood impacts in urban areas based on field observation, improved modelling andimpact assessments. The project will develop cost-effective techniques to gather high-quality and real-time field data during and after SWF. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in combination with flood crowd-sourcing will be exploited. The dataset will be used to inform process-based understanding of SWF and to verify model development. The project will also develop new modelling frameworks and parameterisations for SWF which will lead to a robust numerical model with high accuracy and computational efficiency. The high-quality dataset at laborotary-scale and field-scale will be used to verify the new modelling tool. Model capability will be improved by providing better predictions and more dynamic information of the spatial and temporal variability of surface water flooding. Based on real-time observation and improved modelling of current and future scenarios, the project will develop a hazard impact model for use in decision-making, focusing on vulnerable populations (e.g. care homes and schools) and transport and energy infrastructures (e.g. sub-stations and roads). The project is to develop generically valuable approaches which can be widespread used across the UK and elsewhere for managing urban surface water flooding. To demonstrate the capability of the approaches, the project will use the city of Leicester as a demonstration site where the observation, modelling application, and impact evaluation will be undertaken. Based on the outcomes, a focus-group workshop will be conducted to disseminate the results and identify &amp;quot;adaption and resilience&amp;quot; pathways for SWF.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries from the outcomes of the proposed research include:
- Environment Agency (EA). The EA is responsible for flood forecasting, warning and mapping, and for elements of flood risk management. The project outcomes will support achieving sustainable surface water flood management. 
- Local authorities (LAs) and policy maker. LAs are responsible for urban planning, and design and operation of water infrastructures and emergency sites. The field observation and resultant susceptibility analysis developed in the project will allow priority areas to be targeted and hence help in the delivery of improved design and maintenance of the infrastructures such as urban channels, culverts and trash screens. Also, the decision-support tool could be used to inform decision-making in case of flooding.
- Highways England and infrastructure managers. Along with new rainfall and hydraulics data in cities and modelling, this will enable better prioritisation of maintenance and repair works, considerably aiding the resilience of transport systems.
- Industrial consultants and insurance companies. They suffer from lack of scientific evidence on which to base their advice, designs and risk estimates. The project will deliver a guidance and modelling for urban surface water floods from intense rainfall.
- Urban populations and vulnerable communities. The project will help to raise public awareness to, and thus to improve the preparedness for and recover from, surface water floods. Two-way public engagements will be able to disseminate the knowledge raised in the project and meanwhile collecting the feedbacks from the public. 
- Academic researchers. This project will produce a series of unique dataset and novel numerical methods which will improve the current knowledge and fill the knowledge gaps.

Various pathways will be implemented to create impact:
- Start-up meeting: It aims to help shape the project and engage with the partners from the start. 
- User-focussed workshop involving key stakeholders to conduct a two-way interaction: (i) to disseminate the project outcomes, and (ii) to transfer the feedbacks from stakeholder.
- Public engagement: This includes publishing guidance notes about surface water flooding on websites and sharing these via social media (incl. Facebook and Twitter), regularly updating research findings in a way of being publicised to a general audience, such as blogs, and attending Engagement Day.
- Project reports: Project inception, interim and final report that will describe the key research plans, achievements and impact, will be prepared to disseminate the project to wider academic researchers that are of interest and to local authorities and project partners. 
- Publications and presentations: The project will target to publish 4 high-quality journal articles present in 3 international conferences.
- Project website: It will hold all written guidance notes, reports, and datasets, and contain all articles, minutes and presentations, and links to relevant urban flood sites.
- University's activities, including linking to the Changing Environments and Infrastructure Global Research Challenge theme and the Centre for Research in Communication and Culture at Loughborough, e.g. talk through media.
- Teaching. The model and data in the project can be used to inform my teaching.

The applicant is experienced in creating impact via publications and presentations (over 20 papers) in the field of water and environment and collaborating with the consultant JBA Trust. In the EDRF, EPSRC and NERC projects, he has had the chance to participate in the dissemination of project outcomes beyond academia through impact activities such as stakeholder meetings, and engagement days. He has a mentor team (Dr. Yu, Prof. Wilby, Prof. Wood, Prof. Wright) with a broad and inter-multidisciplinary expertise, and extensive links with non-academic contacts. The team will give the mentoring and assist the impact delivery.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R007411/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44BF93F5-71F4-42EF-A39B-8A0F09C7DDD1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Coastal &amp; Waterway Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AECBB1F8-45A7-48B4-9FBB-31FE4206AA69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban &amp; Land Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19789484-D6B8-4965-AD25-309DD43054A0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Water Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
