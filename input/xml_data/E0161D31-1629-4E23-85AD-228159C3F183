The afterlives of this conflict began even while it was ongoing; new forms of war correspondence and front-line photography produced instant history and commemorative industries were quick to gather momentum, producing mini-biographies of military heroes (including George Ryan's 'The Lives of our Heroes of the Crimea', 1855), and collectables such as chinaware and commemorative statues. The project begins with a detailed examination of the National Army Museum's substantial holdings of such materials, tracing the different attitudes and responses to this war from its outset. The NAM's archives offer much scope to re-examine the origins of those issues that have come to inform attitudes to the Crimean War ever since; attitudes which, in historiographical terms, develop from two opposing positions. The project will examine the potent legacies of the condemnatory and justificatory response, the former vividly expressed by The Times' journalist William Howard Russell, the latter promoted by the first great historian of the war, Alexander Kinglake. It will then explore a number of key moments in the afterlife of this war, beginning with Queen Victoria's much recorded visit to the wounded soldiers at Chatham in 1855, proceeding by way of the increasing commemoration and eventual cult of the Charge of the Light Brigade, taking in the acclaimed NAM exhibition of 2004-5, and ending 160 years after the outbreak of the war. It will assess the ways in which the presentation of this historical moment shifts in response to changing attitudes towards war, violence and nationhood. 'Curating' indicates a central focus on the role that exhibitions have played in the critical (re)shaping of responses to this conflict. This element of the project draws on the expertise of NAM supervisor, Dr Massie, who curated the recent exhibition, and upon the existing collaboration between the VSC and the School of Museum Studies at Leicester on a project entitled 'Curating the Victorians'. This focus provides a new dimension to the study of the Crimea, through a recognition of the significance of museums and other cultural institutions in producing modern conceptions of the conflict. \n'Curating' here, though, is also used in a much looser sense to encompass a wide range of forms through which the war is re'written' and commemorated, including textual forms (journalism, life writing and literature), art, photography, film and statuary. Work on the literary reimaginaing of the war draws upon the expertise of the academic supervisor, Dr Furneaux, who is currently working on the representation of masculinity in this conflict. This truly interdisciplinary collaboration, then, both depends on the archival materials of NAM and on the specific expertise offered by this combination of supervisors and institutions.\nThe project will draw on existing work in a number of disciplines, such as that by Matthew Lalumia, Ulrich Keller, Orlando Figes, Hugh Small and Stefanie Markovits. It will add a unique study of the museum context, and develop the idea of 'afterlife', or 'myth and memory' treated in brief, by Markovits and Figes respectively, in an afterword or epilogue. As with the CDA supervised by Furneaux between the VSC and the Charles Dickens Museum, now in its completion year, the project is intended to provide the student with both a focused area of investigation and with the space to develop their own intellectual agenda. The student may wish to focus on a number of key personalities from the conflict, tracing the re-presentation of Lord Raglan, Captain Nolan and Florence Nightingale through time and different institutional contexts. Alternatively, they may prefer a structure that focuses on the key mythologies of the conflict, the charge of the light bri</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>An element of probable value to policy makers and to the public is the project's attention to what the different presentations of this conflict over time can tell us about shifting cultural attitudes to war. Given the recent and continuing involvement of the UK in major military operations and at a time when the British Army's redeployment (or 'scuttle', as critics would have it) from Basra and Helmand remain fresh in the memory, the Crimean War's lessons about the perils of overstretch are all too topical. Dr Massie has previously advised the Foreign Office in relation to a State visit to South Africa, highlighting the potential synergies between war studies and current foreign policy, and is often asked to speak to the continuing question of why the British more comfortably celebrate defeat rather than victory. The supervisors share a strong sense that historical and literary research can have a substantial effect in shaping current opinion in ways that can benefit the lives of individuals today. An aim of this research is to better inform the general public about war, its after-effects, the way that memories are explicitly shaped, and their effect on the wounded. Dr Furneaux has been mindful of the wider impact of her work towards a monograph, 'Queer Dickens'. She spoke at events for Gay and Lesbian History month and has set up a local network of scholars and activists, 'Queer Midlands'. Dr Massie has appeared widely in the media and, attesting to the enduring interest in the Crimean War, on the 150th anniversary of the Charge of the Light Brigade, appeared on the BBC, Sky and Channel 4. Last month, he was interviewed by the BBC World service on the responses of William Howard Russell and Lord Tennyson to the Charge of the Light Brigade. \nWe will support the student to raise the profile of their work and communicate it beyond the academy in a number of ways, including, initially, online profiles on the websites of NAM, the VSC, and JVC. The University provides specific training on presenting research to the media, and the Press Office will offer support in effectively communicating this work through a number of press releases. Both supervisors have experience of presenting their projects to a range of audiences, online, through the international press and in interviews. \nThe student's findings will be used to inform the work of the NAM's Sandford award-winning Education Department, which teaches 25,000 school children and FE/HE students annually. The student will be given opportunities to participate in delivering this outreach programme. In the final year of the award we will help the student to organise an online exhibition on the Museum's website. We will have an event to mark this, in conjunction with a meeting and presentation to MIVSS. Both supervisors will use their existing relationships with other relevant museums and archives to assist the student in making connections with wider collections and museum communities. We have discussed the project with staff at the Florence Nightingale Museum and The Royal Collection, Windsor, who have expressed their support and invited the student for consultation and discussion with their curators. We will also support the student to discuss their findings with other appropriate collections, including the Wellcome library and the National Maritime Museum.\nMindful of the need to reach a wider audience of the interested public, we will organise for the student to present work in progress to the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society (over 150 members). Similarly we will support the student to speak to the mixed constituency of Leicester's New History Lab, events at which have attracted attention in the national media, and to be involved with designing related events, as the CDA Dickens Museum student has done, at the festivals 'Everybody's Reading' and 'Literary Leicester',</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024305/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
