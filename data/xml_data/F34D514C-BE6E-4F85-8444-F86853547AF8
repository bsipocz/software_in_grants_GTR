In National Socialist Germany and German occupied Eastern Europe they worked in all branches of industry, in agriculture and as domestics in German households. The Wehrmacht and SS also deployed children in construction work on fortifications, bridges, roads and airfields.

While international research on the Holocaust and the National Socialist 'extermination through labour' programme started immediately after the war, only a small number of monographs on forced labour had been published by the middle of the 1990s. Since then, however, hundreds of research projects have been set up as a result of the public debate on German compensation payments. The majority of these projects have concentrated on forced labour in a particular town, region, firm or institution, but a study on child forced labourers has still not been undertaken.

This research project provides the first comprehensive study of young forced labourers in National Socialist Germany and German occupied Eastern Europe by drawing on a wide range of archival documents and former forced labourers' testimonies. It focuses on both the perpetrators, their ideology and policy, and on the young victims' experiences.

The research will identify the political, economic and ideological background which led to the deportation of children during the Second World War. It will examine the extent to which the forced labour of children was linked with National Socialist racist ideology, the Holocaust and the Germanization programme; and it will evaluate the participation of civil authorities, police and military units in the deportation process. Based on official documents, the project will assess the total number of young forced labourers, their age and sex, their social, ethnic, national and regional origins, and the professional areas of their employment.

Special consideration will be given to the working and living conditions of children forced to work in Germany and occupied Europe, their treatment by employers and colleagues, their social contacts with the civil population and other forced labourers. Child abuse, including heterosexual and homosexual raping will be investigated, forms of passive and active resistance explored. Finally, the project will discuss the experience of forced labour, liberation, repatriation and further migration as narrated in published and unpublished testimonies.

The results will enhance our knowledge of both Nazi Germany and German occupied Eastern Europe as well as on the situation of child forced labour during the Second World War. It will contribute to academic research on the various links between the forced labour system, the Holocaust and the Nazi racist ideology. It will also enhance our understanding of how the experiences of deportation and forced labour been narrated in testimonies. As such, the outcomes will be of interest to both academic and non-academic audiences, including the media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study will have impact on a variety of users and beneficiaries outside the academic research community, among them the third sector, international organisations, policy-makers, professional and practitioner groups, public sector agencies, and the media. Some of them are directly interested in my research topic, while others are engaged in the wider context of my research.

Three groups of users and beneficiaries can be identified:

Firstly, impact can already be seen in the work of international organizations engaged with current problems in the context of 'children, war and persecution'. In particular the UN 'Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict' has shown great interest in the study and in the applicant's research related activities (please see Pathways to Impact). These contacts will be strengthened and developed in future.

Secondly, pressure groups, public sector agencies, policy-makers and governments will benefit from the results of this research project. As described in the Pathways to Impact, the Polish &amp;quot;Association of Children of the War&amp;quot; has already taken up preliminary research results for their campaign for compensation and equal rights for all children forced to work, including those who had to work locally, and who have been so far ignored by both the German and the Polish government. Other groups in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other countries occupied by Germany during the Second World War will follow.

Thirdly, the third sector, in particular museums (like the Imperial War Museum in London, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem) and memorial sites (for example Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Ravensbr&amp;uuml;ck and Auschwitz) will be among the main users of the research project be it that the results will be used to amend existing exhibitions and information services, or that they will be considered when new exhibitions are being planned in te context of Holocaust and forced labour. The same applies to the media interested in producing documentaries and articles on these topics. The research project had already direct impact on an exhibition entitled &amp;quot;Zwangsarbeit. Die Deutschen, die Zwangsarbeiter und der Krieg&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Forced labour. The Germans, the forced labourers and the war&amp;quot;. http://www.stiftung-evz.de/eng/forced-labour/history_programmes/international-exhibition/), that derived from an international research scheme supported by the foundation &amp;quot;Erinnerung, Verantwortung, Zukunft&amp;quot;, in which the applicant participated in a study on the resilience of Polish child forced labour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35611</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My research on Child Forced Labour has had impact on the political work of the Polish 'Association of Children of the War' (Stowarzyszenie Dzieci Wojny w Polsce). This organisation advocates the rights of former child forced labourers, including those who stayed at home while forced to work for German military or civilian authorities. As both the German and the Polish government have denied these children any form of compensation and also the social and economic benefits granted to officially recognized forced labourers, the Association regards my research of &amp;quot;great importance in getting the same national and international rights and privileges as enjoyed by forced labourers deported to Germany&amp;quot; (Letter, Stowarzyszenie Dzieci Wojny w Polsce to Prof Caroline Gipps, Vice-Chancellor, University of Wolverhampton). In 2012, the Association honoured me efforts with its highest decoration, the Blue Cross of Merit.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AC44CCAA-313E-4803-AA3D-6AFE9574CCE5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544b5861695658.52186444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research project has been carried out according to the research questions, aims, objectives and methodology described and explained in the application.

Significant new knowledge generated
International research has so far widely neglected the fact that a great number of the forced labourers in National Socialist Germany and German occupied Eastern Europe were children. Based on the research project, it is now safe to say that at least 1.5 million Polish, Soviet and Jewish children (defined as persons under the age of 18) have been deported as forced labourers to Germany. Additionally, there were millions of children forced to work in German occupied Eastern Europe. Children worked in all branches of industry, in agriculture and as domestics in German households. The Wehrmacht and SS deployed children in construction work on fortifications, bridges, roads and airfields. Two areas of research have been of particular interest: Firstly, there is the participation of German military and civil institutions in deportations and in employing forced labourers as well as the various interdependencies between child forced labour, deportation practices, and occupation and Germanization policies, in particular in occupied Poland. Secondly, there is the experience of deportation and forced labour as constructed and narrated in former child forced labourer's testimonies, and its lifelong impact.

Important new research resources identified
Research was carried out, among others, in some Eastern European archives which shed new light on deportations and the role of the Wehrmacht but also on collaboration and occupation policies. Furthermore, documents in the newly opened archives of the International Tracing Service (ITS), Bad Arolsen, Germany have been researched. The monograph on child forced labourers belongs to the worldwide first publications based on ITS material. This has led to numerous invitations to present the findings at international conferences and public lectures in Austria, Germany, Israel, the US and the UK, and to participate in a public round table discussion on &amp;quot;ITS archives and the future of Holocaust research&amp;quot;, organized by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC, on 13 May 2014.

Important new research questions opened up
The research project has contributed to the emerging field of studies on German occupied Eastern Europe, and has opened up new research questions on forced labour outside the German Reich in general and on the role of children in particular. This has been acknowledged in numerous book reviews, including a review article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) on 14 July 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see impact statement.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9DB0DC27-F882-4E8F-8B85-F873E5AAF8FD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544b599146df48.00409791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>298051D7-5588-4A83-86D8-CFB363389D0B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children and war: Past and Present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/217d59632379a8ab843540cc9e51cff1"><gtr:id>217d59632379a8ab843540cc9e51cff1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helga Embacher</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-909384-47-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544b52aaa7e743.78770304</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E11537A9-B3C3-42C1-9EA7-727098ADF478</gtr:id><gtr:title>Med prisilnim delom in ponemcevanjem.
