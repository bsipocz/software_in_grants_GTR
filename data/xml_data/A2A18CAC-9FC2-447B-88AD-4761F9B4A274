Mild malnutrition leads to cognitive and developmental impairment, moderate malnutrition contributes strongly to general mortality, and severe malnutrition is frequently fatal. ||Over a number of years working in rural villages in The Gambia, West Africa, we have shown that clinical and dietary interventions have had a major impact on child mortality (&amp;gt;10-fold reduction). However, growth failure and malnutrition have eluded attempts at preventive interventions. Average weight-for-age in rural children is still 2 standard deviations below international standards. Head circumference is 2.5 standard deviations lower. Our early studies indicated that chronic diarrhoea was a major aetiological component, but recent analysis indicates that growth faltering has remained virtually unaltered in spite of marked reductions in diarrhoea prevalence. This re-emphasises the complexity of the diet/disease interactions leading to failure-to-thrive.||Most poor infants and children in developing countries suffer from persistent intestinal damage (tropical gastroenteropathy) as evidenced by a number of indirect tests and by small-bowel biopsies. This has multiple sequelae including: malabsorption of nutrients due to villous atrophy (especially lactose); energy and nutrient wastage in support of the inflammatory response; and possible breakdown of barrier defences against systemic pathogens. The extent of this gastroenteropathy correlates well with growth failure.||A series of nutritional intervention studies targeted at the age group where the problem is most acute (9-24 months of age) have all failed to achieve measurable improvement indicating, either that the problem is highly resistant to therapeutic reversal once it is established, or that non-nutritional remedies are required. These two possibilities drive the current research programme.||The resistance of established enteropathy to treatment indicates that the focus should be on initial prevention. Two studies to test whether the gastroenteropathy can be ameliorated by interventions initiated in very early infancy have been recently completed. These are: i) very early high-dose vitamin A supplementation of mothers and babies (new IVACG protocol); and ii) provision of probiotics to weanling infants. A third study of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation will commence in early 2007.||The vitamin A study showed no advantage of a proposed higher dose of vitamin A for infants and some evidence of possible adverse effects. This finding has direct health policy relevance.||A second component of the work focuses on understanding the aetiological factors and perpetuating mechanisms of the tropical gastroenteropathy. Severe malnutrition in The Gambia has been shown to be associated with an intense mucosal immune response, crypt hyperplasia, and impaired intestinal integrity. The intestinal environment is normally in a state of physiological balance, and dysregulation could stem from an imbalance between effector and regulatory cells. Lymphocyte populations and cytokine production thought to be relevant in maintaining homeostasis are being characterised using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. ||Mucosal lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production in severely malnourished children challenges the widely held belief of immunosuppression in malnutrition. This paradox is being studied using comparisons of mucosal and systemic immune responses including lymphocyte activation and cytokine production (by flow cytometry and RT-PCR) from mucosal biopsies, peripheral blood and mucosal secretions. Faecal calprotectin, faecal TNF, and serum and urine neopterin are measured as surrogate markers for mucosal inflammation and proliferation.
