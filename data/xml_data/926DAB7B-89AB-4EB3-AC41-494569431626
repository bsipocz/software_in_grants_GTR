Previous research has shown that a large part of the explanation behind these schools' success is the leadership and management practices of teachers and particularly principals. Despite this near universal acceptance of the pivotal role of school leadership and management (SLM) for student achievement, accurate quantitative indicators of these practices remain elusive. Put simply, we do not currently have appropriate questionnaires that can accurately capture the school leadership and management practices among schools in challenging contexts in developing countries. One of the reasons for this is that these instruments are designed primarily with a developed-country-context in mind and do not account for possibilities that are prevalent in developing countries and typical in challenging contexts. 

Furthermore, in large-scale quantitative research, existing measures of SLM capture effective or ineffective SLM practices in superficial and fragmented ways. When looking at existing quantitative models of educational achievement researchers regularly find that there is a large unexplained component despite controlling for school resources and various student home-background factors. This is especially the case in challenging contexts where this disconnect between resources and results seems largest. One of the tentative explanations for this lack of explanatory power is that we are not currently capturing the true leadership and management practices (or lack thereof) in these schools and that this is partly due to inappropriate and inadequate SLM instruments. This is the first motivation for the inter-disciplinary nature of the proposed study; that the disciplines of Economics and Education bring different but complementary perspectives to bear on this issue of school leadership and management. 

Our previous research on schools in poor contexts in South Africa showed that deeper insights were obtained by a comparison between paired sets of schools with similar demographic and locational features, one performing poorly and the other performing strongly. This matched-pair approach is discussed briefly below. The proposed inter-disciplinary matched-pair analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in either developing or developed countries. 
The current research uses 30 matched-pairs (matching 30 exceptional schools and 30 typical schools) because this provides the stark relief needed to identify which practices are driving the difference between the high performing schools and the average/low-performing schools in rural areas and townships in South Africa. The research will involve five stages: (1) Use population-wide assessment data to identify 30 exceptional primary schools (and their 30 matched pairs) in townships and rural areas in South Africa, (2) Conduct an in-depth study of 12 of the schools (6 exceptional and 6 matched typical) (3) Using the insights gained from Stage 2 develop new, more accurate and more context-specific measures of school leadership and management and pilot these in a different set of 18 schools (9 matched-pairs); (4) After finalising the new questionnaire this will be administered to all 60 schools to capture the SLM practices and behaviours of all matched pairs. In addition the team will administer background questionnaires to staff and students and monitor the Annual National Assessments in each of the 60 schools, (5) The final stage will involve validating the SLM measures identified in Stage 2, developed in Stage 3 and captured in Stage 4. The aim here is to use rigorous quantitative analysis to determine whether or not these new measures of SLM practices and behaviours are systematically related and specifically their predictive or explanatory power.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The ultimate beneficiaries of this research are millions of primary school children in South African rural areas and townships, and those in similar contexts across Africa. The insights and understandings generated from this research will help researchers and policy makers to understand which elements of school leadership and management are most central to success in challenging contexts. This research will also systematically engage with the public and civil society, as public perceptions and civil society groups frequently pressurise government to select certain policy issues to pursue, but also because an explicit aim of the research is to highlight to the public that exceptional schools do exist even in challenging contexts. Although the primary beneficiary of a new, more contextually relevant School Leadership and Management (SLM) instrument would be researchers and government officials, some in civil society have also expressed interest. The Dept of Basic Education regularly conducts sample-based surveys of educational achievement and administers traditional SLM questionnaires. Similarly, those in civil society engaged in school improvement projects often request existing survey instruments to assess possible schools for interventions. The new SLM instrument would be made publicly available to all.

How will they benefit from this research?
Policy-makers, researchers, civil society and children in challenging contexts will benefit in two main ways. (1) As existing measures of SLM school leadership and management (SLM) are inadequate and not sufficiently contextually relevant, a new SLM questionnaire will help researchers and policy makers to identify the true management practices and behaviours and where these are present or absent in schools in challenging contexts. This allows them to focus their interventions (both for capacity-building and accountability) accordingly. (2) Due to the dire state of education in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, most research in the region focuses on the majority of underperforming schools. While this is necessary, it can have the unintended consequence of creating a 'deficit discourse' where the public and policy makers do not believe change is possible. Consequently there is a need for research that provides alternative narratives and frames for schools in the region. Identifying, describing and analysing schools that perform well in spite of severe and challenging contexts is academically important, but also has the potential for broader social impact. Showing how and why principals and teachers achieve excellent results in rural areas and townships can illustrate to policy-makers and the public that some schools can and do overcome their circumstances. The importance of this has been confirmed in our conversations with policy makers in Presidency and the Dept of Basic Education in SA, who clearly indicated that they would strongly support research that builds on and promotes the agency of teachers and principals.

What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this activity?
The research team has extensive experience in engaging with policy makers and civil society in a way that translates research outcomes into tangible, actionable steps. This includes hosting round-tables and workshops with policy makers and researchers in South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Our team is fortunate in having frequent interaction with local and regional policy makers, having sat on Ministerial Task Teams and advisory committees, as well as holding influential positions in government and academia. The PI is the South African NRF Research Chair in Social Policy and advises both the Presidency and the Dept of Basic Education on a regular basis. The team regularly engages with the public through the media (op-eds, radio and television) and is well-versed in research communication and dissemination strategies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01023X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
