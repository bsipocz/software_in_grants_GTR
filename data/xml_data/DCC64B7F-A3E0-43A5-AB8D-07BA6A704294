We also maintain an archive of all received data for long time-series requirements and support public engagement through web based access to image products.

With new satellites such MetOp and NPP producing higher volumes of data than before, the time to process data we receive with our existing computer systems has increased significantly. A cluster of processing servers would allow much faster processing (in minutes rather than hours) with resulting products available to users more quickly. This is particularly important for near real-time users we support such as NERC research cruises and aircraft campaigns.

Improved processing capability would also allow additional products to be created from our data (both new and archive) using software available to direct broadcast satellite ground-stations such as Dundee. For example, possible products for Atmospheric studies include cloud top pressure/temperature, optical depth/effective radius and total precipitable water, and for Terrestrial and Earth applications they include reflectance, soil moisture, ice cover and surface temperature products. These would supplement Marine products already derived from our data by our NEODAAS partners at PML.

The web server is necessary to replace a very old server to handle the increased load created by more products and demand for these from more users. The UPS battery back-up is essential to ensure that the whole system remains functional during power glitches and outages.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our data and products underpin the impact of research carried out by users such as studies of
hazardous weather. The addition of new products including those for specific science applications will
enhance this underpinning effect. Some international users undertake downstream processing of our
data for active monitoring of wildfires, volcanoes and sea-ice, for example. The assets requested would
provide an opportunity for us to create products locally that could be used for this type of activity.
We contribute to public awareness of environmental issues as our website attracts a high proportion of
these users. Our imagery is also used regularly by media, government agencies and others to
communicate the impact of significant events. A greater range of products and website facilities will
increase this contribution.
Any of our products could be made available to CEMS/JASMIN and the Satellite Applications Catapult.
Dundee would provide data that can be analysed using the tools/facilities available at these sites and
for potential development of applications and services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Plymouth Marine Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>NEODAAS Big Data</gtr:description><gtr:id>490BE09D-8885-426E-92BD-450572DBEE57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Supply of near real-time Earth Observation data to Marine Science community subsequently used in many publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464cf9531ae70.91190509-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>As above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We work in partnership with Plymouth Marine Laboratory to provide the NEODAAS facility. NEODAAS data and products underpin the impact of research carried out by our users who may be considered collaborators.

Research areas for our users are Marine (supported via NEODAAS-PML use of our data) and Atmospheric, while Terrestrial, Earth and Polar scientists also use our data. This award has been used to provide continuity of products and services from existing and new satellites for our partners and users.

This capital award facilitated the purchase of a cluster of data-processing servers and replacement web servers. These systems have been installed and integrated into our operations. The processing servers are used for converting EO data we receive directly from satellites into environmental science products in near real-time. They have significantly improved our capability to do this so that products are available to our users and NEODAAS partners shortly after data have been received from the satellites. This is critical for users with near-real time data requirements such as marine research cruises, research aircraft flights and assessing weather conditions. It is also significant because new satellites are producing higher volumes of data than before which requires increased processing power. The web servers support delivery of the products to our users as both science data and as viewable images.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8B249363-7AF4-4C92-9E87-CEC2211D8764</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Faster access to data products to service users including UK environmental scientists covering marine, atmospheric, terrestrial and Earth science.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464cd5c6846d2.34685214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Earth Observation Big Data Processing System</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physical Model/Kit</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/L012987/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4504C6B4-D825-4F14-B0D3-7931AC636B71</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Remote Sensing &amp; Earth Obs.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
