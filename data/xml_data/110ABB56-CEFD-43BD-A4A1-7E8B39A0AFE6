Partner 3 has built a collection of 200 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the standard laboratory isolate of C. elegans (N2 Bristol) and a genetically and phenotypically divergent isolate from Hawaii (CB4856). These lines show extensive variation in stress tolerance and lifespan (see description to WP3) and provide a fantastic resource for eQTL analysis. Partner 1 comprises PIs who have led the study of stress-adaptive phenotypes rather than just response phenotype, as well as those who have developed databases of gene/longevity relationships and gene pathway and network modelling approaches. Partners 2 and 4 have led the field in constructing and analyzing network models and Partner 5 has developed novel network design techniques for comparative analysis of networks. Our project will combine the expertise of these 5 partners to build, analyze and iteratively test predictive models for the networks that underlie stress tolerance and lifespan.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Systems biology aims to model quantitatively how complex systems work, the resulting model being refined by means of an iterative loop of experimental testing and further modeling.

Molecular and quantitative geneticists within this EU-wide group will work together with modelers to connect the dots from genome to phenotype, and on to predictive uses in biomedicine and healthcare. Timeliness Our approach, of using the simplest animal system, of iterative experimentation and model building, and of directly linking eQTLs to phenotypic outcomes provides an unrivaled opportunity to dissect a naturally variant regulatory network. In contrast to work in mammals, it is the ease and speed of iterative experimental testing and validation that makes our project particularly powerful in advancing the model describing regulatory interactions. This approach is leveraged by the availability of cheap whole genome sequencing, advanced models for network analysis and construction, and rapid methods for directed perturbation and validation experiments. The time is now ripe for the application of this approach to a complex system such as stress and longevity regulation in C. elegans. Members of our consortium are international leaders in the construction and integration (Nature Genetics 40: 181-8), biological (Nature 431: 308-12, Nature Genetics 36: 492-6) and statistical (Phys Rev E 72: 011903, 78: 020901) analysis of networks. Combined with our expertise in the stress response (PNAS 101: 16970-5, 103: 2977-8), high-throughput (Nature Genetics 38: 896-903), and quantitative eQTL analysis (PLoS Genetics 2: e22, 3:e34), this places us in a unique position to undertake this project as an integrated team and to drive forward this area of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>409121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This ERASysBio+ programme was initiated and led from the PI in Liverpool, combining with 4 other groups across the EU. This programme has been successful in reaching its objectives. We have devised new mathematical approaches to modelling network structures, we have used nextgen sequencing to give whole genopme sequences for ~150 C. elegans recombinant inbred lines, and used these to identify thousands of eQTLs. We have devised procedures for prioritising eQTLs for specific phenotypes including longevity, resulting in identification of novel key regulatory genes that have been shown to control lifespan in animals subjected to stress pretreatment. We verify the eQTL approach based on intensive network modelling, and iteration thereafter. Paper in submission with Science.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This was a proof of principle exploration grant, which was successful. It needs wider application to generate sufficient new targets for exploration within a healthcare context. Of particular note is the fact that we have defined the first longevity regulatory gene whose effectiveness is influenced by natural genetic variation in wild stocks. Previous work was based on targeted mutation. This indicates that there are natural variants which can indicate novel targets in a number of healthcare-relevant phenotypes, but this is not near market!</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>134B3972-99B7-4DDF-8476-74FF43AEB867</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647e8e995f87.42227426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33E1EEC2-F9FC-4CA2-AECD-0317E3EFC8A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remarkably Divergent Regions Punctuate the Genome Assembly of the Caenorhabditis elegans Hawaiian Strain CB4856.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c2b8906acf9d8bef28b05b304823fe2c"><gtr:id>c2b8906acf9d8bef28b05b304823fe2c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thompson OA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-6731</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56def95f5a1fb0.23463822</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>884E0437-9EF9-4977-BA02-8F1F52B57F5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contribution of trans regulatory eQTL to cryptic genetic variation in C. elegans.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC genomics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4b8f23bd132a44cece69fdd710b1403a"><gtr:id>4b8f23bd132a44cece69fdd710b1403a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snoek BL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2164</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7915a8de8f2.71106593</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>048C850B-3EB5-43B4-B74F-94A92A6BE35B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A rapid and massive gene expression shift marking adolescent transition in C. elegans.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ef98af4dedf3d90fb074dd47fd26b20"><gtr:id>8ef98af4dedf3d90fb074dd47fd26b20</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snoek LB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545babd4bdbf43.73555991</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I004815/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
