Consequently, robotic assistant applications are confined either to research labs or, in practice, to scenarios where physical interaction with humans is purposely limited, e.g. surveillance, transport or entertainment (e.g. museums).

In the domestic/personal domain, however, interactions take place in an informal, unstructured, and typically highly complex way. Even in more constrained industrial settings, the need for reduced manufacturing costs is motivating the creation of robots capable of much greater flexibility and intelligence. These robots need to work near to, be taught by, and perhaps even interact physically with, human co-workers.

So, how can we enhance robots so that they can participate in sophisticated interactions with humans in a safe and trustworthy manner? This is a fundamental research question that must be addressed before the traditional physical safety barrier between the robot and the human can be removed, which is essential for close-proximity human-robot interactions. How, then, might we establish such safety arguments? Intrinsically safe robots must incorporate safety at all levels (mechanical; control; and human interaction). There has been some work on safety at lower, mechanical, levels to severely restrict movements near humans, without regard to whether the movements are &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; or not. Crucially, no one has yet tackled the high-level behaviours of robotic assistants during interaction with humans, i.e. not only whether the robot makes safe moves, but whether it knowingly or deliberately makes unsafe moves. This is the focus of our project.

Formal verification exhaustively analyses all of the robot's possible choices, but uses a vastly simplified environmental model. Simulation-based testing of robot-human interactions can be carried out in a fast, directed way and involves a much more realistic environmental model, but is essentially selective and does not take into account true human interaction. Formative user evaluation provides exactly this validation, constructing a comprehensive analysis from the human participant's point of view.

It is the aim of our project to bring these three approaches together to tackle the holistic analysis of safety in human-robot interactions. This will require significant research in enhancing each of the, very distinct, approaches so they can work together and subsequently be applied in realistic human-robot scenarios. This has not previously been achieved. Developing strong links between the techniques, for example through formal assertions and interaction hypotheses, together with extension of the basic techniques to cope with practical robotics, is the core part of our research.

Though non-trivial to achieve, this combined approach will be very powerful. Not only will analysis from one technique stimulate new explorations for the others, but each distinct technique actually remedies some of the deficiencies of another. Thus, this combination provides a new, strong, comprehensive, end-to-end verification and validation method for assessing safety in human-robot interactions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>396537</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Computer Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Network on the Verification and Validation of Autonomous Systems</gtr:description><gtr:id>95C515BC-6976-4320-BE74-D0E3DCD4B37B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>community building to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9da6c04ba57.79469227-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Leading network activities, organising networking events, community building, dissemination, research roadmap shaping, etc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Presentations on the state of the art of test-based verification techniques, participation and contribution to networking events, organisation of a workshop.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Verification and Validation of Sensing and Control Models in Autonomous Systems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28B27472-0C8F-490B-89C2-C29967A5E6BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was held as part of the EPSRC funded V&amp;amp;V Network.

Contribution of the session entitled &amp;quot;Practical Techniques for Verification and Validation of Robots&amp;quot;
Abstract
This session is focused on practical techniques for the verification and validation of autonomous systems from specification via design to the code level. Because no single technique is adequate to cover a whole system in practice, a variety of verification techniques, including formal methods, such as model checking and theorem proving, and state-of-the-art simulation-based methods, will be presented from first principles and brought into the context of robotics. How these techniques can be applied will be illustrated using real-world examples. We will start with the verification of control system designs with respect to high-level requirements, such as stability, using an assertion-based approach that combines simulation-based verification with automatic theorem proving. We will then focus on using model-based techniques to enhance test generation in the context of coverage-driven verification applied to code used in robots that directly interact with humans. The session will finish with the proposal to design autonomous systems &amp;quot;for verification&amp;quot;; this requires a paradigm shift towards more systematic design practices.

The research presented in this session is based on collaborations within the EPSRC funded projects &amp;quot;Robust Integrated Verification of Autonomous Systems&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Trustworthy Robotic Assistants&amp;quot;. This session will be supplemented with hands-on demonstrations presented by Dejanira Araiza Illan.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9df7de1f721.65580578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/RoboCalc-event/courses/practical-techniques-for-verification-and-validation-of-robots/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Agent Verification Workshop associated with TAROS 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31D21491-2229-42D4-9C6D-1E13A008841C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop on Agent Verification Techniques to which I contributed a session on &amp;quot;Theorem Proving and Testing for Autonomous Systems&amp;quot; and participated at a panel on &amp;quot;Current Research Challenges in Agent Verification&amp;quot; which sparked interesting questions.

The event highlighted recent advances and developments in verification in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), motivated by emerging applications involving autonomous systems such as automated vehicles and robotic systems. The talks focused on verification and control of complex CPS's, with the aim to facilitate an in depth understanding of the challenges posed by their hybrid dynamics, interconnected and distributed nature, the presence of exogenous and/or endogenous uncertainty affecting their evolution, their safety and operational critical nature, and with a wide coverage of possible solution methodologies. The goal of the workshop was to expose attendees to cutting edge research in the field, with an eye on both theory and applications, and to encourage the development of new results and the investigation of several important issues in the future of complex CPSs design, promoting novel collaborations. To this purpose, outstanding researchers from leading industries and universities worldwide were brought together by the organizers to offer their vistas on the field.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c809fb16e621.34341850</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cdc2016.ieeecss.org/workshops.php#w06</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8101</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Innovate UK Software Verification and Validation for Complex Systems</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Innovate UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>66584-471175</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BC902839-E09E-4794-88A0-38CC202EB640</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9dd3d75d8b7.87104628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>27150</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Industrial CASE Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>16000135 voucher code</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C5C5688C-F3FF-4A37-ABAC-690BD02E4390</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56da0ae82302d2.23464435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6511</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Innovate UK Software Verification and Validation for Complex Systems</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Innovate UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>65045-471140</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>31FD6D35-38DA-45F2-B2E6-2FE3AD067AC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9dcd5790728.46587731</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Two CASE studentships in collaboration with Infineon</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>20A65396-484A-419A-A705-97E9C3E4EF90</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7de1cb1ca32.51474521</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The simulation-based testing techniques developed by us in this project are being taken up by industry:

Two request have been made for my research team to collaborate in Innovate UK feasibility study projects to advise on the use of the model-based test generation techniques in practice. One of these is in collaboration with a tool provider, who intends to add this technique to the new tools they are developing. The other is in collaboration with an end user, who intends to gain more confidence in the correctness of their system using our techniques. Both projects were funded by Innovate UK and started in May 2016 with a duration of one year.

Since then, as part of the second Innovate UK Connected and Autonomous Vehicles call, I received two further invitations to become part of project consortia, covering verification and validation in these projects. Both proposals are being evaluated. We expect an announcement later in March 2017.

Work in this project has helped inform BSI Robot Safety and Robot Ethics standards.

Findings led to several new PhD student projects that will further illuminate issues of safety, reliability, trust, and trustworthiness for robots operating in human-inhabited environments.

New collaborations with industry through three CASE studentships have been initiated, all of these are expected to start in September/October 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2EC108A5-20DF-4CAD-9BD0-1154F66F89BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56da08f4dd82f7.74395392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Reliability and Safety. We conducted formal verification of an autonomous personal care robot, Care-o-bot, deployed within the University of Hertfordshire's Robot House test facility. We modelled the Care-o-bot's behaviour formally using Brahms, a high-level agent programming language. Using a software tool developed in-house, they were able to translate Brahms into Promela, the input language to the model checker Spin. Safety- and mission-critical requirements were translated into formal properties expressed in LTL and were then formally verified using Spin. This provided a higher level of confidence in the ability of Care-o-bot to take care of a person in the Robot House. In subsequent work an expanded set of properties was used to formalise a wider range of requirements, further increasing the confidence in Care-o-bot and further demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification for human-robot interaction scenarios.

We demonstrated the benefits of using coverage-driven verification to automate a large part of simulation-based testing of code used to control robots that directly interact with humans on the example of a human-robot collaborative manufacturing task. We then focused on the problem of efficiently generating effective tests. We developed a very effective model-based approach that made use of the high-level formal models and properties developed for formal verification and employed model checking in the test generation process. This approach is capable of directing test generation to hard to reach and critical interaction scenarios. By combining formal verification with simulation and test-based verification approaches we can benefit from their advantages and overcome their limitations, gaining a more comprehensive verification result overall. To further increase the level of automation, we then introduced agency into the verification environment by modeling the human and the environment the robot interacts with as agents. Our most recent results show that using multi-agent systems as models for test generation is as effective as the more traditional method of model checking automata, with the extra benefits of multi-agent models being small, in the number of lines of code when compared to the automata, and model traversal time being low and constant.

Ethics and Trust. We explored the viability of verifying formally whether an autonomous system is capable of behaving ethically. There are many different ethical systems across different societies, and it may be useful for definitions of ethical behaviour to change. A high-level agent programming language, Ethan, was devised to allow autonomous agents to be programmed with additional ethical requirements. Then, an existing agent interpreter and model checker were extended to allow for the formal verification of ethical behaviour. Human-robot interaction studies into trust and trustworthiness gave important insights into how people perceive robots performing different types of tasks with different levels of robot performance and communication abilities. 

Verifying Robotic Systems. We have also made progress towards the holistic framework for the V&amp;amp;V of autonomous robotic assistants, as depicted in the earlier diagram. As part of the programme of populating the holistic framework, we have carried out testing of algorithms in and formal verification of autonomy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Techniques for verification and validation of human-robot interaction are the subject of subsequent research proposals and are beginning to have an impact on the robotics industry and regulatory/standards context. End users and tool providers have expressed an interest in using the techniques we have developed for the verification of autonomous systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7F36806F-6C02-485F-B1E7-EE415AF10AF7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56da14ea20ebc6.64672629</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://robosafe.csc.liv.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>871FA543-B28D-46D6-9710-CC8458BD0B57</gtr:id><gtr:title>Believing in BERT: Using expressive communication to enhance trust and counteract operational error in physical Human-robot interaction</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/427c46963f98440c95907f355666aae7"><gtr:id>427c46963f98440c95907f355666aae7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamacher A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d9bfc06c63.92130023</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCA1AB5A-8C65-4E17-BAF4-7CEADC99E697</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards the safety of human-in-the-loop robotics: Challenges and opportunities for safety assurance of robotic co-workers'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/af898d4855ca42f1f7dafd8b8c621f31"><gtr:id>af898d4855ca42f1f7dafd8b8c621f31</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eder K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4799-6763-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54615106e75d09.58420058</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B588A4A-C635-42C3-9D99-01A6F583CB37</gtr:id><gtr:title>A fuzzy approach to qualification in design exploration for autonomous robots and systems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e3bd14ffb9b7ab991718399116fcf230"><gtr:id>e3bd14ffb9b7ab991718399116fcf230</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morse J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a3bbd5b18c269.50996983</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0BDA6095-216D-4B96-9E5F-C102AD8CB14A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can you trust your robotic assistant?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e23fe73af41e9258fec61cf35676ac1"><gtr:id>8e23fe73af41e9258fec61cf35676ac1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Amirabdollahian F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9d7ad97dae4.84750299</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K006320/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
