Imagine that the ball is a point that moves without friction, so that it keeps moving forever if it does not hit any pockets. This is a mathematical billiard. These idealized billiards are studied by mathematicians because they arise naturally as models of various systems in the physical sciences. Moreover, they represent one of simplest models of chaos. Billiard trajectories that never hit a pocket become quickly complicated and chaotic. One of the main goals in dynamical systems and ergodic theory is to describe and quantify this chaotic properties and to be able to predict thei asymptotic behaviour.One of the objectives of this research is to prove chaotic properties of a class of billiards in polygons. The goal of understanding billiards in polygons has led to the development of very deep mathematical theories, in particular to the study of an abstract space (the moduli space) of deformations of surfaces. The study of moduli spaces has independent interest and connections and applications to different areas of fundamental research in mathematics (as algebraic geometry and number theory) and in theoretical physics. The beautiful philosophy that has guided the research in the field is that properties of a single billiard are reflected by the properties of the dynamics in the moduli space. Unfortunately, some of the deep results obtained for these abstract spaces do not apply directly to billiards, which form a small set in this abstract space.In our proposal we plan to develop methods and tools to solve some of the open questions for polygonal billiards and other concrete systems which cannot currently be attacked by the standard tools. We have recently developed a renormalization technique which allows to attack these problems. We plan to get very precise information which is not usually accessible for generic systems. Other related objectives concern the properties of maps of the interval, called interval exchange transformations, which arise naturally in connection with billiards and have been studied as a basic model of dynamical system. We plan to investigate long-standing open problems about their spectral properties and a new generalization of classical Diophantine properties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We identify two main routes to impact, through cross-fertilization and public engagement. The first route aims at promoting, in the long-term scale, the potential impact to society, which is the ultimate beneficiary of the research in pure mathematics through technological and scientific applications. We plan activities to maximise the dissemination of the results, ideas and techniques developed in the proposed research to other areas of mathematics and sciences. Specifically, computer science and physics have connections with the proposed area of research. Thus, we propose in particular to write a survey targeted at the computer scientists community and to disseminate our results to conferences with a physicists audience. This cross-fertilization will facilitate the long-term benefits/applications to society. The second route to impact is through public engagement: exploiting the fact that some of the basic ideas behind the current research are very suitable to be advertised to a general audience, we plan a series of activities to to engage with the wider public. Such activities include talks aimed at the general public and to school students. Furthermore, students at untergraduate and postgraduate levels will benefit by learning ideas and techniques through the proposed dissemination through University based activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68010</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for the Mathematics Communication Website Maddmaths</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>330258B6-1255-4242-9E3F-62C4F350648A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was interviewed by an editor of the Italian website Maddmaths devoted to popularization of Mathematics to a general audience.

One of the major breakthrough results proved concerns the chaotic properties for a mathematical physics model, the Ehrenfest windtree model, introduced in 1912 by physicist Paul and Tatjana Ehrenfest. Almost no rigorous results were known about his properties until recently. In joint work with Fraczek we proved lack of ergodicity for typical parameters, a result which came quite unexpected to the scientific community working in this area. More in general, we proved a non-ergodicity criterium which applies to other infinite periodic billiards such as the tube with barriers. For the latter, we were also able to construct explicitely a rich set of exceptional ergodic directions. Another contribution to our understanding of ergodicity in infinite systems, also joint work with Fraczek, was to construct the very first known examples of ergodic extensions of area-preserving flows of higher genus. 



In joint work with Vincent Delecroix, we developed a new algorithm for studying translation surfaces. This algorithm (based on diagonal changes) has many advantages with respect to the currently used algorithms (such as Rauzy-Veech algorithm and train-track splittings). In particular it allows to produce a complete list of saddle connections which are geometric best approximations and enumerate all bispecial factors in the corresponding symbolic dynamics. Another potential application of this algorithm is to the set up of Lagrange spectra. In joint work with Hubert and Marchese we defined a generalization of the classical and well-studied Lagrange Spectrum to translation surfaces and proved some of its basic properties exploting renormalization techniques.

In particular, in joint work with Artigiani and Marchese, we focused on Lagrange spectra of particularly symmetric surfaces, known as Veech surfaces. We showed that high values in their spectra are particularly rich, i.e. contain a full ray of values, so called Hall ray, thus generalizing a famous old result for classical Lagrange spectra. On the other hand, in a recent prepublication in joint work with Hubert, Lelievre and Marchese we analysed in detail the spectrum of a surface which is a cover of the classical torus case and showed that its spectrum does display new and interesting phenomena, including a &amp;quot;route to chaos&amp;quot; kind of behaviour. 



Finally, in parallel to the research topics of the main grant proposal, we also investigated chaotic properties of other parabolic flows. While certain examples of parabolic flows such as the horocycle flows and Heisenberg flows are well understood, many open questions are open for the simplest perturbations of such systems, such as time-changes. In joint work with Forni we proved a conjecture by Katok and Thouvenot on the nature of the spectrum for time changes of the horocycle flow, while in joint work with Avila and Forni we showed that generic time-changes of Heisenberg nilflows are mixing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Via dissemination through other areas of
