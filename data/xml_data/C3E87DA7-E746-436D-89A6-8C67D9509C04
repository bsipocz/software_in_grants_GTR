Similarly, Steer et al. (Proceedings of the Nutrition Society 2008, Vol 67, E363) showed that bread products alone contributed 12% of the protein, 20% of the fibre and 16% of the iron to the adult UK diet, with white bread alone contributing 11% of the dietary fibre.
 
There is a clear and widely accepted need to increase the intake of dietary fibre in the UK diet, from the current 1.3g per day to the recommended intake of 18g per day. Doubling the content of DF in white bread could therefore contribute an additional 1.43g fibre to the daily intake.

The financial benefits of increasing dietary fibre to consumers are more difficult to quantify as they relate to quality of life and reduced health care costs. However, there are massive projected increases in disease for which the risk factors include low dietary fibre: clinical obesity in UK adults to 50% of the population by 2050, type 2 diabetes by 20-fold, hypertension by 5-fold, CVD by 2.5-fold and some cancers by 3-fold. These figure indicate that even small improvements in diet could have a significant impact on health, with associated reductions in health care costs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60047</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have produced mapping populations that are well suited to find genomic regions involved in grain fibre content.
