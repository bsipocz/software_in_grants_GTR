It does this by taking the view that utopias are as much of grassroots articulations of socially inclusive cities and citizenship as they are top-down visions of urban planning. Building upon the strong foundations established through existing partnerships between UK and Indian researchers, this project aims to explore how an alternate history of utopian urban planning can inform the trajectories of future cities and urbanization in India. It is led by urban geographer (Datta) from UK and architect and feminist geographer (Sabhlok) from India. This is supported by UK Co-Is - Indian historian (Gould) and Urban History and development scholar (Madgin). The aim of the network is to uncover parallel histories of the utopian city that have so far been changed, dominated or appropriated by top down visions of Indian urban planning. It will examine urban histories as being made up of a variety of interacting and sometimes competing utopian visions. These visions also define citizenship in differentiated rather than universal ways, strongly linked to context, material conditions and political activism. The network will analyse and share knowledge of these alternate histories through a series of inter-connected city workshops with local academics, urban planners and grassroots organisations in India and an end of project symposium in the UK.

The network aims to answer the following key questions:
- How are urban utopias historically and culturally conditioned in India? The aim here will be to map and analyse how utopian visions of a new kind of social and political order have particular associations with regimes of control and containment. This will examine how utopias envisioned in newly independent India (1950s) are connected to utopian visions of the 1960s or post liberalization India (2000s). We will identify common threads and divergences in city blueprints, the parameters of creating these cities and their current contribution to India's urban future. We will also explore how far urban utopian visions are conditioned by competitive aspirations and developed for external audiences. 
- How can the utopian city take account not just of the diversity of its citizens but also the diversity of their visions of the ideal city? This seeks to address the paradoxical nature of the utopian city - as a rule of order and as a productive space of transformation. In other words, we will seek to question how utopias are embodied and engendered by subaltern citizens to sustain as well as challenge political regulation. Drawing upon oral histories, diaries, photographs, letters and other forms of informal artefacts brought to the workshops, this will seek to unsettle the finality of the urban utopia to suggest the continuous mode of becoming of the utopian Indian city. 
- How can a history of the utopian city inform the future of India's urbanization? This aims to examine a dual utopian visioning whereby it is only possible to imagine a utopian future by learning from the history of urban utopias. In so doing, we approach India's urban futures as already written through its urban histories and therefore accessible to us only through an understanding of its histories. Moreover, as the future is yet to materialise, we argue that its trajectory can be shifted towards more inclusive outcomes through the inclusion of a history of subaltern utopias.

The further purpose of the meetings is to extend the project to a) other South Asian cities; b) explore the means by which academics working on urban society and culture can interact with planners, third sector organisations and architects; c) explore the possibilities for further projects examining the relationship between urban utopias in the Global South and global north.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The central thrust of this project is to examine the ways in which urban utopian visions have been conceived and implemented within Indian cities. This is of crucial importance to Indian cities today as 100 cities have recently been designated as Smart Cities along with the reconceptualisation of heritage cities announced in 2014. As such the project lies at the intersection of academia and policy and this is reflected in the ways in which the project has been designed. The network will be of practical relevance to four groups in India.

a) Government departments/agencies particularly the Minorities Commission, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and Niti Aayog (erstwhile Planning Commission); Stakeholders in this group often see marginalised citizens as potential recipients of policy rather than active and contributing citizens in shaping the future of their cities. The network will ensure the visibility of the contribution of marginalised citizens to parallel urban histories and grassroots utopias and enable a more nuanced and collaborative approach to including ordinary in India's future urbanization. The network will in particular provide information about the multiple ways that a city can be remembered, experienced and imagined and thus raise consciousness of the presence of alternate utopias among this group of stakeholders. It is expected that their interaction with other stakeholders in the workshops will enable representatives from government to become more receptive to citizen participation in shaping India's future cities.

b) Arts and heritage organisations: Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Sangeet Natak Academy (Chandigarh), Budhan Theatre (Ahmedabad). The network will provide information on the disconnect between the utopian blueprint and the intangible heritage vested in urban life at street level; on the relative successes of citizen transformations of the built environment into grassroots utopias; and on how a sensitivity to social differences can sustain or disrupt the utopian city. In particular it will provide an understanding of the meaning and nature of 'heritage' vested in citizenship practices and how these can be incorporated into the heritage of future cities.

c) Built environment professionals such as architects and planners will find the network of relevance since it will provide an arena via the workshops to discuss the design and planning of future cities with potential 'clients' - that is those who might actually inhabit these cities. This is significant in professional practice where architects and planner often have to second guess the requirements of the users and hence produce blueprints that aim to solidify a particular set of universal social relations. Interacting with citizens in the workshops will allow professionals to challenge their own 'expert' knowledge and accommodate a diversity of approaches in future urban planning. this form of knowldge exchange in the long run can displace neoliberal regimes of urbanizaion with more socially just production of grassroots utopian cities.

d) Third Sector organisations: Abhivyakti (Nashik); Chhoti si aasha (Chandigarh), Saksham Trust (Chandigarh), Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolann (BMMA) Mumbai; the network will provide a space for collaboration and knowledge exchange relevant to policy advocacy and citizen participation. It will allow stakeholders in this group to reflect upon teh learning process that shapes active and productive citizenships that can then feed into the making of more inclusive cities of the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Between 12 June and 5 July 2016, our project resulted in a photography exhibition around the cities of Mumbai and Varanasi - two of the key cities explored in the project.

This workshop was held from 27-28 May 2016 and was locally organised by Dr Ratoola Kundu, from the School of Habitat Studies in Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai. Through the two days of workshop, we brought together a range of scholars, urban activists, practitioners, citizens, elected representatives, bureaucrats and others to debate and discuss the urbanisation trajectories (past, present and future) of Navi Mumbai. In particular we drew from narratives, reports, experiences, projects and proposals - incorporating both top-down and bottom-up, formal and informal, documented and undocumented realms of urban imaginations for a 'city built from scratch' at a significant moment of India's liberalisation in the 1990s. 

The two days of workshops were organised under several themes - histories of urbanisation, the land question, governance, housing and infrastructure and grassroots voices. On the first day, after the opening of the workshop and introduction to the key themes of the project from Ayona Datta, Anu Sabhlok and Ratoola Kundu, the first session explored the histories of Navi Mumbai's urban trajectory.

The partners, Tata Institute of Social Sciences organised the city workshop in Mumbai bringing together a range of stakeholders from grassroots, government, policy making, business and academia.

The Utopian Cities project was introduced by Drs Ayona Datta and Anu Sabhlok by firstly explaining the overall rationale for the project as a whole and secondly by looking at what would come up for the second workshop in Chandigarh. Utopian Cities involves the setting up of four city workshops in locations that have been identified as 'Smart Cities' but which cover a range of possible urban futures, from those focussing on infrastructural development to heritage cities - Chandigarh and Navi Mumbai representing the first group and Varanasi and Nashik the second. The format of the meetings closely follows the overall rationale of the project in examining the relationship between 'top down' visions of the city, compared to 'grassroots' utopian visions. However, the meetings are also an opportunity for us to explore new ideas about urban utopias as they emerge in each specific place. William Gould also explained the roots of the project, how the collaboration came about and the relationship between the AHRC and the ICHR.

The final discussions picked up on different presentations and posed the following questions: a) how do we combine the need to maintain and sustain the tangible and intangible heritage of the city with the requirements that rapid urbanisation raise?; b) what kinds of leverage can the city's poor exercise in relation to local government and planning policy? What support can they expect and from what kinds of organisations? c) To what extent are the problems created by rapid urbanisation experienced in different ways by different groups in the city?</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided overall intellectual direction and advice on smart cities.

The workshop was organised by our partner, a local NGO - Moolbhoot Hakka Andolan (MHA) with the support of Shilpa Dahake (PhD student in IISER, Mohali). The workshop was organised under several themes relevant to Nashik - Smart city, housing and urban space, water and waste management, cultural heritage and education and health issue. These were organised over a day and half of intense workshops that included locally elected representatives, municipal officials, planners, architects, business, journalists, and several representatives of grassroots organisations.

The one and half days of workshop were stimulating lively and animated at several times. The key issues that emerged from the workshop was that there is a high disjuncture between the aims of the smart city proposals and the actually existing needs and demands from Nashik's urban citizens, particularly those historically, culturally and legally disenfranchised. We discussed ways in which the smart city rhetoric could be used to forward these claims from the grassroots or whether there was a need for an alternative rhetoric and practice that would articulate citizens' needs more appropriately. We concluded that Nashik is unique in the strong presence and activism of civil society groups which produced spaces and visions of hope for a progressive urban future.

The partners brought together a range of participants from grassroots, academia, government, business and third sector to debate and discuss the transformation of Nashik into a smart heritage city.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided overall intellectual direction and advice on smart cities.

It was planned to foster conversation between academics, bureaucrats, NGOs and activists on the contested histories and imagined futures for Chandigarh. In that sense, the discussion revealed the connections between the past, present and futures - the spatial and temporal linkages showed how the plan for Chandigarh as a smart city reimagined, challenged and/or reproduced the ideas of Chandigarh as 'City Beautiful' and 'Heritage City.' The workshop brought to the fore cracks that lie between the planners' vision and the experiences of cities' diverse populations.

The conference was held at the Headingly Arts and Enterprise Centre (HEART) and was well attended by academics from a number of different countries including the UK, America and India. Over the two days, four themes: Histories of the Future City, Imaginations, Possibilities, and Comparative Utopias guided the discussion. The four panels comprised of two plenary speakers per session plus 3-4 shorter, 15 minute papers and the conference was concluded with a roundtable by the academic organisers, Ayona Datta, Will Gould, Rebecca Madgin and Anu Sabhlok.

The conference brought to light a number of issues related to utopian urban futures, including the role of history, and the construction of power but over the course of the conference it became apparent that there needs to be much more of a focus on the role of the citizen within their local context. A number of speakers had considered this issue throughout the Leeds conference but we left asking the question whether those durable elements of the local environment identified by local citizens who are embedded in the everyday routines of cities are actually the real versions of utopian cities. If so the challenge appears to be narrowing the gap between this everyday experience and the imagined desires of urban professionals and national governments.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91d310c7578.17816105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://utopiancities.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/utopian-urban-futures-conference-report/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>April 2016 - three paper presentations in Association of American Geographers annual meeting, San Francisco, USA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DE209B9-3ADC-4259-B11C-DB6E1353A108</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Datta (PI) presented three papers in three different sessions at the AAG annual meeting.

Datta was invited as a speaker in the UNCTAD CSTD 19 annual meeting in Geneva, where she delivered findings from the project to an audience comprised largely of high-level country representatives and policy makers in the UN. Datta's work was cited in the UN World Cities Report in 2016 as well as highlighted as an agenda contributor to the World Economic Forum. Datta's work has also been used and informally circulated in the IT industry, leading to an invitation to deliver a keynote in the (1400 strong) employee away day of an IT company named Thoughtworks in Hyderabad, India.

Gould's work on corruption and anti-corruption movements in urban contexts has led to his being invited on an expert's panel at the Cabinet Office, UK, advising on anti-corruption in the Commonwealth (19 August 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B6175A90-E6A3-41A4-A139-122187F24C86</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b87bbb971b42.18989137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an approach to understanding urban futures through a consideration of the past. Taking the hypothesis that 'future is a cultural fact' (Appadurai 2015) we have examined the histories, imaginations and possibilities of alternative urban utopias ina neoliberal urban age. As the outcome of an AHRC-ICHR jointly funded network titled 'Learning from the Utopian City: Alternative histories of India's urban futures', we have explored how subaltern histories of utopian urban planning can inform the trajectories of future cities and rapid urbanization in the global south and north.

We have connected this approach specifically to visions, policies and practices around the idea of the Smart City in India, and have found a number of important connections, in ideas of utopian urban planning, between our main cities of analysis. There are some common patterns, for example, in the forms of subaltern expression and organization in response to urban planning overall. Many of these responses draw upon historical ideas about the importance of particular spaces in the city, land ownership or control and the relationship between citizens' movement and urban governance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Can be taken forward in shifting academic debates and policy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>11FD5DD4-10A6-485E-B3AC-C82BA056CFD5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c92010a98460.61514344</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://utopiancities.wordpress.com/blog-posts/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in the UN World Cities Report 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A2C38CA-A156-4A09-BC78-686B2DD0FC17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Highlighted that the article had contributed to our understanding often role of rapid urbanisation on growing income and wealth inequality</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c87c10459778.23996369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://wcr.unhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2016/05/WCR-%20Full-Report-2016.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Agenda contributor World Economic Forum</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5660A67B-3149-4D31-BA12-37EA8AB1F3A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article written in the ConversationUK was cited in the World Economic Forum which was part of several citations to improve and direct policymaking for smart cities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8816f2307c1.52490568</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/ayona-datta</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to Cabinet Office Round Table on Corruption in Global South</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D75BE50B-CC81-4C3E-89FF-0DEFAA2EC68C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c918bab71697.10480811</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFF69C12-CC2E-404C-92A5-0812BE45D042</gtr:id><gtr:title>The New Urban Agenda: key opportunities and challenges for policy and practice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Urban Research &amp;
