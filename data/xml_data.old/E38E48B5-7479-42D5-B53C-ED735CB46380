Several interweaving strands traverse the study, in particular the relations between body and soul, love and death, desire and passion. From the first discussions of the passions by the Greek philosophers, in particular Aristotle, passion has held a borderline position. Manifested in both body and soul (weeping and anguish of heart in sadness, sexual desire and emotional yearning in romantic love, for example), passion has proved persistently difficult to categorize. It is not possible to work on passion without exploring the mind/body relationship; and the question of death, of human mortality, is the place where this relationship is most intensely explored. What happens to the subject in death? What does human embodiment mean for the subject at the point of death? And the focus on death necessarily brings love into the frame, for the relationship between love, passion and death is intrinsic to human experience. Friendship and love are always already permeated by anticipated loss. All experience is predicated on its ultimate transience, in other words on its death. It is the inevitable death of the other that gives our relationship with him or her its poignancy and intensity.\n Ancient and modern philosophers have, of course, examined these ideas many times before, and I shall draw on them for the insights they offer into contemporary debates and to gauge the ways in which modern thinkers are dependent on and depart from their precursors. At one pole of my study will be an exploration of texts such as Plato's Symposium and Aristotle's De Anima, at the other pole will be an attempt to take into account the claims of radical materialism as they are expressed for example in the advances of contemporary neuroscience, as well as the contributions of Anglo-American Philosophy of Mind and the Analytic philosophical tradition. This is, I am aware, a vast area of study, but one of the main aims of my research is precisely to construct a synthetic rather than a sectarian approach. \n How then are passion and death understood by recent theorists and scientists? It is easy to see how philosophies inspired by contemporary neuro-science may relegate love to being a mere by-product of chemical changes in the brain caused by neuro-transmitters carrying endorphins, serotonin, oxytocin and dopamine which have been observed to accompany and perhaps even cause the experience commonly referred to as 'falling in love'. Similarly, death may seem unproblematic if mind, spirit and soul are envisaged as mere effects of activity in the brain. Radical materialism certainly risks de-dramatising all experiences of passion and mortality. Nevertheless, a desire for a more humane understanding of such fundamental experiences as love and death is often manifest in even the most apparently reductionist thinkers. This is evident, for example, in recent collaborative work between biologists, neuroscientists, psychoanalysts and philosophers whose joint ventures attempt to understand the nature of mind, emotion and consciousness in ways which do not reduce the spiritual to an illusory reflection of the neurological.\n It is against this broad background that my study of mortality, subjectivity and passion in recent French philosophy will be conducted. The issues examined are clearly of interest to specialists and general public alike. I believe that the resolutely interdisciplinary approach of this project will make a real contribution to our understanding of French thought of the second half of the twentieth century as it attempts to grapple with some of the most fundamental and perennial of philosophical questions.\n \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28103</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Considerable interest in the implications of my work both for the understanding of human subjectivity and indeed of dying, death and mourning.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9506D567-4CC5-4600-BF86-50815C2AC79A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54365cf91d96e5.63050232</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This monograph tackles an area - the relationship between subjectivity and mortality - in a way that has not previously been attempted. It explores the work of twelve major twentieth-century French philosophers as they discuss subjectivity, and shows how the question of mortality underlies all their analyses. It concludes by using the possible-impossible aporia to draw together the different philosophical approaches, that is to say it comes to the paradoxical conclusion that mortality is both the condition of possibility and of impossibility of mortality.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Reviews of my monograph have been extremely positive, including a recommendation by Jean-Luc Nancy, one of the key philosophers whose work I studied. I have been invited to take my work further in the context of a project on Emergence at the University of Durham, and I will visit the University next May to present my findings and participate in their research programme. My topic will be 'The emergence of the soul/subject'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F5E4C4AA-188C-40CA-BEEB-24B595AF4975</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54365c705a2714.60471583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E8983A8-2B10-4AC3-9CFD-FFFF6FF3C982</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mortal Subjects</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98611e04900a9ed6cf1738afc799082b"><gtr:id>98611e04900a9ed6cf1738afc799082b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howells, Christina</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-7456-5274-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_28765411683c0370b4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H003746/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
