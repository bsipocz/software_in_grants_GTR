It seeks to achieve meaningful policy debate, practical action for research informed improvement to strategy and services, and a synergy that could help to underpin future research. &lt;br />&lt;br />Jointly managed by the University of Sheffield Department of Town and Regional Planning and HQN Ltd, and supported by the Housing Studies Association, the one-year project will create a bespoke network within HQN?s current membership of about 700 housing organisations. There will be three main outputs: a monthly newsletter featuring news and digests of relevant academic and other research, aimed at practitioners, an impact-focused initiative working individually with four organisations to support them in incorporating academic research into their policy and practice or strategic work, and a final event to promote collaboration.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project is led by principal investigator Dr Ed Ferrari with support from Professor John Flint. Researcher Dr Janis Bright will be placed with HQN Ltd to develop the project.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Primary beneficiaries would be: social housing organisations, tenants and residents, national and local policy makers across the UK, and HQN Ltd. Academics will also benefit.

Social housing organisations would benefit from being able to access a far wider range of academic research than currently, in a format that is helpful to them. Publications from the project would also enable more timely access to data and findings, allowing research to be used in practice more quickly. Organisations would benefit from better decision-making, based on or taking account of research evidence. Four organisations would benefit directly from individual work with the project team.

Tenants and residents would benefit indirectly from improvements in services, and possibly better value, made as a consequence of research evidence. It should also be noted that some tenants and residents are themselves involved in the running of social housing organisations, and could benefit from direct access to research.

Policy makers also require robust research evidence on which to formulate their policies and strategies, but particularly at local level their access to such information may be limited - especially in times of stretched resources. The project would enable policy makers to access a wider range of research findings, potentially enhancing their ability to encompass broader themes in their work.

All types of end users would benefit from greater capacity to get involved in the design of future ESRC and other funded research projects.

HQN Ltd would benefit in being able to offer an enhanced and innovative service to members at no extra cost. The new product would form an important part of its portfolio. In the longer term the company could gain a competitive advantage, by offering what would currently be the only such service in the housing field.

In summary, the impacts and beneficiaries are: 
1 Long term: improving impacts of housing-related investments and policy. A broader set of users - who will make real investments in housing, neighbourhoods and communities; and who will make policy in these areas - will have faster and easier access to cutting edge housing research. Primary beneficiaries: social housing organisations, tenants and residents, national and local policy makers across the UK.

2 Medium term: improving the capacity of research users to get engaged in the design of future ESRC (and other) funded academic projects. Primary beneficiaries: social housing organisations, tenants and residents, academics.

3 Short term: helping HQN develop a commercially viable means of synthesising and disseminating academic research among its members. Primary beneficiaries: social housing organisations, tenants and residents, HQN Ltd.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Housing Studies Association</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Housing Studies Association</gtr:description><gtr:id>37828958-0D25-4140-9B28-32279E5A48E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d97a1ab9d97a38-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This project involved the development of a unique three way collaboration between an academic research organisation (Department of Town and Regional Planning at the University of Sheffield), a private sector partner (HQN Ltd) and a learned society (Housing Studies Association).

The project utilised the HQN's subscription based membership network of senior executives, board members, involved residents, and others associated with the policy and delivery of housing in the UK. The project findings and outputs (principally the series of edited 'Evidence' newsletters) were distributed free of charge and without paywall or registration. Publicity was via the abovementioned email to approximately 2,300 recipients as well as social media (tweets, retweets, etc.).

HQN Ltd have used the project's findings and outputs to continue the Evidence project without need for ESRC funding. This is helping them to develop a commercial proposition out of the project as well as continue to provide accessible syntheses of research findings from academic projects to the policy and practice community. Tacit evidence of the reach of the project can be found through discussion and dialogue with policymakers and practitioners. Significantly, the PI was able to use three meetings of an ESRC Seminar Series (Housing and the Big Society, PI: Kim McKee) to further publicise and current project and assess its impact and reach. Discussions with senior policymakers in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland suggested a high level of engagement with both the project's specific outputs (newsletters) and the general findings of a need for more accessible research syntheses which answer the 'so what?' question.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CF4ECFA0-7A07-488B-91C1-D1FDCFD2BAB5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54fef3c2e70930.80419827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005669/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
