Latin had been the language of the Medieval Church and the preserve of scholars and the clergy, and the Latin Bible, known as the Vulgate, was regarded as the standard. Erasmus of Rotterdam created a storm of controversy with his unmasking of the inaccuracies of the Vulgate. Catholic scholars, following Erasmus, undertook revisions of the Vulgate according to the principles of humanist linguistic and text criticism. 

Protestants, however, did something rather extraordinary. Instead of revising the Vulgate, or even abandoning it, they undertook new translations of the Old and New Testaments from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. During the sixteenth century five complete translations of the Bible, as well as individual books and Testaments, into Latin were undertaken by Lutheran and Reformed scholars. Why? This is the principal research question of this project. 


These massive Latin Bibles produced by Protestant scholars have received virtually no attention from scholars. This project will remind us that Latin remained the language of the Protestant reformers and that we need to understand more fully the place of Latin in the Reformation. The need for Latin Bibles reflected various dimensions of the new Reformation movement: an accurate Latin Bible was thought to be the necessary basis for translations into the vernacular languages as few among the clergy (their primary readership) were capable of using either Hebrew or Greek; the Latin Bible was also viewed as a means of promoting and propagating particular religious ideas in foreign lands as Latin remained the interactional language of Protestantism; there was also a degree of confessional rivalry as the Protestant churches sought to demonstrate that their scholarship and learning was superior not only to the Catholics, but also to that of other Protestants. Latin Bibles were regarded as symbols of intellectual sophistication and the source of considerable pride to those cities capable of producing them. Thus, they were simultaneously tools of learning, cultural ornaments, and pieces of religious propaganda. 

This project will set these Bibles in their historical, religious, and linguistic contexts through comparative examinations of the texts, a study of the networks of scholars involved, and an investigation of the purposes for which these Bibles were intended.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232630</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key finding of the project was that through careful examination of Protestant Latin Bibles in their historical, theological, and linguistic contexts we have demonstrated the diverse ways in which central sacred text of the Reformation was produced, interpreted, and read. 
1) We examined the multiple attitudes taken towards translation of the Bible in the Renaissance period and demonstrated how these debates mapped onto the controversies of the Reformation. This was largely achieved through careful reading of the extensive prefatory and paratextual material in the context of contemporary developments. We worked to put the Bibles in their historical contexts by examining how the arguments in the texts related to current debates and the development of Reformation thought and praxis. One example is the intersection of Bible and liturgy. 
2) We have made a significant contribution to understanding the ways in which linguistic competence and knowledge developed during the sixteenth century. This was achieved through careful philological analysis of the Bibles. For the final book we have an extensive section in which we compare translations line by line to demonstrate degrees of syntactical, vocabulary, and theoretical borrowing and difference. This work alerted us to the ways in which the Bibles were both singular as well as part of a larger Protestant project. 
3) Our project explored carefully the ways in which the Bibles were produced and the texts (with extensive paratext) were carefully printed to frame the reading of the material. Again, this work was done in conjunction with scholars of book history to explain how the strategies for page layout were integral to the ways in which the text was to be read and interpreted. Attention to these strategies often revealed the pedagogical purposes of the Bibles. 
4) We have expanded our understanding of scholarly networks in the Reformation, exploring how knowledge was shared, appropriated, and revised. Correspondence and records of personal contact proved invaluable for understanding the collaborative ways in which the translators of the Bible worked. These extensive nature of these networks, as well as the hostilities that occasionally arose between scholars, opened up for us the complex worlds in which the Bible translations were produced.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The final product of the project (the book written by Dr McLean and myself, which will go to press in the Autumn), will make a major contribution to the study of the Bible in the early modern period. As we were the first to examine these Bibles in detail and in a comparative context, we have created a fresh body of knowledge that can be used by scholars and non-scholars in a variety of ways. For scholars, the work pushes in new directions the study of text, language, and reading. For non-scholars (and these findings have been disseminated through public lectures), our project provides new ways of thinking about what sort of book the Bible was in the Reformation, and, thereby, how it can be thought of today in our pluralistic society. An example of this outreach is a recent invitation to consult for the new Museum of the Bible in Washington.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABD597F7-6ACA-4306-9AA1-B3E2FAAE7615</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0524ea36b84.44942951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CEA4C208-059D-46BF-BCBB-0F5D8B7B430B</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Remembering Jerome and Forgetting Zwingli.
