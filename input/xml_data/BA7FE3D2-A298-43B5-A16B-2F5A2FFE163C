DPFS Devolved Portfolios are block awards for specific universities to support goal-orientated translational research projects. The award allows universities to allocate the money to different translational projects more responsively based on their relative progress. For example the university might decide to stop a particular project and recycle the money allocated to it into other proposals.

A number of pharmaceutical companies have programmes to develop biological agents (e.g. antibodies) that inhibit NgR1 function (Biogen, Novartis and GSK). We have used virtual screening to identify the first small drug-like NgR1 inhibitors; however, for reasons discussed in section 4.2 below we would like to identify additional hits to advance this programme. To this end we have used similar in silico techniques to identify ~100 compounds that are closely related to the existing hits, as well as ~100 novel candidates all from the ChemBridge library of 800,000 compounds. The aim of this project is to obtain evidence that our &amp;quot;in-house&amp;quot; approach can identify novel selective NgR1 antagonists, and to use this as the starting point for seeking funding for a major drug discovery programme.

It is characterised by multiple benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours (neurofibromas). Affected individuals have a 7%-13% life-time risk of developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs) that ususally arise from benign plexiform neurofibromas. MPNST are challenging to diagnose and treat, frequently heralding a poor prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows the site and extent of the tumour but is not a reliable indicator of malignancy. [18]-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission computerised tomography (FDG PET-CT) has enabled the selection of patients likely to have MPNST by virtue of the increased metabolic activity of the tumours, but demonstrates an overlap between benign and malignant tumours, necessitating potentially hazardous diagnostic surgery. Sensitive and specific diagnostic imaging is essential to predict MPNST grade and prognosis and to permit monitoring of response to drug therapy. [11]C- methionine PET (MET PET) will be evaluated as a diagnostic tool for NF1-MPNSTs to determine its' superiority to FDG PET. MET and FDG PET findings will be compared with tumour histology (microscopic structure) to determine its ability to predict tumour grade and prognosis.

We have demonstrated that heterozygous nonsense mutation in the type II receptor (BMPR-II) for bone morphogenetic proteins, underlie the majority of the inherited and familial forms of PAH (2). The principle aim of this project is to develop a therapy for PAH by promoting translation readthrough of pathogenic nonsense alleles using non-toxic chemical agents. Current systems are not suitable for high-throughput screening, thus we have developed a dual-fluorescence reporter assay. We now seek to enhance the development of this assay and use it to identify small molecules capable of resolving BMPR2 mediated signalling defects. Studies performed in mammalian cells and a mouse model will provide proof of principle for restoration of receptor mediated signalling by demonstrating therapeutic effecacy prior to and following the onset of PAH

Recent studies have shown that lowering blood pressure does not normalise aortic stiffness. However, there is no clinical tool currently available to specifically assess the aortic stiffness, independent of blood pressure, for an individual patient. Solution: We will design and clinically validate a novel tool for clinical use to measure aortic stiffness through an innovative application of magnetic resonance imaging technology. Rationale: To identify high-risk individuals and tailor drug treatment aiming specifically at reducing large artery stiffness and hence mortality/morbity. Development plan: Implementation and validation of realtime MR flow techniques, providing an integrated PC-unit to display changing pulse wave velocity versus physiological parameters in real time and clinical study in hypertensive patients. s

Clostridium difficile (CD) is a major cause of hospital/healthcare outbreaks of diarrhoea, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CD causes disease by production of toxins A and B (encoded by genes tcdA, tcdB). Recent outbreaks have been due to virulent strains, most commonly ribotype 027, which produces an additional binary toxin (encoded by cdtA, cdtB) and hyperproduces toxin because of variation in the repressor gene tcdC. Rapid diagnosis is essential for patient management and infection control. Diagnosis is usually by Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) of toxins A and B, but performance of present kits is unsatisfactory. Detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is more specific but does not distinguish toxigenic from non-toxigenic strains. One commercial PCR system for detection of genes for B and binary toxins and one genetic variation in tcdC has been announced performance data are limited. There is a need for a rapid test to simultaneously detect genes for toxins A/B and binary, toxin hyperproduction and CD type. We propose to develop such a test using the Smiths Bioseeq automated LATE-PCR system, which allows complex multiplexing and can be run safely by non-specialised staff in non-laboratory settings.

The reliable assessment of these biomarkers in biological samples, particularly those from the clinic, has proved challenging; immunohistochemistry in this context has been poorly controlled, minimally quantified and lacking in the specificity required. Prior work has established that an optical, coincidence detection approach can drive specificity to yield spatially resolved, robust and meaningful patient data. We have now translated the principle of coincidence detection into a novel coincidence biodetector that has been tested successfully as a coincidence readout. Through the generation of a small repertoire of recombinant detectors fused to this novel coincidence readout, we now propose to establish the proof of concept for this biomarker approach

Computerised CRT reduces therapist burden but existing packages have not been designed for schizophrenia. CIRCuiTS is a new, ecologically-valid, graphically and functionally sophisticated computerised CRT programme, driven by clear theoretical principles and relies on well-researched training techniques for schizophrenia. The software is complete, but its feasibility and acceptability, particularly in relation to its method of delivery and dose of treatment have not been assessed. This study will investigate: (a) the acceptability and feasibility of CIRCuiTS for a wide range of cognitive and computer abilities; (b) the extent to which patients need therapist assistance; (c) any therapist interface difficulties that might arise (d) the levels of within-therapy change that impact on outcome cognitive change to provide therapists with a within-therapy goal for task change. Feedback from this study will result in a refined therapeutic manual so that the programme will be ready to be tested in clinical trials.

Zebrafish is an ideal vertebrate model system for target validation and inhibitor screening where the aetiology and pathogenesis of cancer in zebrafish mirrors that in mammals. We wish to demonstrate that our zebrafish melanoma model can be used for target validation and as a drug-discovery tool using PAK4 as a proof of principle. Our model is published and validated as representative of human disease and has an advantage over previous zebrafish models because aberrant melanocyte proliferation occurs at an early larval stages which makes it amenable to high through put analysis. Tumour growth can be monitored by quantification of melanin expression and the fluorescently labelled tumour cells can be imaged in real time. We are seeking funds to strengthen our DPFS full proposal by 1. Generating a V12Ras vector with a commercially acceptable Green flourescent protein (GFP). We can then use this vector to establish a new zebrafish line at KCL as soon as we have full funding - this will significantly advance the project 2. Develop quantitative high-through-put analysis protocols for tumour growth and invasive behaviour - this will strengthen the unique aspects of the project proposal. 3. Identify siRNA sequences to knockdown zebrafish PAK4 - this will progress the proof of concept element of our proposal.

The clinical target is antibody-mediated acute rejection (AMR). This can arise because potential recipients of grafts have pre-existing antibodies against blood group (ABO) or human leukocyte antigens in the donated organ. At least 15% of potential recipients are denied transplantation for this reason and some manifestation of AMR is estimated to occur in 10-15% of renal transplants. AMR involves activation of the classical pathway of the complement system but this system interacts with coagulation pathways so that complement activation and thrombotic consequences go hand in hand. Thrombosis treated with anticoagulants given systemically is associated with a bleeding risk which is generally unacceptable in transplant surgery. Building on a chemical strategy which has been applied successfully to modified complement regulatory molecules, we have prepared novel inhibitors of thrombin which can be anchored to the vascular surface in organs by perfusion prior to transplantation. This permits the graft rather than the recipient patient to be anticoagulated. We have used an animal model of AMR in which sensitised rats rapidly reject transplanted kidneys. Preliminary results with a locally perfused lead compound have suggested that graft survival can be prolonged under conditions that avoid a major risk of bleeding. We are seeking support to validate this conclusion and to investigate if combination with complement inhibitors provides added benefit.
