The programme aimed to create sustainable mechanisms of knowledge exchange between a range of agencies involved in service delivery for new migrant groups and used the findings from previous ESRC-funded research on Eastern European children's experiences of migration in Scotland.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The programme promoted the inclusion of migrant families and better service delivery for new migrant groups through a series of events which offereddiverse opportunities for research-informed policy and practice and user engagement. It brought together policy makers, service managers, practitioners and migrant families in activities such as research-based seminars, workshops for practitioners, presentations at conferences and for specialist organisations (including local and national government), a national conference and events for the general public. In total, over 500 practitioners and policy makers and thousands of children and parents took part in events. As part of the project, an ?Information pack? for service providers was distributed to all local authorities in Scotland and a ?Guide for migrant parents on education and other services? as well as a children?s and young people?s booklet on migrant children?s experiences were produced for the general public. Finally, an interactive exhibition entitled ?At home abroad: Children?s exhibition on migration? was organised at the School Museum in Glasgow, with materials produced by children.&lt;/p>

In summary, through the proposed activities, a range of audiences will benefit from participation in events and opportunities to share good practice in supporting migrant groups and developing service delivery and policy targeted at inclusion of migrants, including:

- Practitioners all over Scotland working with migrant and non-migrant bilingual children and families will have the opportunity to participate in locally organised workshops, which will combine delivery of research-informed findings on migrant families' needs with opportunities for sharing of good practice; 
- Policy makers and service providers from all over Scotland and further afield will be invited to contribute and attend the programme seminars and become familiar with the project findings, identifying opportunities to implement findings from the research into policy and practice; also, the events will provide further opportunities for cross-sharing of ideas between services and policy-making organisations at local and national level; 
- Migrant children and young people will benefit from the distribution of a child-friendly multilingual guide to Scotland's schools and services entitled 'A young people's to Scotland's schools and services', which will include information for children on how the education system works and its requirements, as well as information on other services accessible to children (libraries, leisure, museums, medical services etc.) They will also benefit from being represented in the research findings disseminated and from their children's participation with images of their migration (art forms, posters, photos, videos) to the final exhibition; 
- Non-migrant Scottish children will benefit from a better understanding of migrant children's stories and issues of diversity and equality in a democratic society; 
- Academics will be directly involved in some of the project activities and will also be informed about the processes of knowledge exchange involved through the dissemination of findings at two external conferences and through emerging publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>At home abroad: Experiences of migration and intercultural activities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAF0214C-91EC-4705-93E4-8643F62956F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Event at the annual conference of Scottish Association for teachers of English as an additionsl language (SATEAL)

Although we cannot report measureable economic impacts, by continuing to 
disseminate the research and materials available for practitioners and policy makers, the project 
has led to an overall better understanding of the needs of the migrant families and improved 
service delivery and multi-agency collaboration. We also hope that by informing policy makers 
and service managers on migrant families' needs, the project has contributed to increased 
evidence-based practice and more inclusive policies nationally and regionally. 

Societal impacts 
 
The main societal impacts we have facilitated are in terms of practitioners', service 
managers' and policy makers' better understanding of the needs of migrant children and their 
families and reflection on their practice. A range of organisations and audiences from almost all 
local authorities in Scotland have benefited from engagement in the programme activities. We 
have also continued to raise awareness of the needs of migrant children through the media and 
events for the general public, to contribute to the ongoing debates on national identity and 
multiculturalism.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1BF2D7A6-D71B-404A-8B42-193B27EB0F7E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5465f497ed0e90.21279484</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a knowledge exchange programme, and as such, we did not set to produce any empirical findings. However, based on our experience of organising the events and the feedback from the participants, we have drawn a series of conclusions in relation to the processes of knowledge exchange and knowledge transfer:



? All service providers and policy makers who participated in the events valued the opportunity to engage in KE activities and were very enthusiastic about taking part, but almost all encountered difficulties in sustaining participation in the project;

? When working with schools, we found that practitioners had to find time in their schedule to engage in project-related activities and often priorities in the day job meant that they had little time for additional commitments;

? Children's involvement in activities is heavily dependent on adults' decisions (at school level - through managers and teachers, at home- through parents) and when organising events for children, researchers need to negotiate children's participation at several levels (head teacher, teacher, parent) and take into account families' access to transport, availability and willingness to take children to events;

? Barriers to practitioners' participation included heavy workloads, restructuring and changes in individual roles, multiple job demands, limited decision making power in some roles; support from senior managers was key for practitioners to participate;

? Practitioners wanted information presented in an easily accessible format and events that would have an immediate benefit for their day job. Parents involved also had high hopes from the project, directly related to improvements wanted in service;

? Feedback from the events for practitioners, managers and policy makers has been consistently high, with participants valuing opportunities to share practice and ideas. The vast majority considered attendance as 'time well-spent' and very valuable for their job in the feedback collected;

? Work-based, work-related, practitioner and parent-driven projects are more successful and manageable than externally driven initiatives; 

? There is still a considerable barrier in the involvement of ethnic minority parents with education and other services- parents, especially those newly arrived in a country, need clearer information on services available, entitlements and the expectations and 'rules of engagement' with public services.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Organisations involved in working with migrant children and their families could make use of the research findings summarised in the 'Research report' and the guidance developed in the 'Toolkit for service providers'. Links to other relevant resources are also available through the project website, under 'Resources'.



Service providers and parents could find the 'Guide for migrant parents...' useful, as it provides information on services available and entitlements (although more directly relevant to Scotland).



The poster for young people could be used by teachers, community educators and young people when discussing migration and its implications for children, young people and families. Also, the photographs from the exhibition, available online, can provide useful teaching and learning material:

? A 'Toolkit for service providers working with migrant children and their families'

? A 'Guide for migrant parents on services in Scotland' 

? A young people's poster/report entitled 'At home abroad: The life experiences of Eastern European migrant children in Scotland'



These have been included in an 'Information Pack' for service providers and policy makers, with all the materials available electronically through the project website.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D66389F-9466-4788-8322-EB61D7AFADBF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5078078550.359307775cfec4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.migrantchildren.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Migrant children's access to services- issues for policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>52AC0389-3114-4297-9F99-5C9D5D65AD56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation allowed members of the group to become familiar with the findings from the research conducted with Eastern European families and its implications for policy and practice.
