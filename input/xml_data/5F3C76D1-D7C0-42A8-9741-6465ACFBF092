CKD can have serious implications for those affected including a risk of CKD progressing to complete kidney failure so that the affected person requires replacement of kidney function by dialysis treatment or kidney transplantation. Kidney disease is expensive with a high proportion of the health-care budget spent on people with CKD; the cost of dialysis treatment alone is ~&amp;pound;30,000/year. Patient quality of life can be poor, with dialysis leading to early death. Treating high blood pressure (BP) is the most important intervention that can slow progression of CKD to total kidney failure. Some people with CKD gain additional protection from drugs called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs). These drugs treat high BP but also slow CKD progression by changing the pressure in the kidney. This may also influence hormone pathways that contribute to the decline of kidney function. However recent research suggests that in some people with advanced CKD (stages 4 &amp;amp; 5) who are progressing to complete kidney failure and are receiving treatment with an ACEi and/ or ARB, stopping these drugs leads to stabilization and improvement of kidney function and decreases or delays the need for dialysis treatment. This indicates that in some patients the very tablets that are being used to protect the kidneys may be contributing to a harmful decline in their function by some currently unknown mechanism. To date, the research on this is observational and to confirm the association between stopping these drugs and stabilization of kidney function requires a study to compare the outcomes of a group of people who have had these drugs stopped with a group who continue on the drug. This is called a randomised controlled trial (RCT). In the STOP-ACEi trial we will randomly allocate suitable participants (by chance) to either continue or to stop their ACEi/ARB treatment and then to follow-up these participants for 3-years. This study is needed before this treatment strategy can be put into routine clinical practice. In addition we will look at other effects of stopping these drugs such as effects on heart attacks, strokes and participant quality of life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Clinical studies have suggested that as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses, the number of filters (nephrons) in the kidney decreases causing the pressure in each filter to rise, leading to a vicious cycle of progressive damage of the surviving filters. RCTs showed that ACEi/ARBs, by blocking RAAS and specifically reducing this increase in filter pressure, slowed CKD progression over and above their effect on systemic BP. However, recent research, including an observational study by one of the applicants, has indicated in a subgroup of people with advanced progressive CKD (stages 4-5) there is stabilization or improvement of kidney function on discontinuing of ACEi/ARBs. If confirmed, this observation has profound clinical implications as trial evidence is lacking. We and others, in various cohorts of CKD patients, have shown that patients with more rapid progression of eGFR have worse outcomes. We therefore, propose an RCT to test the hypothesis that in patients with CKD stages 4 or 5, who are undergoing a progressive and sustained decline in kidney function, stopping ACEi/ARBs compared with continuing these treatments, leads to an improvement in kidney function with the potential for direct clinical benefit. We plan to randomize 410 patients with advanced (stages 4 or 5) progressive CKD to either continue their normal drug treatment or to stop ACEi/ARB. This will give 80% power (alpha=0.05) to detect a 5ml/min difference between arms (using SD=16ml/min, effect size=0.31) in estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate at 3 years (including 20% drop-out rate). This effect size is well below that reported in the index pilot study at one year. This change in GFR over the three year study period will therefore be a direct surrogate marker for future dialysis therapy and potential mortality for which there is substantial literature to support the relationship. There is excellent evidence to show acceptable accuracy of eGFR compared to gold standard measurements of kidney function (measured GFR (including Iohexol clearance).The results of such a study would then allow the design of a larger randomised study with mortality as the primary end-point. Patients will be recruited from at least 12 UK nephrology units at a rate of 2/month/centre. Data on laboratory (e.g. proteinuria), clinical (e.g. dialysis) and quality of life measures will be collected. The analysis will be by intention to treat, and according to a pre-specified analysis plan. The trial has been designed in collaboration with renal units with a strong track record in this type of research, an eminent cardiologist with huge experience in clinical trials, nurses, patient groups and the University of Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU) and is supported by the UK Kidney Research Consortium (UKKRC) and British Renal Association CKD Clinical Studies Group (CSG). The trial will be managed by the BCTU, a UKCRC registered CTU which is already co-ordinating 4 on-going large-scale randomized trials in renal disease: ASTRAL; PEXIVAS, PREDNOS and GloMY. If this study confirms that renal function is stabilised or improved following the withdrawal of ACEi/ARBs, then the NHS would save substantial per person per year costs on drugs (&amp;pound;250), dialysis (~&amp;pound;30,000) and transplantation (&amp;pound;15,000 initial then &amp;pound;3,000 annually).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>244204</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Pharmacy</gtr:department><gtr:description>MRC START nested study</gtr:description><gtr:id>F33996A7-FE72-4E9F-B505-ACDD38551B62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Engagement activity - START MMI website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c27c1c6cfde9.67789038-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The START team assisted with development of a multimedia intervention consisting of a website and video clips about the trial, akin to an electronic version of the patient information for the trial.
