Environment</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K037366/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The aim of this project is to develop and test through real-world research, a digital platform and toolkit that will enable members of the public to engage with local councils and other organisations more effectively in the research, planning and design of the urban environment.

The specific domain of this project is people's experiences of mobility and access to the urban environment, and how this changes with age. The project is a collaboration with City Councils in the Northeast Region, and Newcastle's' Age Friendly city initiative. Through VoiceNorth will engage members of the public in the project as co-researchers and co-designers, to collect a body of quantitative and qualitative data on older people's experiences of mobility in the built environment, and to co-design digital tools, information and services to enhance that experience. 

To achieve this we will design and develop a toolkit of digital sensors to capture evidence and experiences from older people's journeys through and social interactions within the city centre. We will combine this evidence with social research data through interactive architectural visualisations which will support citizens and stakeholder in participatory design of the age friendly city. 

We will also develop a participatory design platform which will allow members of the general public to access, comment, and vote on design issues, and to add their own experiences of access and the built environment. This extended public engagement in the research and design activities will offer a new model of public engagement in civic decision making.

The toolkit and platform will be validated through the design of and deployment of digital interventions in the city. We will also document our findings for policy makers and other stakeholders regionally and nationally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this research is to develop a technical platform and methodology to enable more inclusive and more democratic participation in decision-making concerning our built environment. The particular focus will be on older people's experiences of mobility and place, and how architects, designers, local governments and other service providers can engage with evidence about these experiences. More than this however, our aim is for the platform and methodology to allow citizens and service providers to work together in analyzing and interpreting data and in designing tools and services for the future age-friendly city. The key point here is that the platform and methodology will allow service providers and service users to engage with one another much more deeply and effectively than traditional methods of consultation. Consequently, we would anticipate the economic and social impact of this project to be significant and we would envisage our routes to impact ensuring effective impact not only locally but nationally (see routes to impact n case for support). Currently the Age Friendly City initiative in Newcastle have signed the Dublin Declaration and this work will strengthen the city's understanding of the evidence base and what needs to be achieved to become part of the WHO Age Friendly City network and importantly ensure our communities are age friendly.

Our research methodology is user-centred and involves working together with members of the public as co-researchers gathering evidence and experiences of mobility in the built environment, and also using that data to recommend and co-design new user-centred services. Members of the public in the Northeast will be involved in design workshops and in data gathering activities, but in addition to these face-face collaborations our participatory platform will allow on-line citizens to be engaged in sharing their experiences and comments and evaluating design proposals. 

Our partners have been chosen to represent a wide range of potential economic and social impact routes (e.g. local government, architecture firms, social housing providers, age related charities, volunteer and participant networks). These partners thus represent a diverse range of stakeholders in the provision of services for older people who could potentially make use of our platform and methodology beyond the life of the project. Our platform and methodology will be developed as an open source project.

Beyond the impact we achieve through our co-research a co-design with citizens and stakeholders, The project will deliver some design interventions that will positively impact the experience of mobility in the city for all citizens. More significantly however, through the open sourcing of the developed platform and methodology, we hope to have a significant impact on how public consultation and decision-making occurs nationally. Our partners (e.g. Age UK, Age Friendly City initiative, Years Ahead) will be instrumental in this wider engagement (see routes to impact) 

Finally this project will take place in the context of Newcastle University's commitment to a civic engagement agenda and to making research relevant to the real world. To execute this agenda, the university has launched three societal challenge themes on Ageing, Sustainability and Social Renewal, each with an institute to ensure a sustained commitment. Of particular relevance to this proposal is Newcastle Initiative on Changing Age is helping to generate an increased volume of connected research including exciting new inter-disciplinary collaborations. This will support sustained engagement and brings together world-leading scientific research with innovative health care, business, civic agencies and the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1301005</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tyneside Cinema</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Tyneside Cinema</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE823375-0191-4630-B197-42A83C8E336D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Initial findings were reported to Tyneside Cinema and used in their planning of a follow-up programme.

In 2015, these screenings were documented via a pilot study carried out by Brittain, using Open Lab's lightweight feedback technology ThoughtCloud. The pilot identified and overcame barriers and stigma to enable people living with dementia, their carers, companions and families to come to the cinema and watch a series of classic films and musicals. The simple steps and care that was taken in developing Dementia Friendly Cinema enabled people who are often excluded, to enjoy an everyday cultural experience in a supportive, friendly and social environment. The pilot was very successful and had a dramatic impact on both the cinema's staff and operations and the audience members. The Tyneside's DFC programme is now being presented across the UK and Ireland as an exemplar of how to set up such a programme, and researchers are still engaged in evaluating the project via observational methods and interviews with attendees as it progresses over time.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nexus</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nexus Metro Futures Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D6A4F61-D00F-42A6-A7E3-C028C5556E51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A full findings report is currently being prepared for Nexus.

This collaborative project called Metro Futures, has undertaken a 9 month joint project in which the MyPlace team have been responsible for Citizen-led Service design improvement for the metro train carriages. The MyPlace team organised a series of workshops in which citizens collected data about their experiences of metro travel and worked together to identify themes and design ideas for the future carriages. This design work was shared with the public via a participatory platform (https://metrofutures.org.uk). Members of the public can read comment and vote on design suggestions via the platform. The work has fed directly into NEXUS's bid for funding to commission the design of the next generation carriages. The contribution of MYPlace to the Nexus project was mentioned explicitly in a Parliamentary event run at the House of Parliament. 
Citizen participants in the project covered a range of ages 11-70, a range of disabilities/mobilities (visually impaired, hearing impaired, well chair users) and a range of geographical and socio- economic) backgrounds.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PARKLIFE- Newcastle City Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>614A696E-E02B-4C83-939C-3B14A857FDDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two findings reports have been produced for Newcastle City Council (confidential).

The project began in 2016 and is still on-going. Through this collaboration we have worked extensively with members of the public, the Newcastle Arks Forum, Park Rangers, Ark Volunteers and the council themselves. The collaboration began with extensive field research about current an future uses of the parks. A series of workshops were designed to allow participants to envision the futures of the Parks with specific reference to spending cuts and the idea of turning over the running of the parks to charitable trusts. The MyPlace team led by Clara Crivellaro, designs a board game to structure the consultations and design discussions and reported findings back the Newcastle City Council. In the second phase of the research the MyPlace team worked with the Company Social Finance UK (http://www.socialfinance.org.uk) who were commissioned by the council to deliver a target operational model of the Parks in a second round of public consultations and consultations with councillors. The findings were reported to the Council and in the third phase of the study the team built a digital platform &amp;quot;Lets Talk Parks&amp;quot; (https://letstalkparks.co.uk) that allows members of the public to engage with the findings so far and with further public workshops. This third phase began in March 2017 and is on-going until May 2017. A do-it-yourself version of the board game has been designed to allow Newcastle City Council's own community engagement officers facial the design workshops.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Design for Wellbeing Seminar Oxford Brookes April 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EFD5F3C-CD37-4BEB-9319-C29945FFDEEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and facilitated session on co-production as part of Seminar at Oxford Brookes University.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e15e6fe728f6.32285145</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bit.ly/1FkgPb2</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentations to Newcastle University Business School 3rd March</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF39285D-071A-48E0-BDBA-15208D171E80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two talks presented By Peter Wright and by Clara Crivellaro To Newcastle University Business School about MyPlace case studies as best practice examples of co-production and service design.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9a6b58bb758.39280717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Collaborative Housing, Mutual Support &amp; Specialist Care Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEA8A2BE-0E23-4563-9F92-D1A98B72A01B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar series from ESRC invited to discuss collaborative housing, mutual support &amp;amp; specialist care including members of the public and partners such as Age Friendly City initiative.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e15f16599d32.77077797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://collaborativehousing.net/seminars/four/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation on MyPlace Activities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5259FF91-E37D-46AD-B90F-DCAA27FC8B18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk presented at the Cooperative Neighbourhoods Working togged event organised by Newcastle University. 25th January 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9a578eb0729.00851820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future Cities Development Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAE8087A-301A-4FAF-84A5-CAB2398818BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have presented current software/ hardware development and research from Open Lab and the Virtual Newcastle Gateshead model to the Future Cities Development Group (FCDG) to encourage more strategic alignment with future research.

The first workshop in June 2014 encouraged discussion on what collaborative research could mean in the context of citizen engagement in urban planning and development and a number of presentations from academic collaborators were presented to discuss. The second workshop which took place in January 2015 was to plan specific case studies with partners on specific projects partners were working on. As a result researchers were able to take forward future work with partners focusing on Grainger Market, Grainger Street, cycling infrastructure and associated consultation with older adults, and future workshops with Henshaws.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e14e05b7f043.72330803</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dementia Friendly Places App Evaluation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07F320A0-2976-4820-BE94-F3BD7BE98FCA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the MYPLACE project the team develop &amp;quot;Care and Connect&amp;quot; and App that allowed people with dementia Sandor their carers to rate places for their dementia friendliness.

These engagements consisted of two workshops (12 participants in each), and six one-on-one engagements with carers who expressed a wish to be met alone. Most of our participants were carers with family members in the early to mid stages of dementia (20), although we also had two participants with dementia, six with family members in late stages of dementia, and two who were ex-carers, their family member having passed away.

The workshop took place at the Bike Hub, cafe and cycle workshop, at the Quayside in Newcastle.

The outcome of the workshop highlighted particular qualities of routes that older people who were just coming back to cycling liked to look out for when finding places to go. The workshop also highlighted the significance of social recommendation of routes and trusting those who had similar cycling experiences and interests. We fed these insights back to staff at the Bike Hub and to project co-ordinators at Newcastle City Council who are developing health and well-being programmes around cycling. As a result we are now further developing an app and website around particular qualities of cycling focused on social and well-being benefits rather than performance related health benefits such as supported with other more commercial health related digital services.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e15dcde788b2.40453119</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Elders Council Newsletter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>89338ED7-8F4A-40D8-8A4D-3FAED03A1939</gtr:id><gtr:impact>After taking part in design workshops, a small group of Elders Council shared their experiences as part of 2 of their quarterly newsletters which reaches an audience of approximately 2000 older people in Newcastle.

As a result of these workshops we were able to highlight the challenges facing the public more generally, but older people in particular in contributing to discussions on urban planning. While we used technology to collect evidence about people's experiences of particular places, using audio-visual data and maps, the technology helped to focus the group on what they felt was important about the specific places we visited and gave them confidence to discuss their particular concerns with planners and engineers in the context of new transport infrastructures. We were able to take these insights back to Newcastle City Council to discuss future potential of technologies to support such forms of communication and exchange and we are now in the process of working on designs to support future work in this area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e152ed41c380.04424170</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.myplace.ac.uk/index.php/community-exchange/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3713739</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Digital Economy Research Centre</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RES/0550/7405</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B35CBB1A-B924-4E42-8DC9-5BFAA99339CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9a830a31f67.07522678</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4707329</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training</gtr:department><gtr:description>Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Civics</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Imperial College London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/L016176/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FEACB7BD-81D7-413C-B7E6-1D7FDC2C827F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9ab40eea567.52414674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Institute for Social Renewal</gtr:department><gtr:description>Newcastle Institute for Social Renewal Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Newcastle University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CE8BEE96-8B24-49E1-9ECC-5D3056B704A0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca7950604f11.22770841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have been working with the following organisations through whom we have been engaging members of the public and other stakeholders.

Our Academic impact reflects the breadth of our interdisciplinary project, from publications in world leading HCI conferences and journals to social/human geography and social gerontology. We have a number of publications in preparation which will consolidate these early successes. Our engagement with non-academic stockholders can be summarised under the three concluding case studies that we are currently engaged in, namely: Let's Talk Park; Metro Futures; and Dementia Friendly Places. For each of these case studies there has been significant engagement and co-production of research. 

Let's Talks Parks
The MyPlace Research team were approached by Newcastle City Council to undertake an extended case study for citizen-led design around the future of Newcastle City's parks and Green spaces. The project began in 2016 and is on-going. Through this collaboration we have worked extensively with members of the public, the Newcastle Parks Forum, Park Rangers, Park Volunteers and the council themselves. The collaboration began with extensive field research about current an future uses of the parks. A series of workshops were designed to allow participants to envision the futures of the parks with specific reference to spending cuts and the idea of turning over the running of the parks to a charitable trust. The MyPlace team led by Clara Crivellaro, designsed a board game (Parks 2026) to structure the consultations and design discussions and report findings back to Newcastle City Council. In the second phase of the research the MyPlace team worked with the company Social Finance UK (http://www.socialfinance.org.uk) who were commissioned by the council to deliver a Target Operational Model of the parks. Wei worked with Social Finance to design and deliver a second round of public consultations and consultations with councillors. The findings were reported to the council and in the third phase of the study the team built a digital platform &amp;quot;Lets Talk Parks&amp;quot; (https://letstalkparks.co.uk) that allows members of the public to engage with the findings so far and with further public workshops. This third phase began in March 2017 and is on-going until May 2017. A do-it-yourself version of the board game, Parks2026 has been designed to allow Newcastle City Council's own community engagement officers facilitate the design workshops.

Metro Futures:
The MyPlace Research team, led by Simon Bowen have collaborated with NEXUS (http://www.nexus.org.uk) who run the NE Metro trains. This collaborative project called Metro Futures, has undertaken a 9 month joint project in which the MyPlace team have been responsible for citizen-led service design improvement for the metro train carriages. The MyPlace team organised a series of workshops in which citizens collected data about their experiences of metro travel and worked together to identify themes and design ideas for the future carriages. This design work was shared with the public via a participatory platform (https://metrofutures.org.uk). Members of the public can read comment and vote on design suggestions via the platform. The work has fed directly into NEXUS's bid for funding to commission the design of the next generation carriages. The contribution of MYPlace to the Nexus project was mentioned explicitly in a Parliamentary event run at the House of Parliament. 
citizen participants in the project covered a range of ages 11-70, a range of disabilities/mobilities (visually impaired, hearing impaired, well chair users) and a range of geographical and socio- economic) backgrounds. Nexus, have supported the project through advertising campaigns and they have contributed to the design or the workshops and the platform. They provided access to metro carriages for our design work with school children. A full findings report is currently being prepared for Nexus. This will feed into the bid and tendering process that Nexus will complete in May 2017.

Dementia Friendly Places:
This case study led by Katie Brittain and Kellie Morrisey, and Cate Degnan, has explored the idea of the &amp;quot;dementia-friendly&amp;quot; communities and explored what this might mean in practice. This has been realised through a number of different channels of engagement and co-design work:

- 'Care and Connect', is a mobile application created through the App Movement platform for MyPLACE. The app allows users to identify and rate public places (e.g., parks, shops, cafes) on their 'dementia-friendliness' - their suitability for people with dementia and their carers. Care and Connect saw significant support in its early stages on the online platform, yet failed to engage participants in its design phase and deployment. To unpick this, we contribute an account of its initial use in the community, and then describe findings from research engagements with carers and people with dementia. These workshops used Care and Connect to structure discussions of participants' own experiences of dementia-friendliness, and uncovered themes of 1) trust, 2) exclusion versus inclusion, 3) duration and quality of time, and 4) empathy becoming action. Using this evidence, we advance an account of online community commissioning as a process which needs to understand not only the general issues ongoing in communities facing significant life challenges, but also the particularity of community members' experiences. This paper was awarded an Honourable Mention, which means that it is ranked among the top 5% of all submissions to the SIGCHI 2017 conference. The conference received over 2400 submissions and 97 were chosen for Honorable Mention. This designation will be included in the program and a paper award for all authors will be made available at the conference in Denver.

- This work also formed the basis for a successful follow-on funding grant from the Newcastle Institute of Social Renewal in 2016 (&amp;pound;3000 + &amp;pound;3000 matched from Open Lab). This funded project extends our previous scoping work on dementia-friendly communities (DFCs) in Newcastle Upon Tyne. An Alzheimer's Society-backed initiative, DFCs have seen recent criticism given a lack of definition on what 'dementia-friendliness' might entail. Additionally, the sole two DFC projects in Newcastle have been in Jesmond and Gosforth, historically affluent areas. This project will explore dementia-friendliness in South Heaton, where many ageing residents face significant challenges stemming from social inequality. This project aims to: a) explore local opportunities for dementia-friendliness, and b) develop a set of digital tools to allow members of the local community to commission and co-design their own DFC events. This project is anticipated to run from April 2017-July 2017 and will support the MSc project of Tom Ford, a MSc student in Computing Science.

- Ongoing work with the Jesmond Dementia Action Alliance (a local organisation seeking to make the Jesmond area in Newcastle dementia-friendly, and supported by the Alzheimer's Society) resulted in a successful funding bid (&amp;pound;10k) to the Big Lottery Fund, authored by Morrissey and Hames of JDAA. This award will fund three cultural activity threads which would run as part of a 'Dementia-Friendly Programme' of activities at Jesmond Pool (community facility with room for hire). 

- A corollary to the JDAA work, Morrissey has been supporting the Semitones, a local amateur orchestra, by observing their concerts at local care homes for people with dementia. This is work supported by an earlier funding bid by the Semitones, and will lead to a series of speaking engagements in Newcastle surrounding a) previous empirical research on dementia and music and b) particular findings from these practice engagements.

- Researchers on MyPlace have been involved with the iterative design of dementia-friendly cinema screenings at the Tyneside Cinema. In 2015, these screenings were documented via a pilot study carried out by Brittain, using Open Lab student Andy Dow's lightweight feedback technology ThoughtCloud. The pilot identified and overcame barriers and stigma to enable people living with dementia, their carers, companions and families to come to the cinema and watch a series of classic films and musicals. The simple steps and care that was taken in developing Dementia Friendly Cinema enabled people who are often excluded, to enjoy an everyday cultural experience in a supportive, friendly and social environment. The pilot was very successful and had a dramatic impact on both the cinema's staff and operations and the audience members. The Tyneside's DFC programme is now being presented across the UK and Ireland as an exemplar of how to set up such a programme, and researchers are still engaged in evaluating the project via observational methods and interviews with attendees as it progresses over time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3D03486B-775E-42A5-8B68-4EF7B22773D1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5475e364c28888.03187251</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Aims and Interim Findings
The stated aims of this project were twofold; 
1. To develop a digital participatory platform, associated methodology and model of public engagement to allow citizens to better participate in the design of urban environments with a special focus on the age-friendly future city;
2. To test the platform and methods by using it to build an evidence base of peoples' mobility in, and experiences of, the urban environment of Newcastle upon Tyne, and to use this evidence-base as the starting point for co-designing age-friendly interventions with citizens and city councils. 
We have sought to achieve these aims by working closely with partners such as Newcastle City Council, Nexus, the Alzheimer's Society, and local actions groups such as Jesmond Dementia Action Alliance as well as members of the public. 

As intended we used our early field work to inform the design of a prototype platforms some of which were focussed on to provide the final case studies. These are Let's Talk Parks, MetroFutures, and Dementia-Friendly Places (see collaborations and engagements). Each of these case studies has were developed in response to our partners and stakeholders actual needs rather than designed as 'academic' case studies. That is to say, these are real-world engaged projects undertaken by our partners that will impact how they designed and and roll out services in Newcastle and the Region. 

Models and Methods
Although there is variation in our case studies to date, and the findings are interim, the generic model of citizen-led, co-research and design we are working towards is grounded in our earlier research on experience-centred design, and involves the following phases:

1) A core group of citizens and other stakeholders are recruited to act as co-researchers

2) Co-researchers are engaged in a series of co-located workshops. In the first of phase of these co-researchers document their experiences of mobility and place in the city using a variety of digital tools developed for the project. This include phone-based video and audio recording apps, tweets and bespoke delivered scenarios.

3) In the second phase or workshops, co-researchers use the platform to share, analyse, annotate and interpret the data they have collectively gathered and edit it for public use as seed data.

4) A campaign is launched to advertise the data available on the platform and the design challenge to the public and other interested organisations.

5) The general public and other interested organisations can participate through the platform by studying the experiences seeded by the co-researchers, commenting on design ideas and making them for relevance and importance.

6) Meta data is used to identify themes and design issues to be included in Design proposals and recommendations put forward.

Field Work 
The majority of ethnographic Fieldwork has reached its conclusion and findings have informed the participatory platform and tools development which has led into the final case studies (Nexus and Lets Talk Parks, Dementia Friendly Places) ). This includes our studies of Grainger Market and our work with the Italian Migrant Community, Cycling communities in Rotterdam and Newcastle, and community mapping workshops with the Elders Council.

Tools and Platforms
A range of digital tools have been used. These were developed in Open Lab either specifically for MyPlace or adapted for specific uses by MyPlace, and include:
Bootlegger, App movement/care and connect, ThoughtCloud, Journey Cam, Metro Futures and Let's talk Parks. (For details see software and tools). 

We have postponed further development of the Senior Cycles platform with a view to integrating it into a generic journey mapping platform at a later date. The Urban Narrative Environments platform and the crowd sourced Eyetracking platform platform is still under development and testing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Much of our early fieldwork has been reported in academic papers and also used to understand the requirements for our digital technology toolkit and platforms.

A number of prototype tools and platforms have been deployed and tested in real-world co-research projects with citizens the findings from which have been used to engage local council and other public sector organisations to inform policy and design relating to aspects of city and regional developments including the future of Newcastle's parks and green spaces, and the design of the next generation of Metro trains for the NE region. The three final case studies will be written up for academic audiences over the summer. 

When complete we hope to use our case studies and their digital technology as part of a City Demonstrator project through Newcastle City Futures (http://www.newcastlecityfutures.org/). We have follow-on funding for further research through the Digital Economy Research Centre and the Digital Civics programme (https://digitalcivics.io/) to further develop and use our platforms.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5F599637-498A-4831-B3F0-BC1C44DCFA8C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dea1169a3cb9.29062623</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.myplace.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Tools and PLatforms
A range of digital tools have been used. These were developed in Open Lab either specifically for MyPlace or adapted for specific uses by MyPlace, and include:
Bootlegger, App movement/care and connect, ThoughtCloud, Journey Cam, Metro Futures and Let's talk Parks. (For details see software and tools). 

Bootlegger is a mobile phone application for shooting and managing high-quality multi-camera video footage. Teams of people can connect with one another to jointly create a video, where the app helps to co-ordinate shots according to where individuals are located and automatically uploads videos to the cloud enabling teams to share footage. Events covered by Bootlegger include the Great North Run and Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It has been used in the MyPlace project to allow co-researchers on the Metro Futures project to record their experiences of Metro Journeys. 
App Movement is a community based website that allows groups to create their own mobile applications to review particular locations. Communities start campaigns by developing an idea and sharing this through their online social networks, gathering votes, designing and launching their app. A diversity of apps have already been developed including Feed-Finder (location-based reviews for breast-feeding mothers). In MyPlACE it has been used as part of the Dementia-Friendly Places Case study to commission the production of the Care &amp;amp; Connect dementia friendly places rating app.
ThoughtCloud is a feedback tool designed to invite people to express their thoughts. Organisations are able to pose questions about services and gather data in the form of ratings, video or audio messages on tablets. This feedback is then collated and displayed on a website where it can be organised, commented on or shared. ThoughtCloud has been used for feedback on cultural events including drama workshops for people with disabilities. It has been used in the Dementia Friendly Places case study, specifically dementia-friendly cinema events- to get feedback form audiences. It has also been used in the Metro Futrues study to 
JourneyCam is a bespoke phone app and phone mounting device that that can be fitted to wheel chairs and operated by a single button press and records audio and video footage of &amp;quot;what just happened&amp;quot;. It can be taken on journeys to record experiences and the data can be uploaded to the participatory platform. It is currently being used with wheelchair users to document and share their experiences of journeys into the city and using the Metro and which will be shared via the metro futures website. 
Bespoke Platforms
The Metro Futures and Let's talk Park platforms are variants of the same underlying software prototype. The platform allows co-researchers to upload audio and video data and to annotate these with meta data tags and add interpretative text. The co-researchers can then decide whether to keep their data private, share it with other co-researchers or make it available to all public subscribers to the platform. All participants with legitimate access can study, comment and rank data that is available to them and they can also add their own data for others to study comment on and rank issues in terms of relevance and importance.

By the end of the MyPlace project and through our follow-on funding, we aim to have a generic platform available to the public and our partners through which they can commission their own co-design projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9798BC15-31D0-4CDC-977B-9BDCAD437074</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These tools are currently being refined and developed through th project and will be released in their final forms for use by other project and interested parties, under a open licence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9a43f7eed16.44888724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory design and co-research tools and methods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Through App Movement, Care and Connect was commissioned for people to rate and find places that were friendly towards people with dementia.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFD2C709-EFCF-4B06-8A04-B6CAC75C5736</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The application is currently being distributed among local communities within Newcastle with a view to wider expansion in the future.
