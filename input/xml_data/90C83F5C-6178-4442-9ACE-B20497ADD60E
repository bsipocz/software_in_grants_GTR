At the same time concerns are being voiced about the 'appropriate' role and use of pharmaceuticals in the management of sleep problems, both inside and outside the doctors' surgery and the sleep clinic. This project provides a timely and topical social scientific investigation of these developments and debates. It focuses on sleep and wakefulness promoting drugs in contemporary Britain since 2000, framed in terms of the role of pharmaceuticals in the medical, social and personal management of sleep problems. The project will examine both 'upstream' issues regarding the development and regulation of sleep and wakefulness promoting drugs and 'downstream' issues regarding their meaning and use in medical practice and everyday/night life. These issues will be investigated through a qualitative, multi-method study comprising documentary sources, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and detailed case-studies with key stakeholders in field - ranging from sleep scientists, doctors and policymakers to patients, pressure groups and other key members of the public with an interest in these matters. Results will be communicated and disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences and user groups, including scientists, doctors, patients, pressure groups and policymakers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sleep, Medicines and Society dissemination event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF7C3239-C0E3-4A7B-921B-911F0F1422C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We gave 6 talks followed by an open discussion.

For example we have given talks to the British Science Festival and the British Sleep Society Annual Scientific Meeting to raise awareness of the sociological issues around sleep and sleep medicines. The former talk provided an opportunity to debate these issues with the general public while the latter involved discussions with clinicians and sleep scientists. Feedback suggested that we had enhanced people's understanding of these issues. At the BSF we meet a number of journalists who were interested in our presentation and this lead to our work being reported in the Financial Times ('Pharmacology: Sleeping pills - dream or nightmare' by Clive Cookson and Tyler Shendruk, Financial Times 22/9/14). 

We also talked about our research at a dissemination event held at Warwick university and attended by study participants, clinicians, sleep scientists, representatives from the voluntary sector and students. In a further attempt to reach primary care clinicians we provided copy for a newsletter aimed at these clinicians. And we also wrote a piece for the online magazine Discover Society to engage with as wide an audience as possible.

Finally we have been liaising with a representative from the voluntary sector organisation Oldham Tranx who in turn is putting us in touch with the All Party Parliamentary Group for Prescribed Drug Dependence. We hope to enhance the impact of our research by engaging with this group.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2E8AF64D-86B4-4D2A-9BEF-43C32C346631</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b4df65435479.06541806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Pharmaceuticalisation - the transformation of human conditions, capabilities and capacities into opportunities for pharmaceutical intervention.

Analysis across our data sets shows an uneven pharmaceuticalisation of the sleep-wake cycle. Substantially more hypnotics are prescribed in England (remaining stable at around 10 million since 2000) than wakefulness promoting drugs. 

Focus group data on the use of sleep/wakefulness medicines revealed evidence of patient/consumer resistance to pharmaceuticalisation. For example, some respondents (mainly non-users or ex-users of sleeping pills) rejected pharmaceuticals for sleep problems and preferred non-pharmacological therapies. Likewise, we found a general resistance to social uses of wakefulness promoting pharmaceuticals. 

Other respondents however provided support for pharmaceuticalisation by presenting themselves as deserving of pharmaceuticals, questioning medical authority when doctors suggested coming off them and, on occasion, seeking prescription drugs outside the medical encounter. The later evidence provides a challenge to the current depharmaceuticalisation of sleep agenda.

Documented cases of depharmaceuticalisation of sleep are rare. The process is thus best seen as fluid, particularly given recent CBTi-based interventions, although doctors and other sleep experts do not necessarily see CBTi as an alternative to medication. On this basis we conclude that the degree to which sleep problems are subject to (de)pharmaceuticalisation in the future remains uncertain.

2. Developments in sleep-promoting medications.
 
Drug development of hypnotics has been slow with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approving only two, Sonata (zapelon) and Circadin (melatonin) since 1999. The pharmaceutical industry's innovation strategy has been conservative, designed primarily to limit the adverse effects of benzodiazepines through marketing more Z drugs (Zopiclone, Zolpidem and Zaleplon). However, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Z drugs have no clinical advantages over benzodiazepines (e.g. in reducing dependence). Concurrently, there has been little attempt to address long- term insomnia, with the possible exception of Circadian, licenced for use up to 13 weeks, though chronic insomnia can last much longer. 

The regulatory system also discourages innovative drug development which could meet the challenge of long term insomnia. When innovations like Circadin are assessed for efficacy in clinical trials this is often based solely on comparisons with placebo, rather than with existing hypnotics.
 
3. The challenges for sleep promoting drugs. 

 A key challenge for pharmaceutical companies, given their stated aim of drug innovation, is the development of efficacious hypnotics for chronic insomnia without risk of dependence. This requires a decisive shift away from an innovation strategy based on marketing for the overuse of benzodiazepines and z-drugs. Crucial in achieving this are regulators who set the context in which the industry operates. Regulators should require new hypnotics to be compared with existing sleeping pills in clinical trials and demonstrate therapeutic advance. NICE needs to be more pro-active in encouraging cost-effective prescribing and the Government needs to take the problem of chronic insomnia more seriously by backing public health initiatives on how best to tackle this condition as part of a wider attempt to promote the sleep of the nation. Patient organisations too can lobby for access to new/existing medications and non-pharmacological alternatives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non-academic

(a) Patient organizations 

? To press pharmaceutical companies to adopt innovation strategies to tackle the unmet need of treatment for chronic insomnia. 
? To lobby for improved access to valued but difficult to obtain drugs (e.g. Narcolepsy UK and access to sodium oxybate).

(b) Expert advisers to regulatory agencies and senior medical professionals 

? To press regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct active-controlled trials of hypnotics. Doctors would have better knowledge of the comparative efficacy of the drug therapies available, rather than relying on the promotional claims of industry. 
? To shift the industry business model from investing in promotion to researching innovations offering therapeutic advance.

(c) NICE and other expert advisors (e.g. The Office of Fair Trading)

? NICE needs to look again at the cost-effectiveness of hypnotics, with a wider remit that investigates pricing policy and regulation.

(d) Sleep scientists, GPs and patients 

? To enhance understanding of sleep medications through awareness of each actor's perspective
? To develop guidelines for insomnia management in primary and secondary care.
