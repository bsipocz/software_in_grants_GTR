A great deal has been written about the historical and policy changes that have shaped the role of the probation officer but there has been little research on the changes to occupational cultures and the ways in which probation officers themselves view the impact of changes to their role. Similarly there is little research on the relationships between probation officers and other criminal justice agencies engaged in offender management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The planned research aims to fill these gaps by exploring three key questions: &lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>What are the characteristics of contemporary probation cultures and how do probation officers construct their occupational identities?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How might such cultures contribute to, or undermine, the effectiveness of offender management?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what extent is an understanding of probation cultures essential to achieving change within the National Offender Management Service and related criminal justice agencies? &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>To answer these questions, interviews will be conducted with samples of current and retired probation officers. Through this work, the research aims to make a contribution not only to the study of probation work but also to the body of knowledge on the occupational cultures of criminal justice practitioners. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77118</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar - Cambridge Institute of Criminology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E7C37631-62AE-4B43-A019-9B418BE90012</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar stimulated debate on 'edgework' in probation work, and the ways in which probation workers cope with change.

As a result of our research Professor Worrall was invited to be on a small working party to devise the Code of Ethics for the new Probation Institute - available at: http://probation-institute.org/code-ethics/ 

COST Action IS1106 on Offender Supervision in Europe. Following a plenary paper at a meeting of this COST Action in October 2013, our methodology from this project was adopted by the Institute of Criminological and Sociological Research in Belgrade, Serbia for a similar research project on the relatively new Serbian probation service.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AA171267-624F-4155-9501-15D1A1EEAB55</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b6d94ddc358.95847100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Probation workers come from a variety of backgrounds, although there are three identifiable broad groupings: 'lifers', 'second careerists' and 'offender managers'. They share certain core values such as recognising the human worth of offenders and believing in the ability of people to change but differ in their views on the source and operationalisation of those values within the contemporary political and organisational context of risk management and public protection.



? Much probation work now resembles other public sector office work, consisting of computer work in 'faceless' open plan offices and office appointments with offenders. However, probation workers have the opportunities to build a varied career, resulting in a widely experienced, multi-specialist workforce. The chances to move around help to satisfy their creative instincts and intellectual curiosity.



? Probation has become a 'feminised' occupation over the past two decades and this has important and possibly unexpected consequences for the cultures of the organisation.



? Doing probation work is stressful and workers have both individual and group coping mechanisms. Individual responses include seeking creativity and intensity in engaging with offenders and group responses include developing a sense of team solidarity.



? Probation work increasingly involves working with other agencies. Probation workers' relations with the courts are characterised by an immediacy that can be both testing and exciting at times. The probation-prison relationship remains complex and has become more problematic since the creation of NOMS (the National Offender Management Service). The improved relationship between the police and probation services is marked, but cultural differences remain.



? Probation workers feel that their work is not well understood by the general public and is ignored or distorted by the media. The self-effacing character of the probation service is not conducive to the proactive promotion of the organisation. The influence of NAPO on the cultures of probation work has declined but, paradoxically, it remains the most publicly recognisable voice of the service.



? Probation cultures vary across settings and over time but core features include: long office hours and group solidarity; high levels of organisation and computer literacy; multi-specialism; weariness and cynicism about the probation service and NOMS; a yearning for autonomy and opportunities to be responsibly creative; valuing thinking and reflecting; managing emotional responses (their own and those of offenders); belief in change and their own ability to effect (and affect) it; probation work as 'more than just a job'; feminisation; liminality (a willingness to work 'on the edge' and in the 'gaps').



? Probation cultures are complex but, if properly understood, enhance rather than undermine the supervision of offenders and 'offender management', however interpreted. Attempts to dismantle or dilute probation cultures, however, could be counter-productive by loosening the 'ties that bind' probation workers to an 'honourable profession'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has not only pursued advances in academic understanding, but has also been used in non-academic contexts to inform policy making and to raise awareness of probation work. The study generated outputs and activities that will inform the development of the policy and practice of 'Offender Management' thereby contributing to the effectiveness of public services and policy. 



Dr Mawby and Professor Worrall have engaged in relevant Ministry of Justice policy consultations, have kept the Probation Chiefs Association (PCA) appraised of the project findings, have disseminated 'plain English' publications, invited probation workers of all grades to the project conference, and Professor Worrall has continued to work with the PCA with a view to improving links between the organisation and academics specialising in probation studies and research.



In addition to impact at this policy and practice level, Dr Mawby and Professor Worrall have attempted to increase awareness of probation work at a public level through public lectures and within the magistracy (including a presentation at a workshop funded by the Magistrates Association on the future of the magistracy). This was considered to be an important level of impact given the low public profile of probation work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF1CD34C-25FE-4314-9DDD-9C555B47B713</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4396094041.314064b2f2404c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/research/current-projects/rim3_culture_probation</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>COST Action IS1106 on Offender Supervision in Europe</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB9EF106-84CB-4A19-9E11-F3D9E2A237F6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b69091c1958.32286907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Probation Institute</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3BD23D2-6C64-486D-9B0A-B34D1FDDBD3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b6a40a9db53.38214727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05B431C7-C3F9-4440-96DB-4473086BA835</gtr:id><gtr:title>Doing Probation Work: Identity in a Criminal Justice Occupation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/60a986dce88b6bc8b3699aa672c288a2"><gtr:id>60a986dce88b6bc8b3699aa672c288a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mawby Rob</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415540285</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_95212680893b9680c6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC9CCCFD-C7CE-4CD5-A79F-555E1ACFD2A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Working with offenders: Someone has to do it ... but not just anyone can.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Community Justice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/265d68cd27176cfbafb82c489f1d04ef"><gtr:id>265d68cd27176cfbafb82c489f1d04ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mawby R C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544e15d6ae6452.88760916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B9BA6D1-ED8D-4213-A64C-10EAF64CBF82</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unlikely edgeworkers : probation workers and voluntary risk-taking</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ECAN Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/87786476c23b28be8bc4f63b94d6cb61"><gtr:id>87786476c23b28be8bc4f63b94d6cb61</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Worrall A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544e18f01ed8e2.73034853</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AAB0E436-2D6E-4EB5-A52A-C11A49ABCCB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Probation worker responses to turbulent conditions: Constructing identity in a tainted occupation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Australian &amp;
