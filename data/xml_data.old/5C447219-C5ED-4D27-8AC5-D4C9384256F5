Psychosocial, Organisational and Economic Perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M00189X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This Seminar Series has been designed to critically discuss our current knowledge relevant to the working lives of those of employment age with cancer and to do so from the social science perspective with a focus on psychosocial, organisational and economic issues. It is multi-disciplinary in nature and considers the European context to the area. Its objectives are threefold: to shape the research agenda for the future, to help develop research capacity, and to support the translation of current knowledge into policy and practice. In doing these things, it is hoped that the seminar series will promote the contribution of the social sciences to this important area.

The seminars will review and discuss six different perspectives each reflecting on the involvement an important stakeholder group. These range from that of the person with cancer, through those of the health care professionals, the employers and their occupational health providers, those involved with legal and insurance matters to those concerned with the labour market and wider economic contexts. The final seminar in this cluster will concern the European perspective. These 6 seminars will be framed by 3 seminars that have been designed to manage the development of the series in terms of the knowledge gained, lessons learned and conclusions arrived at. These development seminars will assure the effective delivery of the seminar series outputs.

The seminar series will deliver four different outputs in the short to medium term. First, those involved will publish a short series of papers and an edited volume which will capture the content of the seminars; the background, the discussions and the conclusions. Second, it will also produce a series of short Guidance Notes tailored to the needs of the key stakeholder groups. Third, it will build a collaboration towards an application for funding under the Horizon 2020 (Societal Issues) Programme. Finally, as part of this initiative it will establish a development programme for early Career Researchers in this area involving them, as appropriate, in the funding bid and in any subsequent research.

The importance of the seminar series lies not just in the issue that it addresses but also in the ways that it will shape future research and support the exploitation of current knowledge to better understand and manage the engagement in work of those with cancer. Beyond this, it attempts to secure the future in this area through the development of young researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The objectives for the series are focused both on the development of the research agenda and on the translation of current knowledge into policy and practice. Furthermore, the underlying beliefs are that many of the key issues for a better understanding and management of policy and practice are essentially the remit of the social sciences and that the contribution made by the disciplines involved needs to be developed and promoted. Together, these objectives, in the context of the underlying beliefs, should bring benefit to those of working age with cancer, those who are involved in their diagnosis, treatment and aftercare, employers and associated employment bodies and services, and to the wider economy. These eventual outcomes are essentially about national health and national wealth. Finally, the promotion of the social sciences in this area is critically dependent on capacity in research and, therefore, on the development of Early Career Researchers. Impact can be conceptualized in these terms: a table suggesting measures of impact is presented in the proposal.

Short Term Pathways
Social media will be developed to support public engagement using freely available systems such as Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin with RSS feeds. These accounts will be advertised through appropriate online sites such as Macmillan Cancer Support. They will stay active after the seminars ended so that interested members of the public can follow and contribute to the translation of research into policy and practice. The project website will be developed as an information portal (including podcasts and lay summaries of research related outputs).

Medium Term Pathways
Two papers are planned for peer reviewed journals which will summarise the findings and conclusions of the seminars in Cancer Survivorship and in Occupational Medicine. Both journals are widely read by those working in this area, the first by researchers in psychosocial oncology and the later by medical practitioners and researchers involved in cancer related areas. These papers will be developed from the discussions in the Development Seminars and the summaries provided by the Rapporteurs at the Discussion Seminars. An edited volume or monograph is also planned based on the Keynote papers presented at the Discussion Seminars and the subsequent formal commentaries and open discussions. These contributions will be supplemented as appropriate by invited contributions from the stakeholder groups. It is also planned to publish short Guidance Notes tailored to specific stakeholder groups involved with the diagnosis, treatment, aftercare and employment of those with cancer covering both policy and operational issues. These notes will be developed with significant input from the stakeholders involved in the seminar series and may be published with one of the cancer charities (or ESRC) or another organisation relevant to a stakeholder group.

Medium to Long Term Pathways
The seminar series will act as a vehicle for a collaborative bid to Horizon 2020 for research funds in the area of cancer survivorship and working life. The starting point for this bid will be a critical review of the research proposed by the METIS Collaboration submission to the 2013 ESRC MRC Call on Extending the Working Life of Older Workers (short listed). In association with a Horizon 2020 Bid, it is proposed to explore the possibility of an cross-university Development Programme for Early Career Researchers with the involvement of some in the Horizon Bid and subsequent research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Salford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The METIS Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7D8B225-5809-4357-99C2-DE9A6660CD0B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funding:

As such, its impact cannot yet be fully determined. The methodology for that determination will prove interesting and useful in itself. 

Most probably, the evaluation of impact will be different from that of pure research. Here, it may depend in part on the success of the network and website site / portal aspects of the project and on the spread of knowledge sharing. Their development, successful or otherwise, will be one marker of impact. In addition, the success or otherwise of the planned follow-on activities, based on dissemination and further discussion opportunities, will also inform any evaluation of impact.

A number of things are becoming clear. First, there has been much interest in the seminar series and in the different activities associated with the award. In particular, although there are a number of existing networks in existence that focus on aspects of cancer and employment, there is a clear need and an interest in developing the sort of network that this award is developing; one based on the translation of current knowledge into policy and practice involving those actively involved in those areas. Second, there is a real need to offer advice and mentoring to ECRs in this area and to help enhance opportunities to continue in the area working in an extended group. Finally, despite the plethora of booklets (etc) and websites, there is no internet-enhanced system or network for supporting those working in the area and those with cancer that marries local (on the ground) support with regional or national expertise and which can both support learning and itself learn. These things were anticipated in the development of the proposal for this award and feedback, so far, suggests that they were not misguided.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1CCC10F8-7FFC-46C5-BF52-F8EBB3F0332E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df355df2fd55.42343483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminars have been designed to attract multi-disciplinary and multi-professional audiences. So far five Discussion seminars have been held and the sixth and final seminar is planned for mid 2017. These have been focused on the perspectives of those diagnosed with cancer and of their families (at Aberdeen), the economic and labour market contexts to cancer and employment (at Newcastle) and the legal and insurance industry involvements (at Birkbeck). These Discussion seminars have been supported by three Development seminars, all held at Birkbeck, that have reviewed progress, drawn out lessons learned and planned the next steps. A final (extra) seminar / meeting is being planned to discuss the next steps, the Final Report and the group's dissemination strategy.

The basic question has been what do we need to know and do that will lead to better policy, practice and applied research in relation to cancer survivorship and work engagement? As suspected, the discussions held so far have revealed much good practice among the different stake-holder groups but have also identified a number of significant short comings in the general area. The main interim finding is that there is no overall set of processes for guiding and supporting those with cancer in relation to work and their working lives; one that is known, shared and widely used in Britain within and across stake-holder groups. This lack of such a system affects not only those with cancer but also fails to inform and support their healthcare professionals and employing organisations. There are many reasons that might account for the rather fragmented state of affairs that exists including the lack of communication within and between stake-holder groups and the lack of awareness and sharing of what is known of relevance. Possibly, there are three factors involved here: a lack of awareness or even denial of the importance of work engagement to those with cancer, a lack of knowledge of the roles that others can play in helping to provide better guidance and support, and concerns about the limits of one's professional responsibility and competence. Some of these issues are now being picked up in research on cancer survivorship and work engagement in Europe and North America but there needs to be more translation of findings into action; better national policies and local practices and a much better integration of such local practices. This point has been developed further in the section focused on impact (so far). Two other issues were mentioned there. The first is a need to build a new network that is focussed, not solely on research, but on its translation into practice or policy or systems design. This network should bring together those that are active in these areas. The second is focused on those beginning a career in this overall area and their need for advice, mentoring and work opportunities. These interim findings are tentative and may be developed further or differently as the Discussion series progresses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Discussion seminars, with their multi-disciplinary and multi-professional audiences, have proved both informative and lively and have stimulated much useful debate. 

In addition to offering the seminars, it was proposed to develop a network of those interested and involved in the seminars and the issue of cancer and employment with a particular focus on younger and more isolated colleagues. 

The three areas for future development have been identified in the earlier sections: network development, the development of those early in their careers, and the design and implementation of a new system for delivering practical evidence-based information and advice on cancer and employment for all So far, an email list of over 100 interested persons has been established and this is being used as the basis of the proposed network. The aim of the network is to encourage, mentor and support those involved in issues relating to cancer and employment who are interested in embracing a multi-disciplinary and multi-professional approach.

It was also proposed to develop a website / portal to support the developing network and to provide a platform for engaging its members. A prototype has been developed and is being hosted at the University of Aberdeen. It is ready for trial. This website will be linked to that of CSWL at Birkbeck as the first step in building a web of web sites.

The Development seminars are considering how best to take the project forward and have concluded that the dissemination of the seminar findings and supporting knowledge is key to continuing this discussion. Two types of activity are planned: first formal publication - an edited text close based on the seminar series (under discussion with Springer-Palgrave) and a special number on key research issues in a relevant journal (being identified), and, second, a programme of more informal and local discussions based on the Caf&amp;eacute;Med and Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique models.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0040FD8C-E10F-4E04-A755-BBA693481DF4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df35265b6c74.22773442</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbk.ac.uk/cswl</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professional Doctorate in Occupational Health Psychology: Managing Long Term Illness at Work (Module): Birkbeck University of London</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>24682A4B-C026-441A-8F98-6D3F62C99D7F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f98a0fffc9.48090140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The proposed system focuses on the provision of evidence-based advice and support for those involved in issues relating to cancer survivorship and work engagement.

It seeks to provide evidence-based information, supporting understanding and advice giving, and related learning. It is intended not only for patients (and their friends and families) but also for the professionals involved in their health and social care and for employers. It will provide a local network map of those qualified and/or appropriate as providers of information, advice, care and support. However, it will also provide a vehicle for the development of a Community of Expertise to share information and learning. Finally, it will allow a potentially transportable record of involvement for all those who are involved.
