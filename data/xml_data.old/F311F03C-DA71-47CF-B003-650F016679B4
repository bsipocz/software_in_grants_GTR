Education and housing market decisions are among the most important that are made by households, who are able to exercise varying levels of autonomy, and deploy varying levels of resource. In most cases, households have to trade off aspects of housing and schooling in the decisions they make. National and local policy on education and also transport and spatial planning (e.g. the location of new housing) have the capacity to influence these decisions and their impacts in fundamental ways. Local policy decisions about housing location, schools provision, and admissions criteria can have significant impacts on householders' mobility decisions and the life chances of children. 

The main users of the research in the short and medium term will be local and national policy users. Specifically, these include those with responsibility for policies that affect school infrastructure and allocations policies; planning for new housing and transport; urban design; and social cohesion. Policy users at the local and national level have identified the research need, have been engaged in the design of the proposal and will continue to be involved throughout the project through the specification and refinement of interim and final outputs. 

Over the long term it is intended that an improved understanding of the relationship between local housing and education markets, and of the effect of planning and education policies on them, will lead to decisions that reduce congestion and social inequalities and enhance life chances and environmental quality. Over the longer term (e.g. through new policy implementation and as changes in household behaviour begin to 'bite') these will contribute to beneficial impacts for a wide range of groups, including:

- families with school-age children (reduced travel costs; better educational outcomes)
- schoolchildren (more active lifestyles; better health; better educational outcomes)
- local businesses (less road network congestion)
- general residents (less environmental degradation)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144777</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sheffield City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Sheffield City Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>FEE699CC-956B-4807-ADAF-73E5371A9EA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation of Sheffield City Council staff in three advisory panel meetings.

It is likely too early to gauge whether the project will have a substantive impact on policy or practice, although, on balance, the project is likely to have more of an impact in terms of raising awareness in the public sphere than it will in terms of direct policy change (this will be kept under ongoing review). As noted in the Key Findings, two key members of the project's research user community significantly changed their focus of policy attention during the course of the project which meant that the project findings became of less direct relevance to their immediate challenges. It is clear, however, that the research keyed into a topical concern within the region (see media reports, below) which saw the issues it raised gain significant political traction.

The project aimed to widen awareness both of the substantive issues addressed by the project and their relevance to society and to individual decision making; and of social science research generally (including that funded by ESRC specifically). 

The key impact mechanisms were:

A series of public engagement activities, including:
- The University of Sheffield's 'Mobile University' initiative which aims to bring bite-size lectures on cutting-edge research topics to a general public audience within key city centre locations (https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mobileuni). 
- Engagement with 14-16 year old school pupils through a University of Sheffield Urban Studies 'Taster Day' aimed at widening recognition about Higher Education and its research among pupils from local schools.

Local and national media, including:
- Double page feature interview in Sheffield Star (average readership 105,498), with online article on Sheffield Star website (average website hits 150,000 per day). Retweets to 73,600 followers of the Sheffield Star Twitter feed.
- Feature interview on BBC Radio Sheffield (276,000 listeners [ RAJAR Nov 2014])
- Front page headline article in Sheffield Telegraph (total reported issue readership 64,093), together with accompanying online article (http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/news/education/rich-suburb-primaries-at-top-of-class-for-quality-1-6951054)

The key findings arising from the project are:

- There are key socioeconomic determinants of school travel distance and mode. Less than half of school children in the case study city travelled to their nearest appropriate school.

- Children's choice of mode of travel cannot be explained solely by distance travelled to school. The socioeconomic background of the child, as measured through a range of individual and neighbourhood characteristics, plays an important role in explaining how children get to school as well as which schools they attend.

- Children from more deprived backgrounds face non-trivial transport hurdles if they wish to access 'better' schools, in the form of significantly increased travel distances and lesser potential to use active forms of travel.

- The promotion of school choice over several decades can be seen to have contributed to a variegated pattern of access to school and travel patterns. The hypothesis of 'choice by mortgage', in which parental strategies for school admissions centre on residential mobility and house purchase decisions, is partly borne out in that children attending the 'best' schools disproportionately live locally to them.

- The 'porosity' of school catchment areas varies by school type and performance (e.g. Key Stage results). Most neighbourhoods are in practice served by a complex set of overlapping 'de facto' catchments. There is a correlation between average neighbourhood house prices and the number of overlapping catchments for the 'best' schools. Residents living in neighbourhoods with higher than average measures of socioeconomic status among their residents have a larger number of 'better' schools to choose from. This agglomeration of 'good' schools is likely to better explain socioeconomic polarisation of neighbourhoods within cities over the long term than simple reference to singular 'good' schools.

- Models of the influence of education provision on the housing market do not take sufficiently account of the complex pattern of school attendance and the generally 'loose' spatial relation between school and home. The fact that the majority of children do not attend their nearest school, and that spatial patterns have a clear socioeconomic basis, have implications for hedonic models of the housing market as well as the construction of measures of deprivation at the small area level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings and the key modelling infrastructure that we developed (namely, network models of motorised and active transport infrastructure in Sheffield, together with documented methods; and a multi level model of transport choice) remain available for further development within academia or by the public sector.

Should a local education authority wish to consider carefully the spatial and travel impacts of changes to school provision or, our model provides a useful (and demonstrably feasible) starting point.

We have also developed a refined technique -- drawing on established literature -- for defining the 'de facto' catchment areas of schools based on individual level data on school attendance as well as travel costs/distance.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9F237A9D-464A-4313-A86D-933818A0D34F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5450dbcee18f99.23240813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.traveltoschoolproject.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This data deposit contains the following elements: 1. DfE data on Sheffield's primary and Secondary schools for the four years from 2007-8 to 2010-11. This data includes: pupil rates (FSM, BME, SEN etc), Key Stage results for the school + English national average. Faith status of school. 2. Core 2011 census socioeconomic variables at the output area level, a tailor-made house-price index for Sheffield (constructed using Land Registry data) and several urban form variables for Sheffield (residential, cul-de-sac, junction density etc) using which a geodemographic cluster analysis for Sheffield was undertaken. 3. Shapefiles of de facto primary and secondary school catchment areas based on the core 65% of pupil intake for 2010-11 (please also see metadata notes within the shapefiles in GIS). 4. Shapefiles of the 7-category geodemographic cluster analysis created for Sheffield using the above dataset and k-means cluster analysis after Vickers (2006). The dasymmetric file shows the clusters overlaid upon a layer of residential density for Sheffield. NB It was not possible to share the core pupil database used for analysis as this was owned by Sheffield City Council and contains confidential pupil data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5AB2CB7-4687-45EA-AC21-EB45AE3F02DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dataset has been uploaded into the UK Data Archive &amp;quot;ReShare&amp;quot; repository and is currently awaiting review, virus-checking etc.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e4d2195ead5.08519665</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sheffield Travel to School Data 2007-2011</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/cgi/users/home?screen=EPrint%3A%3AView&amp;eprintid=851550</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0706FADE-A847-40C5-A706-6E885FB7BE24</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children's Travel to School - the interaction of individual, neighbourhood and school factors</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff64659eaf9dde6f260e73fcf1c7d30b"><gtr:id>ff64659eaf9dde6f260e73fcf1c7d30b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Easton, S.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>544e2a90a334d0.17088141</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F1FF2EBA-A997-4DC6-B6C0-A3A32061454A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children's travel to school-the interaction of individual, neighbourhood and school factors</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transport Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/633c2b11029efe0d1940f55bac814954"><gtr:id>633c2b11029efe0d1940f55bac814954</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Easton S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56742831bad618.70938994</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9056C7D3-1B8D-497E-8BD4-85058EB56135</gtr:id><gtr:title>An exploration of the relationship between neighbourhoods, housing and primary school catchment areas in Sheffield, England</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff64659eaf9dde6f260e73fcf1c7d30b"><gtr:id>ff64659eaf9dde6f260e73fcf1c7d30b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Easton, S.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>543cf62ce6c810.38660832</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F27DC643-BB4F-425D-9871-FFB632FCD454</gtr:id><gtr:title>Featured graphic.
