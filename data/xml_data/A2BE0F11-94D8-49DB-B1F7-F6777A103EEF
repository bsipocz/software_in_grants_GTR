The Town Pound. Local currencies build local economic resilience by keeping more money circulating locally, helping to stimulate cross community connections and encouraging people to think about how they spend their money. 

We aim to create a locally branded currency on each high street that will act as a strong marketing and loyalty tool for local shops and services, making it easier for customers to fulfil their desire to buy local. We are also developing the ability to track individual units of currency to capture intelligence around how money is being used in a particular area. Crucially, this data could be used to identify new market opportunities. 

The Town Pound team will create a suite of products based on local currency concepts that offer additional benefits for high street traders: one stop online shop for each high street; click and collect service bringing people into high streets; collective loyalty schemes; business networking and brokering; granular retail management data. The currency will be in electronic form allowing consumers and traders to send and receive payments by the method most convenient to them, via mobile phone text message, Smartphone app, or online. Since consumer needs cannot be fulfilled entirely by local businesses, it will be possible to exchange the different currencies throughout the network of participating towns and cities across the country, making it the first and only UK National-Local Currency. 

We are proposing a complimentary currency that is designed to work alongside sterling, not replace it. Each town pound will be backed pound for pound by sterling deposits. Consumers will be able to use a local currency/online ordering/collection or delivery services from shops which may otherwise be unable to offer these services independently. We will also supply a business directory for users to find products and services, and a brokering service to actively encourage businesses to use each other. A loyalty programme to encourage repeat use of the scheme could be built in and there is scope to create special offers to encourage particular modes of purchasing.

In summary, our proposed solution will:
? Help identify flows of money and possible enterprise opportunities in the community.
? Offer a convenient way for customers to re-engage with their high street businesses and shop more locally.
? Capitalise on the pride that citizens may have in their locality.
? Offer added value to high street retailers. 
? Support the networked High Street, not just the shops but the supporting services as well.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971407</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
