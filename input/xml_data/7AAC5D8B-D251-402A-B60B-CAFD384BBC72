The strength and variability of this circulation is thought to have significant consequences for the climate of northern Europe. Important exit pathways for the cold, dense bottom water are found all along the topographic barrier presented by the Greenland Scotland Ridge - the eastern section of which (between Iceland and Scotland) carries about one third of the total overflow transport into the N Atlantic. The proposed modelling project will focus on the portion of the overflow that is diverted over the Wyville-Thomson Ridge (WTR)and eventually into the Rockall Trough. The climatic importance of this branch of the overflow is already recognised by the establishment by NERC of a field monitoring programme at the site. Sets of mathematical and laboratory models will be developed to support the monitoring activity, in order to understand the processes responsible for the leakage of flow over the WTR and the pathways taken by the overflow as it crosses the WTR and finds its way to the Rockall Trough. Furthermore, the models will quantify the relative fluxes of dense bottom water overflows at different sections of the ridge under different external conditions and will explore the conditions under which the overflow is episodic in nature. The topographic control on the coupling between (i) the overflow leakage over the ridge and (ii) the main overflow transport in the adjacent Wyville Thomson Basin is of crucial importance for the resolution of the above matters and this will receive special attention in the modelling studies. The processes responsible for variability in the Wyville Thomson Ridge overflow will be delineated and the mixing associated with the final cascading descent of bottom water into the Rockall Trough will be measured for a wide range of conditions. The models will vary in domain size, from the regional scale, in which the overflow characteristics of a large part of the Faroese Channels system will be simulated, to the small scale where the detailed structure of the cascading flow and its mixing with the overlying warmer waters will be studied. An important aspect of the research is the interplay between the modelling investigations and the field data, with the predictions of the former informing the analysis of the latter and the future development of the monitoring operations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136843</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main achievements and outcomes of the project related to numerical modelling were obtained in the framework of a series of numerical experiments organized in such a way to address all basic questions formulated as the project objectives. They are as follows: 
? to describe the spatial structure and temporal variability of the deep water circulation in the Faroese channels;
? to clarify the roles of eddy formation and eddy advection in determining the spatial and temporal variability of the WTR overflow;
? to understand the role played by mixing processes in the dynamics of the WTR overflow to the Rockall Trough via the Ellett Gully; 
? to quantify the WTR overflow in terms of all basic input parameters such as temperature and salinity, intensity of deep-water circulation, background mixing etc. 
No previous modelling investigations have been made on these aspects of the overflow dynamics, so it was required to conduct a large number of experiments with an accurate validation of the model output against available observational data. Three sets of numerical experiments were conducted.

Large-scale regional numerical modelling. Modelling of the deep-water circulation in the whole area of the Faroese Channels was carried out in this series. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the structure of the deep water circulation in the area, to explore eddy formation and to quantify the major routes of overflow spreading. Particular attention was paid to the clarification of the sensitivity of the deep-water dynamics to the variability of the basic parameters. 
The model was forced by the removal of a barrier that separates different water masses in the bottom layer of the Faroe-Shetland Channel at the north-eastern boundary. An analysis of the output reveals that during its adjustment in the rotating channel the propagating flow is unstable and forms cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies in the Faroese Channels. The life-time of the cyclonic eddy is about 10 days, but an anti-cyclonic eddy that is formed upstream of the sill crest of the Faroe Bank Channel has a longer life-time. However after 50 days it eventually loses its structure below 400 m due to the decay of a counter-rotating current. In the upper 400 m layer this anti-cyclonic eddy remains persistent for longer. Observational evidence of the eddy is confirmed by the tracks of experimental drifters released in the area and by the temperature and salinity fields observed in the Faroese Channels. 
The pinching of isotherms along the Wyville Thomson Ridge results in the concentration of cold water on the southern side of Faroese Channels that overflows into the Rockall Trough. The model results demonstrate that the main part of the cold water outflows through the Faroe Bank Channel, rather than across the Wyville Thompson Ridge, due to Earth rotation. The apparent similarity of modelled temperature, salinity and velocity sections to recent measurements in this area adds confidence to these results.
The results on the large-scale modelling are included in the paper by Stashchuk N., V. Vlasenko, and T.J. Sherwin &amp;quot;Numerical investigation of deep water circulation in the Faroes Channel&amp;quot; accepted for publication in &amp;quot;Deep-Sea Research I&amp;quot; and were reported at International Conference JONSMOD-2010 in Delft (Netherlands) in May 2010, and at 2nd Marine Institute Research Centre Conference, at Plymouth in May 2011.
Ellett Gully outflow. Numerical experiments were conducted on a restricted area of the Faroese Channels in order to describe the outflow through the Ellett Gulley into the Cirolana Deep and to compare the model predictions with the results of the in-situ observations of a large overflow event captured by CTD survey and ADCP measurements performed in Spring 2003 in this area. A &amp;quot;truncated&amp;quot; numerical experiment was performed with the Ellett Gully overflow model domain to investigate and quantify the mixing processes associated with the cascading descent of overflow water down the gully. Over a period of only seven days in April 2003 bottom water temperatures cooled dramatically, from 4.46?C to 3.03?C in the CD and from 3.93 to 2.54?C in the Ymir Trough (YT). 
Model predicted temperature, salinity, and velocity profiles, along with total water transport, were compared to those derived from CTD surveys. It was shown that the three-dimensional simulations were consistent with the observed cooling. It was found as well that the descending gravity current constrained by the lateral flanks of Ellett Gully forms at the exit to CD a pair of eddies with cyclonic and anticyclonic vorticity. 
Analysis of mixing processes produced by the gravity current was conducted using a passive tracer evolution equation. It was shown that the water mixing in the modelled downstream propagated bottom flow is characterized by an explosive detrainment regime in the CD. An analysis of sensitivity runs revealed that the final depth to which the overflow descends depends on the initial upstream velocity of the overflow, as well as the buoyancy difference.
It is argued that models of overflows need to have realistic representations of the density structure of the overflow, and sufficiently fine vertical resolution, for the subsequent fate of the overflow to be accurately represented. 
The results from this series of experiments were published in the paper Stashchuk N., V. Vlasenko, and T.J. Sherwin (2010) &amp;quot;Insight into the structure of the Wyville Thomson Ridge overflow current from a fine-scale numerical modelling&amp;quot;. Deep-Sea Research I, doi:10.1016/j.dsr.2010.06.006, and reported at three following conferences: AGU Annual meeting in Toronto (Canada) in May 2009, at OCEAN-2025 annual meeting in Liverpool in June 2009, and at International Conference JONSMOD-2010 in Delft (Netherlands) in May 2010.
Numerical modelling for laboratory-scale flows. The laboratory model experiments were simulated numerically using the same values of the dimensional parameters as in the laboratory runs. A small-scale spatial grid in this series of numerical experiments was used. An initial condition was take similar to the laboratory experiment: the lock located at the side wall of the calculation domain separating two different water bodies with prescribed temperature and salinity distributions was removed at t=0. After opening the lock, the evolution of the flow with elapsed time was computed to establish the fully-developed stationary circulation and mixing properties between the two water bodies. A comparative analysis of the model output against the laboratory data set is conducting at the moment with their further synthesis and summarization in a research paper.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The principal beneficiaries of the research will be oceanographic and climate researchers and will include not only the participants in the NERC strategic marine science programme Oceans 2025 but also the wider European community. Their interest is evidenced by the letters of support from two leading European scientists, Professor Jarle Berntsen from Bergen University (who has pioneered and developed the Bergen Ocean Model for shelf and overflow problems) and Professor Detlef Quadfasel from Hamburg University (who is heading a major EU FP7 integrated project proposal, THOR, to model and measure exchange across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge). The proposed modelling investigation will directly complement and add to these research programmes and help secure a better understanding of the processes that control the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation which is so important to the climate of northern Europe and the Arctic. 

A unique part of the global ocean circulation system has been chosen for the proposed studies. It presents a number of fascinating challenges in terms of how to monitor deep ocean currents and interpret in situ observations in regions of large irregular topography and the development of model investigations of large ocean cascades. The proposed model studies will (i) improve predictability by enhancing the interpretation of the monitoring data and providing a theoretical framework within which to analyse these data, (ii) guide the future development of the Wyville Thomson Ridge monitoring programme by identifying the key instrument locations and deployments required to optimise the monitoring activity, and (iii) provide better understanding of the processes that control North Atlantic circulation that will help geophysicists and paeleo-oceanographers interpret sedimentary records. 

In more general terms, the proposed research will (a) contribute to the protection of future human and environmental health by providing parametric information for use by global climate monitoring and modelling organisations (both academic and governmental) and (b) advance the disciplines of fluid dynamics and and oceanography by providing the academic research community with solutions to a set of challenging fundamental problems in these fields.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>57EA5BF3-A12E-4BA4-A4FD-4F5D607F35B3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e04cb597d420.14394543</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>173E60A6-42FA-4502-8938-33F3E95776AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Numerical investigation of deep water circulation in the Faroese Channels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/30903192cf95181349185c133466ce22"><gtr:id>30903192cf95181349185c133466ce22</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stashchuk N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56da9bf8e9a5e9.92130001</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FF0D8A0-9F5B-44C1-9BF5-E0FE7FA643BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Seismic imaging, modelling and observations of the Wyville Thomson Ridge dense water overflow</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dcec6186eb41cf7e9c3648de951b6aee"><gtr:id>dcec6186eb41cf7e9c3648de951b6aee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Polton J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae1824fd1d6.77632122</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>775C2174-C4D7-47A5-A9A5-72A9B4A9656E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Model studies of dense water overflows in the Faroese Channels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ocean Dynamics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/16a4bc5d94bcea0fd9a801c5da4704e9"><gtr:id>16a4bc5d94bcea0fd9a801c5da4704e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cuthbertson A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56daa0cdb75559.45387347</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E199C085-7232-48F1-98CC-C38C0A262718</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigation into deep-water circulation in the Faroese Channel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ec5b6d509c3e87651b0f690553df516d"><gtr:id>ec5b6d509c3e87651b0f690553df516d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vlasenko V.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae207bcbae7.24134877</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>379EDEA8-EFF5-4838-8968-82DF668C79D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling of the Wyville Thomson ridge overflow</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/810135ff1503d28a33bfec6ba0ac5b4e"><gtr:id>810135ff1503d28a33bfec6ba0ac5b4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davies P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae52c623474.79406081</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A544025-8978-44F0-A7AE-A401D8DF6A00</gtr:id><gtr:title>Insights into the structure of the Wyville Thomson Ridge overflow current from a fine-scale numerical model</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/30903192cf95181349185c133466ce22"><gtr:id>30903192cf95181349185c133466ce22</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stashchuk N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae3f1134fc6.26985499</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09C0799A-587E-417A-8A1C-73F888031061</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modeling of the Wyville Thomson ridge overflow</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a22889ad933e8876448810c55fd037b"><gtr:id>2a22889ad933e8876448810c55fd037b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stashchuk N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae5b2a35547.89717523</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/F012403/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp;
