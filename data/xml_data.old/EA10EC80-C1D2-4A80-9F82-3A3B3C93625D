Er81</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I021833/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the developing cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons are generated in the germinal zones and migrate into the developing cortical plate, with the earliest generated occupying the deepest layers, and the last generated the more superficial layers. Within the germinal zones the type of pyramidal neuron generated is controlled by differential regulation of gene expression, some of which have been identified. We do not yet know how expression of particular genes leads to particular patterns of axon outgrowth, target selection, or physiological properties. Er81 is expressed at early stages of cortical development in the ventricular zone in dividing cells and then later in post-mitotic L5 neurons in the cortical plate. In both Pax6 mutants and Ngn2 mutants the expression of Er81 is disrupted, implying Er81 is regulated by both of these genes. This suggests an early role for Er81 in neuronal differentiation and cortical lamination/migration, similar to its role in olfactory bulb development. At later stages, most L5 Er81 expressing neurons also express Ctip2 but not Otx1. Ctip2 controls the formation of corticospinal axon outgrowth, whilst Otx1 controls outgrowth of collicular/pontine projections. Whilst some studies have shown ER81 to be down-stream of Ctip2, our preliminary microarray and qPCR data show that Er81 controls Ctip2, which is confirmed by the up-regulation of Ctip2 seen in the Er81 KO. Loss of Ctip2 results in a loss of CST axons, whilst reduced expression results in mis-specification of cortical pyramidal neurons, suggesting that Ctip2 and Er81 control the processes of axonal specification and collateral withdrawal of L5 projections. Outside the cortex, Er81 is expressed specifically in target nuclei of L5 neurons, such as the superior colliculus and inferior olive, offering an exciting avenue for investigation of specification of cortical connectivity. A similar role has been shown for Er81 in formation of circuitry in the spinal cord where ER81 is expressed by specific motor and sensory neurons and there are defects in the formation of these interconnections in mutants. Er81 and Ctip2 are both regulated by Fezf2. In Fezf2 mutants there is a mis-specification of the L5 Ctip2 expressing cells, which instead express Tbr1 and Satb2, migrate to L6 and send axons through the anterior commissure/corpus callosum. Satb2 is expressed in L5 callosal projection neurons and represses the expression of Ctip2. In the Er81 KO mouse we showed an increase in the number of Ctip2-expressing neurons with callosal projections suggesting that Er81 controls Ctip2 by suppressing Satb2. Er81 can be seen to play a central role in the establishment of cortical connectivity. In the last few years our understanding of the molecular control of cortical neuronal specification has improved and we have produced some very exciting preliminary data underpinning the proposed experiments. Whilst this complex network of genes regulates the development of particular pyramidal cells, we have very little idea about how changes in these networks allow for specific regional connectivity which is a fundamental process of brain wiring. As clinically related studies of brain development identify new gene associations with developmental disorders that result in altered brain function, it is essential to understand the details of the normal transcriptional networks. Whist it is perhaps premature to suggest that knowledge of how specific genes influence cortical wiring could enable future therapies, this will be essential if we are ever to use cell based therapies in brain repair. Current research has focused almost exclusively on the generation of identifiable neuronal cell classes from both innate and experimentally induced stem cells, no understanding of how such cells might be controlled in terms of their connectivity has yet been made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Characterisation of L5 Er81 neurons Using the Er81-GFP mouse the expression pattern of Er81 during the developmental stages of neuronal genesis and migration, dendritic elaboration, axonal outgrowth, and refinement of connections will be described. This will corroborate previous studies but also allow the correlation of Er81 expression with other L5 marker genes, using in situ hybridisation (ISH) and immuno-histochemistry (IHC). Combining these studies with axon tracing, (viral eGFP will optimise details of cell morphology), we will characterise the different molecular subclasses of pyramidal cells with axonal projection targets. Role of Er81 in the transcriptional network Using microarrays on Er81 KO mice cortex at specific stages of development, we will look for genes regulated by Er81. Er81 linked genes in cortex will be compared with those previously identified in DRGs by our collaborator Silvia Arber. These target genes will be validated by ISH, qPCR and IHC. Using slice cultures candidate genes will be screened to show linked changes in expression following Er81 over-expression or knockdown. Further analysis will be made using ChIP-seq to discover Er81 interacting partners. Using ChIP-PCR the link between Er81 and Ctip2 and other candidate genes, such as the recently identified L5 gene Tshz2. For Tshz2 we can further characterise L5 neurons in Tshz2-GFP and Tshz2 KO mice. Role of Er81 in L5 neuron identity Using the Er81-LacZ KO mice, the expression of Er81 target genes, and the changes in dendritic morphology/axonal projections of null-Er81 cells will be determined. Er81 will be locally over-expressed in cortex using in utero electroporation and changes in pyramidal cell connectivity, somatodendritic morphology and gene expression will be detailed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research addresses fundamental questions about normal brain development. There are several important levels at which this work will be of major benefit in the short and long term. Recently our understanding of CNS development has improved dramatically, in particular molecular techniques and the ability to manipulate genes has revolutionized our understanding of the controls of brain development. At a scientific level, no one would doubt the fascination in understanding how the brain develops, in particular how the myriad of different neurons classes are generated in specific places and ratios and then link in a highly specific fashion to form the amazing connectivity which underpins brain function. Our experience of discussion with scientific and clinical colleagues, students and school children, and with lay audiences testifies to the widespread interest in this area of research. A deeper and intriguing aspect of this research is how changes in these regulatory patterns must underpin subtle changes in circuit formation, which form the basis of all differences in personality, intelligence, and performance. Whilst the brains of all species are remarkably similar at a gross level, the subtle changes in development of the precise patterns of circuitry underpin individual differences. In man this accounts for the different abilities of the mathematical, genius, the concert pianist or professional sportsman, and even world leaders. Tentative steps towards an understanding of the development of the brain and how this accounts for such differences are clearly of huge public interest. The subtle changes in the process of brain wiring which generate positive differences in abilities can also have tragic negative outcomes. With the advent of new molecular techniques and clinical screening programmes, many candidate genes and genomic interactions have been identified which are linked to brain abnormalities. In some cases these are severe malformations, resulting in major functional impairment, whilst in others they are subtle changes which affect only certain functions, such as dyslexia. As candidate genes are identified, finding out how they fit into the regulatory networks, such as those highlighted in this proposal, will be the obvious progression. This will certainly be of interest to clinicians, who diagnose and define the potential outcomes associated with such abnormalities. Patients and patient groups will naturally have a keen interest in understanding such conditions. Indeed the specific charities and support groups commonly focus on such research as the key to understanding the nature of the disability and the implications for sufferers. Commercial concerns will also be interested in the development of diagnostics and in the longer term for therapies. Increased longevity and concomitant increase in the number of patients diagnosed with CNS degenerative diseases, is a major global health problem. Stem cell research is currently one of the best hopes for curing such disorders. The ability to harness innate stem cells from the brain, or from elsewhere in the body, to generate neurons is a key strategy for the potential repair of CNS disorders. Similarly the use of embryonic of other donor stem cells to form specific neuronal subtypes is a major area of translational research. In stroke or CNS injury the promotion of regeneration and plasticity, or generation of new neurons from intrinsic stem cells, is key to functional repair. Unless we understand the normal controls on neuronal development and in particular connectivity, it is unclear how any realistic therapy could be achieved. Indeed mis-wiring the CNS from grafted or regenerating neurons could have even more problematic consequences. This work will inform the vast field of basic and clinically related research in this area and again be of enormous interest to patient groups, funding agencies and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>642625</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Lizzie Burns (https://history.medsci.ox.ac.uk/art/dr-lizzie-burns/) featured in Cortex Club (http://cortexclub.com/about/).</gtr:description><gtr:id>93BAE436-E39D-4920-8B62-4D9289D3BCEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The modelling session made the participants to think about brain anatomy, more global issues of neuroscience, while creating artwork (https://history.medsci.ox.ac.uk/art/dr-lizzie-burns/).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc9d61882ce6.37361194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Joint Cortex Club Session on Brain Modelling with Dr Lizzie Burns</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://history.medsci.ox.ac.uk/art/activities/brain-portraits/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>https://history.medsci.ox.ac.uk/art/activities/brain-portraits/A resource for teaching

Data was RMA normalized and putatively differential gene expression (&amp;gt;1.5-fold higher in subplate, nominal p&amp;lt;0.05) determined. High-throughput sequencing data was used to identify genes expressed at a higher level (&amp;gt;1.5 fold) in the adult mouse subplate/layer 6b compared to the adjacent layer 6a. In total, 1642 genes were identified as potentially SP enriched at least at one age. Of these, 426 genes could be confirmed as SP enriched using published or publicly available databases including Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Adult), Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (E15.5, E18.5, P4 and P14), Genepaint.org (E14.5, P7 and Adult) and or our own in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry experiments. The schematic results of this are presented here in the &amp;quot;Subplate Gene Expression Atlas&amp;quot;. Genes with uniform or no labelling, or for which no images could be found, were not included.

Using the above approach, we selected against genes that are subplate expressed, but are additionally expressed in layer 6a at equal or higher levels. Furthermore, there may be subplate specific or enriched genes not identified by the microarrays. Thus, genes important for the differentiation of the deep cortical layers or those relevant in the specification of subplate prior to E15.5 may not be included here.

This Subplate Gene Expression Atlas is an ongoing project and over time more genes identified by other sources may be added if there is convincing evidence of their subplate enriched expression at the above time points.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Subplate Gene Expression Atlas illustrates the cortical expression patterns of 426 selected genes.

The expression patterns illustrated in the Atlas are derived from published or publicly available in situ hybridization images.

The detailed transcriptional underpinnings of brain development and neuropsychiatric disease are poorly understood, particularly in humans and closely related primate model organisms. To fill this gap, we describe a comprehensive spatiotemporal transcriptional atlas of rhesus monkey brain development that combines dense pre- and postnatal temporal coverage with fine anatomical parcellation of cortical and subcortical regions associated with human neurological and psychiatric disease. Using these data, we show high rates of expression change throughout prenatal and early postnatal development that taper off sharply during childhood, which are of comparable magnitude in both dividing precursors and maturing postmitotic neurons. Prenatal patterning varies dramatically from postnatal stages, while acquisition of adult-like molecular profiles for cortical layers and areas occurs gradually but surprisingly late in postnatal life. Different cell populations show discrete but overlapping expression profiles and show evidence for differences in developmental timing but also an unexpected degree of synchrony of specific developmental processes. Comparing rhesus gene expression trajectories to human, rat and mouse reveals large-scale differences between primates and rodents and a number of genes with human-specific temporal patterning. This transcriptional map, along with corresponding neuroimaging reference and cellular resolution gene expression data, provide a rich, freely accessible resource for understanding spatiotemporal transcriptional dynamics of primate and human brain development.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>I helped with the new edition of the brain part of the Kaufman's Atlas of Mouse Development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DD2F911-342D-4A77-99E2-0AD6F138C253</gtr:id><gtr:impact>https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=U-GcBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA239&amp;amp;ots=rC3BP_nnya&amp;amp;sig=dq96eq2DhH-R89_Zbo2O29gICGM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc91b81f72b7.40839412-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Brain Development

Description
This chapter is divided into several sections that follow the chronological development of the 
mammalian brain (Goffinet and Rakic, 2000). It starts with a discussion of the specification of 
future neural tissue and the early types of signaling that contribute to the regionalization of 
the central nervous system (CNS)(E5-E12). Then, focusing mainly on the cerebral cortex, 
the text describes in detail how different cell types are generated and sets out some general 
principles underlying the layered structure of the mature neocortex (E12-P8). The mature ...

Genes connected to the two disorders may only be active for a brief window of time.
The study, while in mice, could provide clues about how the developmental disorders develop. Focusing on a region of the brain known as the subplate, where the first nerve cells develop, researchers at the University of Oxford, King's College London and Imperial College London found that genes linked to autism and schizophrenia were only active in these regions during early stages of brain development.

Neurons in the subplate region form the foundation for the network of neural connections that eventually crisscross the brain. Studying the way that nerves develop and join this network can reveal where the growth can go wrong and trigger diseases such as autism or schizophrenia.

I regularly advise journalists on publications related to autism and schizophrenia and on general issues on brain development.

A collaborative study between the groups of Professor Juan De Carlos (Instituto Cajal, C.S.I.C., Madrid, Spain) and Professor Zolt&amp;aacute;n Moln&amp;aacute;r (Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford UK) has provided evidence for a new source of the earliest generated cerebral cortical cells, the subplate. In their recent publication in the journal Proceeding of the National Academy of Science USA (Pedraza et al., 2014) they describe that a considerable proportion of these early generated cells (known as the subplate) originate from an unusual and unexpected source, in the anterior and medial part of the telencephalon, outside the cerebral cortex itself. Previously, it had been generally accepted that they originate locally from the germinal zone of the cortical neuroepithelium. 

These subplate cells in the embryonic cerebral cortex are particularly interesting for clinicians concerned with brain developmental abnormalities, since they provide a transient scaffold for the developing cerebral cortex and assist in the development of cortical connectivity, effectively providing the foundation of the adult structure. Indeed, the first synaptic contact in the cerebral cortex is established between subplate cells and the first thalamic fibers that reach the neuroepithelium. Disruption or damage to these early cells could be the source of flaws that lead to cerebral cortical developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, schizophrenia and autism. The discoveries that these scaffold cells arrive after a longer and more arduous journey might be significant to understand developmental disorders, because the process of their migration could be vulnerable and could be the cause of some cortical developmental abnormalities. If the scaffold is not assembled in the right time at the right place, then other aspects of the building work of making a brain can suffer which may only manifest in later life. This makes the discovery of this unusual origin and migration of the subplate neurons important for the developmental neurobiology and clinical neurology community.

The team in Madrid, led by Professor De Carlos noticed that some subplate cells originate from an unusual anterior and medial location (rostral medial telencephalic wall) and migrate tangentially through long routes to the cerebral cortex. The team at Oxford studied a selective subgroup of subplate cells expressing Lpar1 (Edg2) which had similar distribution and characteristics to the labeled cells found by De Carlos and his team (Molecular diversity of early-born subplate neurons. Hoerder-Suabedissen A, Moln&amp;aacute;r Z. Cereb. Cortex. 2013 Jun;23(6):1473-83). When the two teams compared their results on a meeting they decided to use cell-tracker to label rostral medial telencephalic wall in the mouse strain with fluorescently labeled Lpar1-positive cells. These experiments showed a very good match and clearly demonstrated that indeed this subset of labeled subplate cells originated from this unexpected and unusual anterior-medial source in mice. 

The layer of subplate cells is in the Cerebral Cortex of all mammals, but their size varies between species, being wider in humans and primates. This suggests that subplate cells are not a vestige of early neuronal structures, but a fundamental structure involved in early stage of cortical development. For this reason it will be important to study this source also in humans and hence, it will be imperative to study abnormalities of this particular subplate cell population in human cognitive disorders. It has been previously found that many of the schizophrenia and autism associated genes were expressed transiently in subplate during development (Expression profiling of mouse subplate reveals a dynamic gene network and disease association with autism and schizophrenia. Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Feb 26;110(9):3555-60). Studying the way that nerves develop and connect this network can reveal where things can go wrong and trigger diseases such as the mentioned cerebral palsy, autism or schizophrenia.

On 14th January 2014 a mini Symposium organised by Andrew King and Zolt&amp;aacute;n Moln&amp;aacute;r served as the first joint cluster meeting between the systems and cellular neuroscience groups of the DPAG. The meeting covered a wide range of topics focussed around &amp;quot;Mammalian cerebral cortical circuits&amp;quot;.

The joint cluster meeting brought together groups who are experts in the field of cerebral cortical circuit formation and plasticity in mammals. Their expertise extends from neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the establishment and plasticity of connections. These groups use various techniques: laser-scanning photo stimulation, 2-photon microscopy, confocal microscopy, electrophysiology and behavioural testing. Their aim is to understand how mammalian cortical neurons control cortical development and plasticity and how they are integrated into functional cortical circuitry responsible for some of the most sophisticated sensory and motor processing.

The cluster meeting was linked to the visit of Professor Anne Mc Kinney, Vice Chair of McGill's Brain Institute, who delivered a keynote lecture on &amp;quot;Dendritic spines, autism and epilepsy&amp;quot;. Her laboratory has made a great contribution to the insights into synapse maintenance and plasticity in the mammalian cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

The symposium gave an excellent opportunity to continue to build links between McGill and Oxford Neuroscience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639ad2961077.60691168</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.mcgill.ca/brain/international-partners/oxford-university/oxford-neuroscience-news</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview to the OX Magazine on Brain Awareness Week 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E3D55FA-4617-41B7-9331-EA13F44B56D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From the 10th March the Museum of Natural History are opening an exhibition and series of events on the mysteries of neurological development - Brain Diaries.

Communication and engagement with the wider community 
This research addresses fundamental questions about normal brain development. There is a widely held fascination in understanding how the brain develops, in particular how the myriad of different neurons classes are generated in specific places and ratios and then link in a highly specific fashion to form the amazing network of connections which underpins brain function. There is now almost a daily item in the national press relating to work that forms the focus of this research. This highlights the importance society attaches to work in the field of brain science and in particular developmental disorders affecting human behaviour and function. 

Transfer of Knowledge to Future Generations 
Given the strong underlying relevance of this work to clinical science, it is essential that future clinicians are both aware and understand the research and its implications. Oxford is one of the highest ranked medical schools internationally and we are privileged to teach highly motivated medical students and to attract undergraduate researchers to help with project work related to this proposal. This exposure seeds the imagination of future generations of clinicians, many of whom will continue in clinical research fields with a high level and essential understanding of the complexities of CNS development. Further, both JT and ZM are deeply involved in the Internationally rated Graduate Training Programme in Neuroscience at Oxford, which has generated a world class group of alumni, many of whom are now leading Neuroscience researchers. It is this initial educational impact, which ensures the future exploitation and maximization of the impact of this research.

Academic and Commercial Impact
Our work will be published in leading open access scientific journals and present our findings at National and International meetings which is the conventional and established means of communication of the major findings of the research outlined in this programme. We will always seek to publish in highest impact journals thus ensuring the widest audience of researcher within the wider fields of Development and Neuroscience. Although we have no current plans for direct commercial exploitation of this work, public presentation and publication is the essential mechanism for generating interest in our work from Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical industries. We have requested the funding to ensure that this function of our scientific work is efficiently and optimally achieved. It is through such links that collaborations with clinicians, biotechnology companies and other researchers are fostered. If commercially exploitable finding are made, we will use the University ISIS innovations to ensure that this is maximised. 

Communication to Policy Makers and the Wider Public 
Both PIs are involved in communication of science to the wider community, through access and outreach programmes for Schools and through continuing education programmes. Significant findings will be publicised both in scientific journals and via Departmental and University WebPages and through these links, to the wider audience through the press. We will continue our work with the outreach programmes and seek to enhance our general public engagement. Both PIs also play important roles in the Development of Research strategy for the Medical Sciences Division in Oxford, and through this to the University and directly linking to both Government and charitable funding bodies.

Collaboration and coproduction 
Our impressive and enthusiastic collaborators attest to the wide interest and potential of this research project. We will endeavour to continue to build on these international collaborations through meetings and laboratory exchanges in which we will promote the training and transfer of knowledge. Indeed Dr Cheung has just returned from an extensive visit to a collaborator in Japan to learn the technique of intrauterine electroporation. In terms of active collaborations with clinical science ZM has a long standing link to clinical neurology and neuropathology and regularly presents his findings to a clinical audience. 

Exploitation and Application 
Oxford now has a Stem Cell research initiative and we intend to link to this programme and with the laboratories involved in neuronal stem cell work. A fundamental part of attempts to use cell based therapies to repair the CNS is to ensure that the connections formed by transplanted cells are appropriate and effectively restore function. Our deep understanding of this field and the knowledge generated from the work outlined in this proposal will be of essential interest to Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology companies in this area. Whilst we currently have no commercial exploitation plans, any finding that do have potential will be exploited through Oxford ISIS Innovations. JT has followed this route with ISIS Innovations based upon similar work on neuronal cell survival.

Capacity and involvement 
Both PIs undertake certain public engagement activities as outlined above. These include school visits, open days, science festivals, as well as academic conferences which enable us to both formally and informally disseminate our research. We will also use the University of Oxford Press Office to ensure maximum public impact of our notable research findings.
 
Impact ability, deliverables and milestones 
Whilst this work does not have immediate commercial goals, our hope is that the finding from this research will inform the wider scientific and specific biotechnology communities involved in brain development and repair. From previous experience, the progress from initial discussion of invention to engagement with potential commercial partners is within the time frame of this proposal. If such opportunities present we would hope that a five year period for commercial exploitation would be realistic.

Resource for the activity 
We do not seek additional funding for potential exploitation or specific avenues for communication, as our current activities and the normal plans for public engagement can be met within the outlined budget. Any resultant commercial exploitation or wider publicity would be provided by ISIS Innovation and the University Press Office without cost.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CAB7C8FF-D132-4EB2-B5EF-676815EECFD9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464b564d4d7d9.87160904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project set out three main aims.

1. Define the genesis, migration, dendritic and axonal development of the population of L5 Er81 neurons and correlate this morphology with differential gene expression.

2. Define the role of Er81 in the transcriptional network that regulates the development of a sub-population L5 pyramidal neurons

3. To establish the role of Er81 in the connectivity of L5 neurons.

We made progress in all three areas over the last 1-1.5 years and we shall soon be in a position to summarise the details in publications. The project is progressing according to the original plans, but these are still early days to provide comprehensive and final summaries for these questions.



1. Basic developmental studies of Er81 expression and characterisation of the L5 sub-population is progressing well and nearing completion. We are currently investigating the somatodendritic morphology of layer 5 neurons. The retrograde tracing and immunohistochemistry part of the project is completed for adult. 

2. The analysis of Er81 KO by immunohistochemistry has begun. We had difficulties to breed the Er81 KO colony, but now we have sufficient numbers to complete the study. We used viral tracing methods to dissect the circuits formed by Er81 positive layer 5 neurons and Er81 positive ventral horn motorneurons.

3. The molecular studies to elucidate the genes that are regulated by Er81 by over-expressing Er81 in the developing cortex in vitro has been completed and we also completed the microarray-based expression analysis. We completed the validation of selected candidate genes by qPCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. Similar analysis is ongoing of the KO mouse. Some of the ChIP-PCR studies are completed, but others are still ongoing. Validation of candidate genes will start this year. 

4. Identifying Er81 target genes is on-going, the investigation of the Tshz2 KO mouse started, but not completed. 

These experiments shall lead to the findings that we shall publish openly in the literature in due course.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research is primarily concerned with basic developmental neurobiology, but the implications could be very general in due course. Er81 is a key gene that is involved in the generation and differentiation of upper (layer 5 cortical) and lower (ventral horn spinal cord) motorneurons.

We sequenced transcriptomes from layers 1-6b of different areas (primary and secondary) of the adult (postnatal day 56) mouse somatosensory cortex to understand the transcriptional levels and functional repertoires of coding and noncoding loci for cells constituting these layers. A total of 5,835 protein-coding genes and 66 noncoding RNA loci are differentially expressed (&amp;quot;patterned&amp;quot;) across the layers, on the basis of a machine-learning model (naive Bayes) approach. Layers 2-6b are each associated with specific functional and disease annotations that provide insights into their biological roles. This new resource (http://genserv.anat.ox.ac.uk/layers) greatly extends currently available resources, such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and microarray data sets, by providing quantitative expression levels, by being genome-wide, by including novel loci, and by identifying candidate alternatively spliced transcripts that are differentially expressed across layers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5B3B725-4C1E-44F8-8BF4-DF22BAD761B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first website that describe the layer-specific transcriptome of the adult mouse cortex using deep sequencing method.

Substantial populations of cerebral cortical neurons are generated in a specific sequence by the radial glia progenitors that line the ventricular surface during development. These radial progenitors self-renew and generate intermediate progenitors or neurons in a precisely choreographed fashion. 
in utero electroporation has become a central technique in the study of key aspects of neural development, such as progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and circuit formation. This method has also facilitated the exploitation of cell lineage and optogenetic techniques in various species from chick to gyrencephalic higher mammals. This chapter provides a description of the method and gives some examples for its utility in the study of cerebral cortical development and evolution.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc989fd787f1.42216374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>In Utero Electroporation Methods in the Study of Cerebral Cortical Development</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-3014-2_2</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Allen Brain Institute contacted us to advise them on the collection and analysis of the developmental transcriptomic atlas in macaque cerebral cortex.
