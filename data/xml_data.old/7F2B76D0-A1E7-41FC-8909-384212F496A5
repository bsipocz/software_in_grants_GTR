Research suggests that ER is still developing in adolescence, but also that adolescence is a key time for the emergence of mental illness associated with poor ER.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to investigate how ER develops during normative adolescence between ages 11-16. It will investigate this both cross-sectionally (comparing adolescents of different ages tested at the same time) and longitudinally (comparing the same adolescents between one year and the next). ER will be measured using computerised tasks and questionnaires, completed at school. Parents and teachers will also complete questionnaires about adolescents? behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will measure both explicit ER (conscious use of strategies to control feelings) and implicit ER (the ability to maintain concentration in the presence of emotion). The study will also look at links between ER and symptoms of anxiety, depression and aggression: do specific aspects of ER relate particularly strongly to these symptoms? If so, this could provide a target for future attempts at improving adolescent wellbeing. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
The research has the potential to benefit professionals working in the field of child and adolescent mental health and wellbeing, including clinical and educational psychologists, teachers, and other youth workers. It would also be of benefit to adolescents themselves as well as their parents and carers. It may also have the potential to benefit policy-makers in the fields of education and mental health.

How will they benefit from this research?
Clinical and educational psychologists: The research is likely to be of benefit to these practitioners in the medium term. The findings will provide greater detail as to how different aspects of emotion regulation develop in adolescence, and how this development interacts with aspects of adolescent wellbeing, including mental health and social skills. I aim to liaise directly with these groups, so that the research findings may inform both preventative and intervention strategies implemented by clinical and educational psychologists working with adolescents. For example, the research will contribute to a much-needed evidence base for school-based strategies such as the 'Targeted Mental Health in Schools' (TaMHS) and 'Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning' (SEAL) initiatives. Eventually, I plan to work directly with these groups to develop an emotion regulation-based training programme for adolescents. Importantly, the aim would be to educate adolescents about ongoing development in this area of cognitive function, and to scaffold and support this development; rather than 'pathologising' adolescence or providing excuses for challenging behaviour.

Teachers and youth workers: The research will be of benefit to these groups in the short to medium term. I plan to communicate my research findings widely within these groups to raise awareness of the precise nature of ongoing brain and cognitive development in adolescence. This is vital in a field in which many strategies and initiatives are not evidence-based. In the longer term, it is hoped that the research will contribute to the evidence base on which new and improved initiatives can be developed, in partnership with these professionals.

Adolescents and their parents and carers: In the short term, I aim to communicate with these groups to raise awareness about adolescent brain and cognitive development in general, as well as the specific findings of the proposed project. A web resource will be set up for this purpose, and I will continue to speak at schools and public engagement events to raise awareness of my research and its implications. From previous experience, adolescents and parents value this interaction, as it helps them to better understand behavioural changes that may occur during adolescence. In the longer term, it is hoped that these groups will benefit from improved evidence-based initiatives that scaffold healthy emotion regulation development, as well as reducing the emergence of symptoms associated with poor emotion regulation.

Policy makers: I have previously contributed to policy reports including 'Foresight: Mental Capital and Wellbeing' and 'Beyond Current Horizons' (both 2008), detailing ongoing adolescent brain and cognitive development and its relevance for educational and social policy. Since then, the field of adolescence research has developed considerably, and the financial climate in which policies directed at adolescents are made has worsened. Policy makers can no longer afford to invest in policies without a clear evidence base. The proposed research will contribute evidence relevant to social and educational policies for young people.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245515</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Clinical and Academic Group (CAG)</gtr:description><gtr:id>56D0D2AB-0F0C-4118-B009-C8F4AD9D2125</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is at an early stage so there are no outputs as yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a1594377ab8.79793294-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners include both academic and clinical members who contribute expertise on a range of topics relating to atypical child development and mental illness.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a partnership between academics and clinicians across universities and NHS services in Surrey with a focus on issues related to the study of atypical child development and mental illness.

The first (involving a collaboration with Dr Leah Somerville at Harvard University) examined the efficacy of an emotion regulation strategy called 'temporal distancing', e.g. thinking 'this will not matter in 5 years' time. We examined how the ability to use this strategy develops over the course of adolescence and into adulthood, and how it relates to behaviour and mental health. We developed a new task for looking at this strategy use in a controlled laboratory setting, and found that mentally projecting yourself into the future reduces distress as measured by both questionnaire and skin-conductance (physiological) measures. The further into the future one projected, the lower the self-reported distress. Both adolescents and adults were able to use this strategy effectively. However, participants who reported more aggressive behaviour in everyday life were less effective in reducing their distress using the strategy, and tended to project themselves less far ahead in time. Our findings are in revision for publication in the journal Cognition and Emotion. For the second project, we have acquired a rich dataset comprising cognitive and psychometric measures of emotion regulation and mental health in &amp;gt;350 adolescents aged 11-16 across two time points, and in ~100 adult participants. Preliminary analyses suggest that individual differences such as tendency to engage in aggressive behaviour are more important than age in predicting emotion regulation efficacy during adolescence. However, general emotional reactivity may decrease over this same age range. Analyses are ongoing, with the next step being to focus on longitudinal change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Data analyses are still ongoing, but we envisage that the findings will be of interest to educators and those working in child and adolescent mental health.
