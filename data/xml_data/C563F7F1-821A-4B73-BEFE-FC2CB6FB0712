A major difficulty is the enormous range of timescales involved, and nearly all models are forced to make some approximation in order to &amp;quot;filter out&amp;quot; dynamics taking place on timescales that are much shorter than those of interest. This filtering is essential in computer simulations of large-scale fluid flows, because otherwise the majority of the computational power would be wasted resolving the &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; dynamics that is of no scientific interest.

The most important example of this problem comes from sound waves, which are waves of rapid expansion and compression that are ubiquitous in real fluids, yet generally play a negligible role in the fluid's dynamics. Most fluid flows are only weakly compressible, because the flow speed is much slower than the speed of sound, and we would therefore like to filter sound waves out of the fluid equations, yielding a &amp;quot;sound-proof&amp;quot; model. There are several existing methods to achieve this filtering, but these methods often violate certain physical laws that the real system must obey, such as conservation of energy, and in many cases this produces unphysical results.

We propose an alternative framework for obtaining a general sound-proof model, using the techniques of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. This type of mathematics, which is frequently used in discrete mechanics and classical field theory, is underutilised in fluid mechanics, but offers two crucial advantages. First, the filtering of sound waves can be achieved in a simple and intuitive way, by imposing particular constraints on the dynamics. Second, with this method the conservation laws are built in from the outset, avoiding the unphysical behaviour that can arise with other methods.

As well as providing a general methodology for filtering sound waves, which has applications across a wide range of physical applications, we will develop an efficient algorithm to simulate sound-proof flows computationally, and use this to study two problems for which traditional methods are inadequate: thermal convection in a rapidly rotating fluid, and the generation of strong magnetic field within the Sun.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Sound-proof models are employed in practically every area of fluid dynamics research. For example, the anelastic approximation is routinely used in models of weather prediction (particularly convection and cloud formation), Earth's liquid outer core, and the interiors of stars and gas planets. The results of our work will therefore have applications across an extremely wide range of fluid systems.

This research crosses the boundaries between the various sub-disciplines within fluid dynamics, and is informed by the state-of-the-art modelling approaches used in each. An important impact will therefore be the transfer of knowledge between research communities, and we will organise an interdisciplinary fluid dynamics meeting in Newcastle to spark new collaborations within this area. This is particularly timely because models of Earth's global circulation are now for the first time beginning to resolve dynamics well below the mesoscale, such as cloud formation. Our proposal is to develop a hybrid of the pseudo-incompressible and quasi-hydrostatic approximations, which will consistently describe both the small-scale and the large-scale dynamics of any weakly compressible flow.

The PDRA and the internally-funded PhD student will gain useful and transferable skills that are highly valued by employers in both the public and private sectors. They will receive training in mathematical modelling, in the use of high-performance computing (including parallel programming), and in the presentation and communication of complex ideas. The PDRA will also have the opportunity to manage aspects of the student's work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174577</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R024952/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
