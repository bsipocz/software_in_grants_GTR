A corollary of this has been the expansion of ?public accountability? to accommodate business-led targets and protocols in the evaluation and monitoring of education provision. School-based accountability measures now include for example:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;legal&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>hierarchical&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contractual&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>network&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>participative&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>professional. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project undertakes an original and timely investigation of how these measures work, combine and what their effects are within academies (eg publicly funded independent schools), free schools (eg all-ability parent-run schools) and maintained schools (eg community and foundation schools). Framed within a policy sociology approach, it examines how these differently governed schools engage with stakeholders, LA officers, trust committee members, parents and community groups as well as wider networks of collaboration, federation and competition in their role as education providers. &lt;br />&lt;br />The data will offer an original and accessible account of the complex arrangements that combine to produce particular relations between schools and their stakeholders within different socio-economic, geographical, policy and institutional settings. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be accessible and relevant to a wide range of audiences including parents, teachers, headteachers, community stakeholders, academics, politicians, policy-makers, practitioners, and trade unionists. The evidence generated will also appeal to a large number of government and non-government organisations, including for example: Ofsted, the Department for Education (DfE), the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and other teachers' unions, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT), the New Schools Network (NSN), Local Authorities (LAs), independent policy bodies, schools, and community stakeholders (or sponsors) who participate in school initiatives.

To enable the outputs to be used more widely and have greater impact, the results will be disseminated to Ofsted (the school's inspectorate). The data will also have strong implications for the SSAT, NSN and LAs who run schools in state-maintained education. In addition, community stakeholders and independent policy bodies will be interested in the practical implications this research carries for understanding parents' experiences and perceptions of local education provision. These key groups can also to help to guide the final stage of the writing process and be instrumental to further disseminating the results to other interested policy agencies, institutions and research bodies. 

The Department of Education and the CEREPP at Roehampton University would play a key role in maximising the impact of my research and developing knowledge exchange strategies through: 1) a research seminar to be organised as part of the CEREPP seminar series; 2) a special 'Education and Social Justice' conference which would bring together academics, policy-makers, and practitioners to discuss the practical/policy implications of the project; and 3) a dissemination seminar to engage parents, teachers, headteachers, and other stakeholders from participating schools. Sharing research findings in this way will increase awareness of the research as well as help to tease out issues, helping to shape the final stages of the writing process. As part of the dissemination seminar, I would also distribute briefing papers and a handbook for teachers and parents based on the research to promote forms of accountability that support and facilitate relations between parents and schools. In addition, with the help of Professor Gill Crozier, Roehampton University and Department of Education colleagues, I would feedback the research into the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes within the university, with the aim to develop teacher awareness and understanding of these issues. 

The scope of the research is interdisciplinary and will therefore appeal to a wide range of researchers and teachers working within and across specialist areas including education, public policy and the third sector, sociology and geography. Specifically, the research intends to fill an existing gap in the policy and academic literature on Academies and the emerging free schools programme where little in-depth, ethnographic data have been collected to show the relationships between these schools and the parents and communities they 'serve'. In terms of direct benefits, the research will generate models of 'good practice' for shaping and steering the development of participative accountability and user engagement within and across different types of schools in the state-maintained sector, thus working towards improving accountability between schools and parents, schools and school governors, and schools and community stakeholders. Government and non-government bodies will also benefit from briefing papers, working papers and dissemination seminars to be facilitated by the PI. These forms of research output and public engagement will work to devise strategies for improving policy and practice in education and generate spaces for debate, dialogue and deliberation on the outcomes of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165104</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker (Plymouth University)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D9827BD4-C542-462F-9635-45BC590CBAD8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stimulated discussion and facilitated debate

In 2012 I created a blog (http://saseproject.com) to ensure that key project developments relating to emerging findings, impact, publications and events could be easily communicated and disseminated to a wider audience. The blog has attracted over 2,200 followers and generated awareness and debate of the issues raised through the project. Specifically, the blog has 1) increased visibility of the project; 2) opened up possibilities for engaging different stakeholders and audiences including academics, governors, consultants, journalists and campaigners; 3) created productive spaces for facilitating dialogue and debate between and across these audiences; and 4) made the research accessible and beneficial to the public. 

2013-2014: Final reports
All nine participating schools in the project were provided with a final report at the end of the data collection phase. Each report provided tailored, contextualised information about the school, including detailed evidence and observations about how the school engaged with different strategies to enhance accountability and effective governance of their school. To maximise the impact and usefulness of the report for those involved, specific recommendations were offered on how governance might be improved for the benefit of different stakeholders. All reports have been anonymised and are accessible through Researchfish.

Both senior school leaders and governors responded positively to the insight and utility of the reports. Feedback suggests that the reports were used by senior school leaders and governors primarily to reflect on their own practice, to promote the work they do to the wider community, to identify areas that required improvement or to acknowledge areas that proved efficient or optimal, and to demonstrate to external regulators (namely the school's inspectorate and the Department for Education) a commitment to self-monitoring and evaluation. Outlined below are some indicators of impact highlighted by senior school leaders and governors:

'Your report has been invaluable. As you may imagine, the director of education asked where the governors were and why did we not know in advance. Your report was essential evidence to show that an external audit found a strong governing body etc.' 

'Thanks for your report, very perceptive and now a useful document to grow with'.

'Your engagement and subsequent report has been useful in a variety of ways: It has given us confidence that we are working effectively - providing a 'champagne moment' in amongst the months of hard slog. It has highlighted some areas for development - particularly looking ahead to sustainability. When undergoing a recent inspection by our DfE appointed Educational Advisor, it was a useful overview document, with the additional authority of being produced by an independent academic. It has provided some additional, credible content for our Governor's Annual Report (to be published in Sept 2014). We intend to publish it on the school website and to supply it to those considering applying to become governors in our next intake'.

'We were very happy with the report and agreed completely with the main points made. In terms of how we used it - we gave it to the OFSTED inspectors during a recent inspection as an example of how as Governing Body we are committed to understanding where we are and what we need to do. Their assessment of us was similar to yours as well'.

'We also undertook a Governor Evaluation in January and it featured heavily in not only our assessment of our current level of competence but also in planning training etc to fill the gaps. Our new head was given a copy so that he had an insight in the GB [governing body] at the school'.

'It was a really effective way of getting a picture of how effective a GB we are from an independent source. It confirmed what we thought but were finding it hard to articulate'.

'I thought that your report was admirable in its clarity and insight. As is often the case with such exercises the picture that comes back is recognisable, albeit with some features distorted compared to how one sees them oneself. One feature that came out of some Governors' comments was the sense that some were suspicious about being given good news all the time and rather assumed that this was because they were not being given the whole story'.

2013: Education Select Committee 2013
I submitted evidence to the Education Select Committee 2013 inquiry into academies and free schools in 2013. The evidence was later published on the UK Parliament website on 8 January 2014 (Reference: AFS0008).

2014: Conference
I organised a one-day conference at the University of Roehampton, London which took place on 23 October 2014. The conference was used to launch the main findings and recommendations from the project. A briefing report was created and disseminated widely to the media and government, third sector and private sector agencies following the conference. Discussants included Chris Caroe (Department for Education), Brian Lightman (Association of School and College Leaders, ASCL), Emma Knights (National Governors' Association, NGA), Professor Stephen Ball (UCL IOE), Professor Gill Crozier (University of Roehampton), Professor Becky Francis (King's College, London), and Professor Helen Gunter (University of Manchester).

The conference reached maximum capacity (85+ attendees, with 30+ on waiting list) and received wider online attention due to the large number of attendees who tweeted the event using the hashtag #saseconf. Conference attendees including a wide variety of constituents including people from governor support services, government agencies, think tanks, schools, local authorities and universities. Feedback on the conference is included below:

'I really enjoyed the conference and thought that your work had tremendous value in prompting reflection, debate and in a specific instance helping to highlight the DfE's attitude to academic research! I have mentioned your work to several folk since and am wondering about organising a conference for governors and school leaders in Canterbury later in the year'.

'Thank you for inspiring the conference last week and for sharing your research with us. I found the conference of real interest and although the broad spread of the platform made for a little more heat than light, it did provide a very good introduction to the range of responses to the issues and the stances adopted by different academics and stakeholders'.

'Thank you for your yesterday's event. I found it very stimulating - and helpful as I approach that stage in my book where I consider what has happened over the last few years and what the future of governance might be. And it was good to meet you face-to-face at last. I think the work you have done and your analysis constitute important insights which will benefit all our work'.

'Thank you for the copy of your presentation. I found your research very informative and thought provoking. It opens up the debate around school governance and the effectiveness of board of governors. Moreover, it provides a good basis for my own PhD research which is looking at delivery of financial education in secondary schools. Interviewing school governors is part of my research. So your findings was very helpful for setting the context for me. I will be interested in your final paper'. 

'It was a very interesting and unusual gathering in the way it brought such diverse constituencies together'.

2014: Faculti Media
I was invited to give an interview for Faculti Media to discuss the project and showcase the research at the University of Roehampton. The interview is in production and due to be broadcast on the Faculti Media website and their You Tube channel later this year.

2014: Media coverage
There was media coverage of the project in 2014. An article written by Helen Ward and entitled Are cliques taking control of our governing bodies? was published in the Times Education Supplement (TES) on 14 November 2014 http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6450359

2014: External adviser 
I was invited to act as adviser to iEd and PCG who at the time were working in partnership to development a bespoke professional development training model to support schools through a series of accountability phases. I was invited to give insight and feedback on the model as part of the proof of concept stage. Testimonial below:

'Andrew participated in a proof of concept meeting in February looking at the challenges schools face regarding accountability and the solutions that iEd are designing to meet those challenges. Andrew's insight into the modern landscape of governance is unparalleled. His knowledge is based upon first hand research and detailed discussion with a number of governors and governing bodies. This is backed up by an awareness of thought and opinion on the emerging shape of governance both in this country and internationally. His continued work in this area, raising awareness and begging key questions continues to support the necessary review and reshaping of modern governance'.

2014: Serialisation
In 2014 governor support agency Modern Governor, a leading provider of online professional development for school governors and academy trust board members, reproduced with permission from and Taylor and Francis a serialisation of my article for Journal of Education Policy (JEP): 

Wilkins, A. (2015) Professionalising school governance: The disciplinary effects of school autonomy and inspection on the changing role of school governors. Journal of Education Policy, 30 (2), 182-200

Learning Manager for Modern Governor, Ian Usher, wrote 'To say that the article would interest readers of Modern Governor would be an understatement - having read it I think it's really important and essential reading for thoughtful Governors (and those concerned with Governance)'. Modern Governor subsequently serialised the article into 5 smaller pieces spread over 2 weeks and invited comments from governors.

2014: Keynote at UMSGI
I was invited to give a keynote at the annual University of Manchester Governor Initiative (UMSGI) at The Chancellors Conference Centre, Manchester, on 30 April 2015. The audience consisted in the main of school governors and senior school leaders. UMSGI is part of the University of Manchester's widening participation and social responsibility strategy and boasts one of the UK's most extensive programmes of work with local state schools and colleges - particularly those in more challenging circumstances.

2014: SSAT
I was ask to contribute an article to SSAT (The School's Network) termly journal. The article was entitled How the role of school governors' has changed - and how it should change. SSAT is a UK-based, independent educational membership organisation working with primary, secondary, special, free schools, academies and UTCs. The SSAT journal is disseminated to all schools in the network, one of the largest school networks in England. 

2015: The Key for School Governors
In 2015 I was invited to present key findings and recommendations from the project to The Key for School Governors in London on 20 January 2015. The Key for School Governors is a national information service that provides over 13,000 governors with guidance, insight and instant answers to their questions on all aspects of school governance.

2015: SGOSS
In 2015 I was invited to present key findings and recommendations from the project to the School Governors One-Stop Shop (SGOSS) in London on 28 January 2015. SGOSS is funded by the Department for Education and dedicated to recruiting volunteers to serve on school governing bodies across England.

2015: Westminster Briefing
In 2015 I participated in a Westminster Briefing entitled Supporting and Empowering School Governors. My presentation was entitled A new role for local authorities: strategic oversight at a time of rapid decentralisation. The event took place in London on 12 March 2015 and featured speakers from government and third sector agencies including Peter Swift (Deputy Director, Independent Education and School Governance Division, DfE), Clare Collins (Lead Consultant, National Governors Association), Frank Norris (Director, The Co-operative Academies Trust) and Andy Kent (Chair, National Co-ordinators of Governor Services (NCOGS)), Steve Barker (National Leader of Governance &amp;amp; Head of Governance), and Duncan Haworth (Chair of Governors, Woodfall Primary &amp;amp; National Leader of Governance).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3988AE32-CC1B-4051-B40A-2161D001B965</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a169dbd69b8.52333355</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research objectives

In line with the stated objectives, this research investigated the direction and purpose of school governance in England under current government arrangements to remove the majority of schools from local government control. A related focus of the research concerned how schools at this time engage with different stakeholders and external authorities as part of their overall strategy to enhance accountability, with additional questions concerning the purpose and impact of different accountability measures. This research has generated knowledge with practical implications for both policy and practice, as well as contributed to challenging and rethinking dominant understandings of school governance and accountability through the development and application of new theoretical models.

New knowledge

This research contributes significantly to our understanding of how schools are constructed as publicly accountable entities at a time of rapid deregulation (and re-regulation). Through utilizing a post-governmentality perspective, this research offers original and timely insights concerning the impact of wider socio-political forces (key among them, decentralisation, marketization and depoliticisation) on the changing role and responsibilities of governors and the preferred models of governance by which schools are enjoined to act. The research highlights particular trends in school governance, including

1. An exclusive focus on 'high calibre' or 'professional' volunteers as preferred governors and the marginalization or problematisation of traditional stakeholder models of governance;
2. The reorientation of school governors towards adopting new skills and attitudes, specifically positive attitudes towards technocratic precision and the routine performance of checks and balances; 
3. The rolling out of data-gathering techniques and professional standards by which school and governor performance can be measured, judged and evidenced to external authorities; and
4. The expansion of private sector participation in public sector organization, evidenced by the appeal to experts and expertise as key drivers for school improvement and enhanced accountability.

Partnerships and collaboration

The insights generated through the research have been particularly welcome by private and third sector agencies interested in developing professional support and training for school governors. These agencies include SGOSS (funded by the Department for Education), SSAT, Modern Governor, The Key, and the National Governors Association (NGA). In addition to holding separate dissemination events with some of these agencies, I have been invited to write for their annual newsletters, blogs and magazines. It is strongly anticipated that these agencies will open up further opportunities for impact and dissemination in the future as well as serve as 'experts' or advisers on future research bids.

Further research

The data generated through the research has not only helped to enrich the field of school governance and accountability as a timely and fascinating area of study; it has also pointed to areas which are significantly under-researched and which require further investigation. An additional component of the research was a study of school governance across four schools in Vanserborg and Gothenburg, Sweden. This research enabled the development of new networks and contributed to thinking about large-scale, international research focused on analyzing and comparing school governance across different countries with related policy agendas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In line with the pathways to impact set out in the proposal, this research has engaged directly with multiple constituents using different levers of engagement in order to 1) generate a feedback loop to establish reliability and validity of findings; 2) facilitate partnerships and networks to be used in the formulation of policy recommendations; and 3) produce knowledge with significant practical implications for helping school governors and senior leaders think about the relationships between school governance and accountability. Apart from the governor support agencies already listed above, the research can be used and applied by schools and school trusts as part of their self-evaluation, enabling them to reflect critically on the purpose and impact of different accountability measures for different constituents. 

The research also has practical applications for thinking about how local accountability (including economies of scale and efficiency) might be strengthened through greater centralization of some key practices, namely strategic planning, budgetary control and performance monitoring of schools. The formation of school trusts and clusters, ultimately leading to greater collaboration, partnerships and sharing of good practice between schools, is emphasized as a panacea to some of dangers of decentralization, namely school isolation and competition.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>687BFAC3-1564-4BE3-9C0E-B4677A95FE0D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a182f53c833.41793892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://uel.academia.edu/AndrewWilkins/ESRC-SASE-Project-(2012-15)</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E93FBDD7-A215-4842-90EA-304B4CADF680</gtr:id><gtr:title>Governanza escolar democr&amp;aacute;tica</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebdaa40fff5ef82e70b45cd55e88d1f1"><gtr:id>ebdaa40fff5ef82e70b45cd55e88d1f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilkins, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9788471127846</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>55891240afb038.63425895</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>191522AD-7D93-4B57-97A7-78285AFB4AA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Governing through parents: a genealogical enquiry of education policy and the construction of neoliberal subjectivities in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discourse: Studies in Cultural Politics of Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08be6ed36f16f16acddd6169473b4273"><gtr:id>08be6ed36f16f16acddd6169473b4273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olmedo, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b9c6fb576b77.89388518</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56EACCE3-29E7-4A06-A7B9-D051E855674C</gtr:id><gtr:title>How school governors' role is changing -
