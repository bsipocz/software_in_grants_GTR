A joint review and scoping study.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I507698/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The project's purpose was to jointly review existing qualitative and quantitative data from two separate projects, providing new insights on grounded and embodied community practices in the context of everyday religion and belonging. Researchers engaged in knowledge exchange and dialogue with new and former research participants, other researchers involved in similar research and wider academic networks beyond the core disciplines represented here, principally anthropology and geography.

Key concluding themes related to the ambivalent nature of 'faith'; connections over place and time and the contested nature of community. The collaboration was useful to allow mutual engagements and important insights about religion, place, space, and faith. Implicit in terms like faith, community and life course are larger interwoven narratives of space, time, place, corporeality and emotion. In conclusion, we found that understanding how places, 'communities' and 'faiths' differ and intersect requires an understanding of social 'relatedness', including the social boundaries through which relationships are formed, experienced, mediated and transmitted. Further research is necessary, potentially cross-culturally, on the sometimes invisible roles of community volunteers and activists, particularly older women and young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32033</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Mainly through teaching, research, writing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>14A53A3C-CC3A-454D-9099-BA6B52C360E5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545e36cbe64f34.75114878</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was the result of an experimental interdisciplinary collaboration

between Abby Day, an anthropologist, and Ben Rogaly, a geographer,

instigated by the consortium on Connected Communities, led by the UK's Arts

and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). Substantively we set out to

compare our original studies based on a total of 143 interviews in the

mid-2000s with children, teenagers, and adult men and women in two separate

projects in two English counties: North Yorkshire and East Anglia. Rogaly's

work in Norwich, East Anglia, was already a collaborative interdisciplinary

study with historian Becky Taylor. Day's work continued through an ESRC

grant, allowing her to re-visit participants first studied between 2002 and 2005.

While Day's work made central issues of belief and belonging and the relation

between them and thus provided deep insights into faith and religion (see e.g.

Day, Believing), these were only bi-products of Rogaly and Taylor's work, the

central concern of which was a critical analysis of the construction of the

study's location in a 'deprived white community' (Rogaly and Taylor, Moving).

As part of our joint study, we reviewed our separate projects and contrasted

their findings on the themes of community and faith. We then tested our

emerging findings among former and new research participants through

informal interviews and group discussions in our 'home' county of East

Sussex. Restrictions of time and funding allowed only a small number of new

interviews and we therefore sought a range of gender, religiosity, and age: one

middle-aged female rabbi known for her community engagement; one

middle-aged Muslim male medical doctor actively engaged in environmental

activism and in a spiritual community; one elderly retired policeman

nominally attached to a Christian church; one young agnostic female

university student and one young atheist male student, both involved in

academic and voluntary work concerning international development.

Following the interviews, we discussed and reflected on our impressions.

 Key concluding themes related to the ambivalent nature of 'faith', connections over place and time, and

the contested nature of community. Implicit in terms like 'faith', 'community',

and 'life course' are larger interwoven narratives of space, time, place, corporeality,

and emotion. The authors found that understanding how places, communities, and

faiths differ and intersect requires an understanding of social relatedness and

boundaries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Community building.
