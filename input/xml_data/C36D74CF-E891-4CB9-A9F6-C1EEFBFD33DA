There is accumulating evidence that large part of this control system is active during movement observation. More than twenty years ago Prof Rizzolatti and colleagues discovered single neurons in area F5 of macaque monkeys brain responding not only to monkey grasping but also to observation of the same grasp performed by human experimenter. These neurons were called &amp;quot;mirror neurons&amp;quot;. Our group made a major contribution to the field of mirror neurons by discovering that in area F5 and in primary motor cortex even neurons directly connected to the spinal motor neurons can be modulated just by observation of an action. This apparent paradox of the motor system being active during action observation without production of any movement challenges our understanding of how movements are generated and prompts research to identify what separate movement execution from action observation.
An obvious candidate is somatosensory system that responds to changes to the surface or internal state of the body. Somatosensory input is clearly very different between observation of a grasp when hand is at rest and grasp execution when hand is moving and touching an object. This difference might be an important contributing factor to why movements do not occur during action observation despite mirror neuronal activity present in motor areas. A dramatic examples of how powerful the somatosensory input is for perception is the &amp;quot;rubber hand&amp;quot; illusion: light stroking of subject hand combined with observation of synchronous stroking of an artificial hand forces subjects to believe that an artificial rubber hand is their own and that they can control it. 
To understand the possible contribution of somatosensory input to the mechanisms of movement suppression during action observation, we suggest to investigate the somatosensory properties of the mirror neuron system (MNS). This includes responses of single mirror neurons to light touch, hair brushing and passive hand movement. Some neurons in area F5, where mirror neurons where discovered, have been shown to respond to such stimulation but it was not so far tested for mirror neurons. And more specifically we will investigate differences in somatosensory properties of facilitation and suppression mirror neurons discovered in our laboratory. 
It is well established that during movement we are less sensitive to the sensory input, eg touch. This reduced sensitivity manifests itself in a smaller neuronal signal in response to electrical stimulation of the nerve in comparison to the response at rest. This phenomenon is called sensory attenuation but it was not tested for mirror neurons. Non-invasive studies aiming at revealing sensory attenuation during action observation are contradictory. Some studies report attenuation while others enhancement. To resolve this controversy it is critical to investigate sensory attenuation on the level of local neuronal signals.
In classical studies of the MNS, subjects just passively observe the actors' movements. In real life, it is quite often an active observation. While we execute an action we simultaneously observe a similar action, e.g. in a shared motor task such as two surgeons working together. Here action observation happens in the presence of somatosensory input, which resembles somatosensory input of an actor. What happens to the MNS simultaneously driven by action execution and action observation? To answer this question we will combine invasive neurophysiological investigation of non-human primates with non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies of human volunteers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>It is now well established that much of the cortical motor network involved in movement production is active during action observation. We showed that even corticospinal output neurons, projecting from the motor cortex to the spinal cord, can be modulated just by observation of an action, without any sign of movement in the observer. How can these outputs be active without movement? This challenges our understanding of how movements are generated and prompts research to identify neuronal signals that separate movement execution from action observation.
An obvious candidate for such a signal, surprisingly neglected in research so far, is somatosensory input which is clearly very different between passive action observation and action execution. Neurons in area F5, where mirror neurons were discovered, have been shown to receive significant somatosensory input. We suggest to investigate the somatosensory properties of the mirror neuron system (MNS). In particular, we are interested whether facilitation and suppression mirror neurons discovered in our lab show different somatosensory properties. We will test responses of mirror neurons to natural tactile and proprioceptive stimulation. In addition, we will investigate whether response evoked in the MNS by electrical nerve stimulation attenuates/gated during action observation.

Mirror neurons attracted significant amount of public attention and many far reaching claims about their role in explaining how &amp;quot;brain works&amp;quot; have been done. Many of those claims cannot be supported by solid experimental evidences addressing basic properties of mirror neurons. Our laboratory attempts to fill this void by investigating input and output properties of mirror neurons and connectivity within the mirror neuron system. Our findings will promote understanding of the mirror neuron system on the level of single neurons and local field potentials. By combining electrophysiological studies in non-human primates and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in healthy human volunteers using analogous experimental setups we attempt to bridge the gap between animal and human studies of the mirror neurons system.

Secondly, by communicating our findings to as large an audience as possible, we hope to reach experts in sport science and therapy, motor learning, movement disorders and movement rehabilitation. Movement rehabilitation therapies such as for example after stroke, have already been looking into possibility to use movement observation, ie mirror neuron activity, to improve an outcome. Such attempts might be extended and improved by a better understanding of what the mirror neuron system, which is active during both movement execution and observation, can contribute to rehabilitation. It is potentially more bnefitial to the patients to use a combination of (a) movement therapy, (b) movement observation and (c) attempted or performed movements plus simultaneous observation of movements; with the latter being one of the main aims of the proposed project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>497886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P006027/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E793F7FE-614C-4A45-83A0-BE79B172092C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal &amp; human physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F439A20B-A9B0-4A68-B703-7F6AE7570E39</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
