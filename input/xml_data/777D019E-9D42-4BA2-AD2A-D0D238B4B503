Now think smaller: you can do a similar thing at a very small scale using generic synthetic receptors - molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) - produced in the form of very small, one billionth of a metre in size (nano)particles (MIP NPs). Essentially these are &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; pieces of plastic that can be tailored to bind to a target by the creation of tiny pocket-like cavities (the &amp;quot;imprint&amp;quot;) that match the size and shape of the peptide, protein or virus (the &amp;quot;right hand&amp;quot;) to be detected. These MIP NPs to date represent the most generic, versatile, scalable and cost-effective approach to the creation of &amp;quot;artificial antibodies&amp;quot;, hence the proposed research for this Fellowship would like to determine if MIP NPs can be developed as an alternative and a direct replacement to natural antibodies (which are routinely generated from animal sources such as mice, rabbits and guinea pigs) for the detection of a very important infectious disease, avian influenza, that produces devastating consequences to animal health and poses a threat to public health. Novel MIP NPs will be able to replace natural antibodies in biological detection techniques (bioassays) and significantly reduce or even replace animal use. 

Recent developments in the automated synthesis of MIP NPs, pioneered by Prof. Piletsky's group, mean that for the first time a reliable supply of &amp;quot;soluble&amp;quot; synthetic nanoparticles can be made available for testing as potential biological active molecules. MIP NPs have many attributes that surpass current reagents: they can be produced in high yields, are stable unlike the current reagents being used, they are adaptable and versatile presenting themselves for use in many varieties of formats or assay designs. More importantly, substantiating the practicability's of these novel reagents by specific studies will lead to a replacement of animals, both large and small, to raise such specific serological materials. The MIP NPs will have the potential to detect viruses that are widely circulating in farm animals and indeed humans. Early and accurate identification of the infectious agent will expedite appropriate control measures. Thus diagnosis at an early stage of infection of a herd or flock or individual maximises the efficiency with which containment, prevention and possibly treatment strategies can be implemented. 

Success of this research could lead to further investigations into which the versatility of MIP NPs could be exploited for animal and human benefit outside veterinary medicine such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology and fine chemicals industry. The research into the development of MIP NPs that are highly specific coupled with diagnostic technology could be a significant contribution to the scientific advancement and cost effective diagnosis at global scale.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This Fellowship proposal aims to determine if artificial antibodies - molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MIP NPs) - can be developed as new diagnostic/therapeutic entities in veterinary medicine to directly replace bioassays for a very important infectious disease, avian influenza, which possesses an immense potential for harm to poultry, and also a dangerously high chance to spread from poultry and pigs to humans. To date, the molecular imprinting of polymers represents the most generic, versatile, scalable and cost-effective approach to the creation of synthetic molecular receptors. Recent developments in the automated synthesis of MIP NPs using an immobilised template approach pioneered in the group of Prof. Piletsky mean that for the first time a reliable supply of &amp;quot;soluble&amp;quot; synthetic nanoparticles with pre-determined molecular recognition and/or catalytic properties with sub-nanomolar affinities, defined size and surface chemistry can be made available for testing as potential bioactives. These bioactives may have the potential to detect viruses that are widely circulating in farm animals and indeed humans. Early and accurate identification of the infectious agent will expedite appropriate control and even treatment measures. Therefore, the research into the development of MIP NPs with high affinity coupled with diagnostic technology could be a significant contribution to the scientific advancement and cost effective diagnosis at global scale.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/L002175/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
