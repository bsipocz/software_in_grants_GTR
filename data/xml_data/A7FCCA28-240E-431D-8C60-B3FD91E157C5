The search indicated a range of research approaches claiming to be participatory and community-based, showing significant variation in degrees of participation and community control. Ethical challenges in CBPR include matters relating to: partnership, collaboration and power; community rights, conflict and representation; ownership and dissemination of data, findings and publications; anonymity, privacy and confidentiality; institutional ethical review processes; and blurred boundaries between researcher and researched, academic and activist. While many of these issues are common in qualitative social research, what is distinctive about CBPR is the openness, fluidity and unpredictability of the research process. It is often complicated by multi-layered partnerships based on the negotiation of power relations between diverse groups (with specific histories, politics, cultures and personalities), whilst also being constrained by rigid structures of research governance. Recommendations include: the adoption of specific ethical guidelines for CBPR by UK researchers, funders and sponsors; ethnographic research on the CBPR process; a search of grey literature for accounts of CBPR from community perspectives; and further longitudinal research on outcomes of CBPR.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32469</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Four films

Participatory Ethics through Participatory Theatre, Durham University, Monday 22nd June 2015, 12.30-16.00 
a) What happened - an intensive small group workshop introducing participants to Forum Theatre as a means of reflecting on ethics in participatory research, facilitated by Frances Rifkin (Utopia Arts) and Sarah Banks (Durham University).
b) Participants: 11 people attended, mainly university staff and postgraduate students, with 2 participants from community organisations. 
c) Summary of any feedback received - participants found it useful to learn about 
the theory base of forum theatre; the experience of forum theatre as a participant; 
the danger of using theatre without understanding the process and possibilities.
d) Any learning/reflections - half a day is a good introduction, but people were keen for more depth.

Dilemmas Caf&amp;eacute;: Using Dialogue to Explore Ethical Challenges in Community-based Participatory Research, Durham University, Tuesday 23rd June 2015, 17.30-20.00
a) What happened - a community partner, a postgraduate researcher and an academic each presented a real life ethical dilemma arising in participatory research. The audience participated in world caf&amp;eacute; style dialogue on each dilemma around tables, feeding back at the end. It was facilitated by Sarah Banks (Durham University) and Sue Shaw (community partner). 
b) Participants: 23 people attended, mainly university staff and postgraduate students, with 8 participants from community organisations. 
? Summary of any feedback received - here is a summary of what people found most useful about the event: live examples of ethical dilemmas; being able to share with others honestly about key issues in research that are seldom talked about; bringing different perspectives together and preparing for the unexpected; stimulating thinking about the research process and ensuring no harm comes to the people involved in research.
c) Any learning/reflections - this model works well and can be used in teaching and learning about ethical issues in all research (or indeed ethics in any setting). 
d) Any follow-up activities - the next meeting of the UK Participatory Health Network will include a dilemmas caf&amp;eacute;, as participants found the model very useful and stimulating.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc2df7ca2708.98541783</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/beacon/socialjustice/ccfestival2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>AHRC has used the ethics guide in Connected Communities funding calls.

The final version of the ethics guide is based on these principles:



Ethical principles



1. Mutual respect

2. Equality and inclusion

3. Democratic participation

4. Active learning

5. Making a difference

6. Collective action

7. Personal integrity



Practice principles and guidelines



1. Preparing and planning

2. Doing the research

3.
