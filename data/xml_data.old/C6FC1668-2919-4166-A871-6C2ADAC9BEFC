This research will combine academic expertise in contemporary product design and history to explore the social and cultural drivers of innovation in a historical context to provide new insight into the factors promoting innovation, its application and impact. It will explore the nature of creativity in the industrial context, and the opportunities and restrictions provided by technology and business to the creative process. Additionally, it will provide a pathway to greater understanding of business development through the application of research knowledge and illuminate the prescriptive use of technology to understand how cultural and social groups at home and overseas, adopted products and processes to meet their own requirement - or rejected them in favour of established methods. This process of 'taming' technology (domestication) by peoples in a wide variety of imperial contexts has been underexplored by designers, historians, anthropologists and cultural theorists and this research will both expose this area and appeal to a broad range of disciplines. 

By constructing a series of historical case studies, based on contemporary technological innovations such as steam power, the work will build a route to the greater understanding of and exposure to the nature of British imperialism and responses to it via a manageable research context and structure. It will also uncover insights into the nature of the Industrial Revolution and the industrial economy, with opportunities to apply the thinking behind this research to more modern industrial change in the developing economies of the world. By mapping these processes in an historical context, this research will shed light on contemporary design issues in a globalised economic context. 

The research questions addressed by this research are:
1. What components constituted the innovation ecosystem in the mature industrial economy of nineteenth century Britain?
2. What was the impact of design on this economy and its wider imperial context?
3. How, and in what ways, were these technologies and innovations 'domesticated' by the colonised and what can this tell us about the nature of imperialism in this period?

Taken together, this research will provide a model for a new interdisciplinary approach, bringing together historical and product design methodologies and theoretical frameworks to build a fresh perspective on the nature of innovation and the impact of design. For design practitioners, this research will also provide historical precedents for the contemporary reception of new technologies across a globalised marketplace, as well as provide space for a critical interrogation of the purpose and consequences of these processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on project team
The skills of the researchers will benefit by being exposed to new areas. The PI will be exposed to intricate archive research and the sourcing of primary sources for historical research. The CI will learn about the design process and how groups of people collaborate to innovate new designs. This provides a new and strategic academic link between distinct fields, and the intention of the project team is to build long-term collaboration between their institutions. Both partner institutions are admirably situated to support the development of this research, and its expansion into other networking and collaborative activities. The CI has already made links with the Duncan and Jordanstone College of Art and Design, University of Dundee, to access further expertise in the design field and situate the project into a positive institutional context. Likewise, the PI's institution, the University of Strathclyde, has as its mission to be among the leading technological universities in the world and its Department of Design, Manufacture and Engineering Management has extensive industrial contacts through Knowledge Exchange activity where the project findings on innovation can be applied. 

Impact on society
The project team would establish relations with each of the participating archives during data collection, while the project workshops will allow these organisations to input ideas on the project direction and progress. The basis of this public engagement component will be organising and hosting of two stakeholder workshops, to highlight the research being completed under the development grant, but also to begin an engaged dialogue with future potential collaborators in the academic, museums and design business worlds. A larger-scale research programme is planned which will move beyond the case study findings to identify contemporary businesses, processes and environments where similar situations of domestication of technology may arise. This will result in a better understanding of how innovation can be harnessed not just in economic terms but for the benefit of society. As well as commercial organisations, the future findings would be of interest to educational and statutory groups such as the Design Council and the Higher Education Academy for wider industrial and educational use. These would be potential collaborators in any larger future grant application. Both the PI and CI have extensive experience of public engagement through research, and this would be a priority of the project. British-wide museum and archive links (Museum of English Rural Life, Scottish Rural museums Network, V&amp;amp;A Dundee) have already been made with a view to (1) to provide the RA with valuable public engagement and impact experience (2) to promote the project and awareness of its findings among key stakeholders. 

This would be supplemented by use of social media to reach a wider audience: a project website and Facebook page will be established, and as research networks were built, project awareness would be increased via partner organisations' media outlets. 

Other key beneficiaries are both teachers and pupils, and the CI's establishment and administration in 2011 of an online network for academics and schools and colleges (the Scottish History Resources group) will provide a ready-made entry point to impact on this group. This kind of dialogue between academic researchers, schools and local communities is critical to the development of future research and engagement directions, and will support the development of the Scottish Government's Curriculum for Excellence agenda. As part of this new curriculum, new History topics have been introduced into schools and colleges, one of which is Changing Britain, 1760-1900: this project will feed into work already started by the CI to enhance the resources available to teachers through the development of an updatable electronic resource pack.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38444</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AHRC Award Holder's Design WorkshopA formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B1439BA1-3D10-439B-A646-8F173B40514E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AHRC Award Holder's Design Workshop

This project intended to develop, write and publish scholarly articles as part of its commitment to academic beneficiaries. Instead, the project team regard the more effective route for publication is instead a short scholarly monograph. This will allow a full exploration of the themes, approaches and literature, as well as a full exploration of the each of the case studies. We have begun the writing planning process, and have targeted Palgrave (under their Pivot series for shorter monographs) as the preferred publisher. Completion date: summer 2016. 

Conference papers

Future funding plans
The team intend to prepare a grant application to the AHRC, possibly incorporating other Design in Innovation Development Funding recipients, to explore the 'colonial side' of the migration framework. This will entail understanding more deeply the social impact of innovations utilised in the British Empire 1850-1914.


Impact outcomes and plans

Website
As defined by the grant call, the project team established a website for the project (Figure 3) which contains content on the case studies our research has identified, as well as sections on the overall methodology and scope. We have tried to present the work in a visual and engaging way with illustrations, diagrams and narrative to guide the viewer through the aims of the project and each case study. While the three primary case studies have been populated, the remaining two have skeleton content which can be added at a future date. 

Education and museums/heritage engagement 

This project has also developed two parallel, complimentary routes to impact, links to education, and links to the museum/heritage sector. 

Education
The project team have built links and opened a dialogue with Scottish teachers, in order to plan classes in the History and Design curriculums for excellence. Further time and funding will be required to bring this element of the project to completion. 

Museums/Heritage
The project team have opened a dialogue with the Museum of English Rural Life [MERL] (University of Reading) to discuss ways in which our research findings can be fed into their existing galleries and collections, and perhaps found the basis of a partnership to co-create a new gallery. MERL has recently (October 2014) been successful in securing a major HLF grant to redevelop its galleries, and this will provide the project team with a real opportunity to feed their original and new research findings into MERL's collections.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D394E6C-8EBD-45EE-82C2-124AD5EEF2BB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545746c7a75c51.68947260</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We intended to conduct five case studies (sugar production, steam ploughs, railways, bridges, minting) shortlisted from eleven potential case studies we had identified through a series of scoping exercises. We felt these five would provide a balanced overview of the technical, social, and business factors throughout the domestication process. Further research into the five studies, however, highlighted the richness of the archival resources for three of them (sugar production, railways and steam ploughs) and, given the limited timeframe and developmental nature of the funding, we have made these three studies the principal focus for our intended published outputs. We will, however, include the information we gathered during the scoping exercises on the other case studies where appropriate. 

Characteristics of innovation

From the completed case studies and indicators of the other identified cases, we have identified key characteristics and findings of innovation during this period in relation to the broader socio-economic landscape. 

We have also narrowed our focus. It became clear early on that the story of the transfer and diffusion of technology and innovation was vast, with a potentially huge chronological and geographical reach. Our work makes an original contribution by identifying the five stages of technological development (see chart below) and applying the case study technologies to it is a nuanced and complex way. 

Answers to the research questions
1. What components constituted the innovation ecosystem in the mature industrial economy of nineteenth century Britain?
The innovation ecosystem was one driven by entrepreneurial activity. Companies tended to be smaller in scale, and were driven by engineering activity. There was a close link between the decision makers and the workshop. This resulted in a highly responsive setting - the expertise that was still general enough to allow a company to cover a range of mechanical contexts. 

2. What was the impact of design on this economy and its wider imperial context?
The impact of design was designers had to acquire knowledge on the design problem through correspondence or infrequent visits. Detailed photographic or drawing information on settings was not readily available. This meant that designs were 

3. How, and in what ways, were these technologies and innovations 'domesticated' by the colonised and what can this tell us about the nature of imperialism in this period?
We have not answered the question on domestication. As described above, our archival findings did not allow us to pursue this direction, and so instead, we have developed thinking on how the British Empire provided opportunities for technologies and innovations. Captive markets were met by companies who had drive and ambition. This resulted in designs that met the technical challenges posed by logistics and the environment of use, but did not necessarily consider the broader societal impact or end users. As such, our revised research question is:

How far and in what ways, were opportunities in place to allow the migration of innovation and technologies and what can this tell us about the nature of imperialism, 1850-1914?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Taken together, this research provides a model for a new interdisciplinary approach, bringing together historical and product design methodologies and theoretical frameworks to build a fresh perspective on the nature of innovation and the impact of design.

As described above, our initial review revealed the motivations and actions of engineering companies in addressing the opportunities afforded by the British Empire as a rich area of study. As the framework was applied, a range of themes emerged: technical, social, business, commerce, capital and marketing factors. The topics identified across each of these themes, whether status, structure or activity, were highlighted through consultation with the literature and archive material. Not all cases address all of these topics, but instead provided us with a reference template to understand the 'shape' or emphasis of each case, and to allow comparison across cases.

This has been used extensively in the consumption of media and technology in society, typically identifying the four stages of 'appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion'. It was initially felt that this framework would be appropriate to help understand how unfamiliar or strange technologies (from the perspective of the local populations) were applied in colonial settings. As the research developed, however, it became clear that the innovation and business practices in Britain to adapt and prepare technologies for use in new contexts would be a major concern during our investigations. This decision to adjust our original focus was based on the range of our archival findings, the weight of the literature on issues such as engineering practices, patenting and intellectual property (theory and practice) and the design and business processes our targeted companies and technologies utilised. 

As a result we have altered and extended the framework, using the term 'migration' rather than 'domestication' as it better reflects the transfer of technology from the metropole to the colonial location. The stages in this process have been identified as 'identification, preparation, assignation, incorporation and conversion'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E84E7C1-9F29-4ACF-8E58-F1E147843CD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458a8f4279796.46074916</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>From 'domestication' to 'migration'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>938A42AB-2387-4273-957B-BA4A0A4CD33C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design, Technology and Communication in the British Empire, 1830-1914</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/10c6b84a2f3cef860c4462e50753f287"><gtr:id>10c6b84a2f3cef860c4462e50753f287</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tindley Annie</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137597977</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b55d289f1ee7.76392781</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5584E266-CD8C-42A9-8E64-5ECFF567C801</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Role of Social Networks in Agricultural Innovation: The Sutherland Reclamations and the Fowler Steam Plough, c.1855-c.1885</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Rural History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/06f5997346cb9888df6145e448a4a995"><gtr:id>06f5997346cb9888df6145e448a4a995</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>TINDLEY A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5458ab6fee8493.60682428</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FBF585B1-E9D8-420A-9830-813C5785F99E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design and Innovation in the British Empire, c. 1830-c. 1900: communication, knowledge and networks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>n/a</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1745d53b554df64462179fde40b63981"><gtr:id>1745d53b554df64462179fde40b63981</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tindley, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545747e6a118b5.88704821</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE339EA4-57B4-4508-A176-A2B46CD6F5CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design, Technology and Communication in the British Empire, 1830-1914</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/10c6b84a2f3cef860c4462e50753f287"><gtr:id>10c6b84a2f3cef860c4462e50753f287</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tindley Annie</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137597977</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5899bd59400849.05091102</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L010550/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
