exchange</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K000594/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Developed in a four-year partnership between geographers, migrant advocacy organisations and theatre artists, this research seeks to generate substantive, transnational debate on the policies of migrant labour and the politics of domestic caregiving in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Philippines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project represents a creative instance of exchange that disseminates conventional social science in a novel way. We are taking a testimonial theatre production - entitled Nanay - to Manila to bring the experiences of Filipino caregivers into conversation with debates happening within the Philippines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nanay transforms traditional qualitative research transcripts into testimonial theatre; our script is based entirely on verbatim monologues taken from interviews conducted over a fifteen year period with Filipino domestic workers, their children, employers, and nanny agents. As social scientists, we turn to theatre because it embodied quality offers space in which to encourage audiences to think about their world differently, to temporarily suspend judgment, and to extend the terrain of political discussion on the ethics of care in productive ways. We work with the awareness that because labour migration from the global south to the global north is a transnational issue, we must reconfigure the scale at which discussions of justice, care and need take place.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several key stakeholder and user groups that stand to benefit from our knowledge exchange activities. The central objective of this research is to bring important perspectives to on-going debates on temporary labour migration in the UK, Canada, and Philippines. Our work will have a direct impact for Filipino families of domestic workers in Canada and the UK. These families will be contacted and invited to participate in the public production of our testimonial play, in which migrant workers narrate their experiences in ways that are otherwise difficult, making a critical contribution to deepening and broadening discussion within the Philippines about the long-term impact of temporary labour migration on Filipino families. Performances of Nanay will be accompanied by public talkback sessions. In our previous productions of Nanay in Vancouver and Berlin, these talkbacks produced extraordinary conversations and exchange between user groups (employers, migrants, advocacy organisations and policy makers) who do not normally have the opportunity to dialogue on the issues. These forums will be video recorded and published online. Second, our subsequent public forums in the United Kingdom and Canada will have direct impact for policy makers, civil society partners, migrants, and researchers-who will be brought together to dialogue on issues pertaining to a new global paradigm of temporary migration. Thirdly, we believe that this project represents a significant effort to further the development and practice of innovative knowledge exchange pedagogy within the social sciences. This builds directly on the project's existing and considerable academic and non-academic impact. Responding to the intense interest across the social sciences in knowledge translation, we have devised this project to maximize public effect. In this respect, the broader academic community will benefit through our on-going publication on the project. We will submit a journal article to the Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, and a working paper to the Metropolis project-an international network for public policy development and which circulates its working papers within an extensive network of government agencies, researchers and advocacy groups. Lastly, this project will have lasting effects for Caleb Johnston and Geraldine Pratt; enabling them to continue a highly productive research and writing partnership, and in doing so, strengthen the international exchange between researchers at the University of Glasgow and University of British Columbia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33652</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This research has involved the performance of a testimonial theatre project (written by the PI and CO-I) designed to engender public debate about Canada's Live-In Caregiver Program, and directly addresses the experiences of Filipino domestic workers who come to Canada as migrant labourers. Nanay transforms very conventional qualitative interview transcripts into testimonial theatre, which is to say, our project is based entirely on verbatim monologues taken from interviews conducted over a 15 year period with domestic workers, their children and Canadian employers. Our overall objective in Nanay has been to forge a more complex identification with both the plight of domestic workers, as well as that of middle-class families struggling to secure affordable care in Canada. This phase of the this project, funded by the ESRC, has supported 15 performances of Nanay in Manila, Philippines.</gtr:description><gtr:id>59F79B7F-44B8-4B5C-8072-91B2E21451D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Please see list of publications, invited talks, and related KE activities in Manila.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cc5cf94de11.22011954</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Nanay: a testimonial play</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.calebjohnston.ca/nanay/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Philippine Educational Theater Association</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Philippines, Republic of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Artistic partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>5ACA3176-865B-448F-AC32-169EACD08A82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The major outcome of this collaboration was fifteen performances of our testimonial play to capacity audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9d9310eb9d9312c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>PETA provided a performance theatre, administrative staff, community outreach, and publicity to the our research activities.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project involved partnership with four professional Filipino actors and the Philippine Educational Theater Association in Manila (PETA).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nakai Theatre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Community Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>B87965EE-3089-4BC4-81FD-9893C514A8A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary outcome of this collaboration will be a script reading of our testimonial play in Whitehorse in January 2014.

We carried out five weeks of research in the Philippines, which culminated in fifteen critically acclaimed and sold-out performances of our testimonial play (entitled Nanay) at the Philippine Educational Theater Association. Each and every performance of Nanay was followed by an extended and facilitated public forum in which audience members were encouraged to explore and debate the political and ethical dilemmas raised by temporary labour migration, the ethics of global care, and family separation. Performances in Manila were attended by migrant workers, the family members of domestic workers in Canada, migrant advocacy groups, university representatitves, general public, local government officials, students, and a broad spectrum of non-governmental organisations. Our research in Manila has been documented through interviews with audience members, the family members of domestic workers, participating artists, as well as through audience questionnaires and recorded post-performance talkbacks. We have disseminated this research in leading academic journals, invited talks and public forums in Canada, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>66CC9C5F-FEC8-4893-8398-EDF0057BADF3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ccfe4a00ee8.55959381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has: 1) significantly furthered the development and practice of innovative knowledge exchange in the social sciences; 2) mobilised testimonial theatre as an means through which to stimulate and engender a genuinely transnational public debate on the politics of temporary labour migration and global care ethics; and 3) facilitated the sharing of information and experience between migrants, advocacy organisations and academics in Canada, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. This research has used testimonial theatre to reconfigure the scale at which deliberations of justice, care and need take place. We have looked to theatre to translate and disseminate social science research in order to prompt and push audiences to think about the world differently and to extend the terrain of political discussion in productive ways.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The performances of our testimonial play have contributed to an important transnational public sphere in which multiple 'user' communities have come together to witness, explore and debate the politics and ethics of temporary labour migration. Performances of Nanay in Manila were attended by faculty and students from Ateno de Manila, University of Sto. Thomas, University of the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon University, Polytechnic University, Miriam College, and the University of the East. Performances were also attended by the staff of ECPAT Philippines (a children's NGO), MAPUA Instititue of Technology, the director of the Eastern University, the PETA-Metropolitan Teen Theatre League, the Quezon City Office of the Vice Mayor, as well as representatives of various NGOs: Batis Center for Women, Philippine Migrant Rights Watch, Scalabrini Migration Center, Migrant Forum in Asia, National Council of Churches, KPD, and Migrante International. Further, performances and post-performance talkbacks were attended by former and current migrant workers, and the family members of domestic workers in Canada. This research has several future impacts to report. Firstly, this work has stimulated significant conversations on the effects of labour migration and family separation between migrant domestic workers in Canada and their family members in the Philippines. Secondly, as noted previously, we have shared our testimonial script with Migrante International, who are using it to develop script readings in migrant-sending communities in Manila. We will be assessing their work to explore how migrants often do not fully communicate their challenges to their relatives in the Philippines, and working with the script at a community-level allows us to communicate experiences under Canada's Live-In Caregiver Program in an intimate way to prospective migrants. Thirdly, we will document a second reading of the play organised by Hazel Venzon within the Filipino community in Whitehorse, Canada. This will be conducted at Nakai Theatre, who are exploring the possibility of a full theatrical production of Nanay during their Pivot Festival in January 2016. Knowing little about the history of Filipino migration to Canada before joining the production, the experience of Nanay has led Venzon to create a series of artistic works within the Filipino community in Whitehorse (where she now lives) in which she has used theatre to create novel forms of multicultural interaction. Her work will serve to examine the growing and understudied migration of Filipinos to and multiculturalism in the Canadian North.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6664367-DF20-4F75-BA75-F72A5472E656</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ccf9bb1b570.32051753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government,
