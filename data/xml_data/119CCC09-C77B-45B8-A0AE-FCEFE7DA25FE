Events and sports medicine is a developing pre-hospital speciality recognised worldwide as requiring further scrutiny and planning as the frequency and nature of sports and events evolve. Overall, guidance in this area for medical cover is noted as being limited.

The need for documentation from a medical and legal perspective, in addition to providing patients information and to facilitate ongoing care, is complicated by often remote location of initial care, multiple care givers and the requirement for follow-up with specialists.

By developing a digital way to record sports and events medicine consultations we will be able to improve patient outcomes in their initial treatment and future advice and follow-up. Current documentation on paper based systems is no longer fit for purpose. There is a need to retain documentation for the practitioner and also to enable communication of ongoing care requirements to both primary and secondary care. Vitally, the patient becomes an empowered stakeholder in this process.

Within general healthcare and specifically within professional sports and events this is particularly important when details of initial injury such as mechanism and initial treatment are crucial to ongoing management. The need for high quality documentation that can be shared amongst care givers and shared with the patient is an area of unmet need within sports and events medicine.

Our proposed digital technology will allow quick diagnosis, efficient recording and secure sharing of the care required should the patient need to receive ongoing treatment or be admitted into hospital. It will also reduce the demand on the healthcare system as it will allow a more integrated approach to patient transfer from a pre-hospital to hospital setting, as well as communication to the GP thus enhancing pre and post hospital inter-connectivity. Practitioners will also benefit from an advanced reporting and diagnosis system that will allow them to immediately treat and monitor the patient on each part of the treatment and recovery process.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">133401</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
