This was a major undertaking, which involved editing and producing five films; acquiring, editing and curating images and artefacts on village India; and displaying photographs of village India from the 1950s and today. We worked with designers, printers and gallery installers. 

The exhibition was free and open to the public from October until December in the largest space the gallery has to offer, around 200m. sq. Around 200 images were on display, with an equal number of associated text panels, graphics and maps. The gallery was open from 10 AM until 5 PM Tuesday to Saturday. We conducted around 20 tours of the exhibition and maintained a book for visitors.

We are currently working on a catalogue associated with the exhibition and are investigating avenues through which this material could tour to reach other publics. We held two receptions in the gallery. The press release advertising the exhibition was published by NewAsian Post, Artweek, The Wall Street Journal and numerous London listings.

Unfortunately, for much of the time the exhibition was open to the public SOAS was subject to a disruptive student occupation; unquestionably, this occupation affected the number of people visiting the exhibition, including the Opening Event which had to be cancelled at the last minute. We received a great deal of positive feedback about the exhibition. Visitors said that their impressions of what rural India was like, and the challenges it faced, and been altered by the material on display.

IMPORTANT: We are currently in negotiation with community venues in other parts of the UK about hosting the exhibition in the coming years. This is a key part of the plan for the research impact and to join South Asian community groups to UK University research on South Asia.</gtr:description><gtr:id>950697E1-BEA9-4C8F-9EF4-41B30DDA5A1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have not yet worked out the best way to transfer the contents of the book for visitors onto ResearchFish. However, I attach below some representative feedback received by email from Liana Chase, 634139@soas.ac.uk 

1. What were your overarching impressions of the exhibition? 
The exhibit was incredibly aesthetically engaging. The overall design, including the layout, the colors, and the contrast between color and black and white photos, was tasteful and visually interesting. The unusual shapes and three dimensional elements served to draw the viewer in. I had the impression that the exhibit is meant to be experienced, rather than just viewed. 

2. Did the exhibition make you think about the different ways in which it is possible to communicate anthropology? 
Definitely. I was amazed how much could be communicated not only through the content of images, but their arrangement and juxtaposition. I have always thought of &amp;quot;visual anthropology&amp;quot; in terms of film and photography; this exhibit helped me to imagine another way in which I might someday be interested in presenting my findings. 

3. Did the exhibition influence what you thought of the conditions of rural India? 
Yes. One of the most powerful parts of the exhibit for me was a shelf full of household products (hair creams etc.) which allowed what felt like a very intimate gaze into daily life in present day rural India and its tensions with the past and the imagined globalized future. I found that this setup played with the Western viewer's preconceptions, demonstrating at once connectedness to the global market and the diversity of objects sought and produced for non-Western buyers. Interestingly this part of the exhibit resonated strongly with what I saw in rural Nepal, which is also telling.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46d25304400.79123202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Future of the Rural World?

2014, 42 minutes, directed by Dakxin Bajranje Chhara and Alice Tilche

In the 1950s the anthropologist David Pocock conducted research in the village of Sundarana, central Gujarat, with a focus on the Patidar community; in 2013 we returned to see what changed. 
We find a village from where everybody aspires to emigrate.
The documentary shows how international migration has become key to ideas of status, belonging and for the village's economic and social reproduction; conversely the failure to migrate is the failure to become a recognized social person. 
The film documents the consequences of these changes by following a young man's failed attempts at emigrating and at finding a marriage partner.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A2021173-B57E-431A-97EB-5FDC71344193</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We (Alice Tilche and Edward Simpson) first screened the film at a public venue in Amsterdam to gauge audience feedback before a final edit and a series of screenings (as yet to happen) at public venues in the UK and in India.

Panel 41: Agrarian relations in contemporary rural India 
Convenors: Urs Geiser (University of Zurich); Madhura Swaminathan (Indian 
Statistical Institute); Ramakumar R (Tata Institute of Social Sciences)

Studying the agrarian question through intensive surveys of villages has been an important intellectual tradition in Indian social sciences. This panel would try to assemble survey-based studies of Indian villages in the 2000s to understand the nature of agrarian relations in rural India.
Paper: Land holdings and land distribution in contemporary Indian villages 
Deepak Kumar (Indian Statistical Institute); V.K. Ramachandran
This paper uses a unique data set from the Project on Agrarian Relations in India to investigate patterns of land holding, distribution of ownership and operational holdings of land across regions, castes and classes, and to analyse different forms of land tenure and types of tenancy relations.103

Paper: Changes in the concentration of land ownership: results from village resurveys in Maharashtra, India
Ramakumar R (Tata Institute of Social Sciences)
This paper would deal with changes in the concentration of land ownership in a set of eight villages in Maharashtra State, India. The results of the paper are drawn from a larger study of agrarian change in these eight villages between the 1950s and 2000s.

Paper: Class, caste, families, houses, and land in a western Maharashtra village: factors mediating continuity and change, 1975-2012
Lee Schlesinger (University of Michigan)
Analyzing household survey data from a Maharashtra village in 1975 and 2012, the paper examines the relationship between family composition, wealth, and status to compare various conditions mediating economic change and to recognize structural factors affecting who benefits and who suffers.

Paper: Dalit households in Indian villages
Madhura Swaminathan (Indian Statistical Institute); V.K. Ramachandran
This paper tries to address the question of caste discrimination in contemporary rural India by examining differences in a range of socio-economic variables between Dalit households and Other Caste households, based on more than 12 detailed village surveys, conducted between 2005 and 2010.

Paper: Managing land by Iphone: migration, agrarian relations and power in central 
Gujarat
*Alice Tilche (School of Oriental and African Studies)
This paper examines how different kinds of migration, and the devaluation of older agrarian identities, has affected agrarian relations and the dominance of the Patidar caste in central Gujarat.

Paper: Agrarian relations and rural change in Bisipada, Kandhamal, Odisha
*Tina Otten (SOAS)
This restudy of the village Bisipada in Highland Odisha, India, studied by F.G. Bailey in the 1950s, analyses qualitative and quantitative data regarding changed agrarian relations.

Paper: Diversification of employment and income among rural workers
Niladri Sekhar Dhar (Tata Institute of Social Sciences); Arindam Das (Foundation 
For Agrarian Studies); Aditi Dixit
We examine diversification of employment, earnings and incomes among hired manual worker households in a cross-section of Indian villages. These aspects are examined in the context of the supply of labour, labour absorption in agriculture and the prevalence of different types of wage contracts.

Paper: Some aspects of employment and labour in Eastern Vidarbha: results from the re-survey of a village
Karan Raut (Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai)
This paper is based on a re-survey of Zanjiya village in Gondia district of Maharashtra. This paper attempts to analyse some aspects of labour and employment at the level of one village between 1957 and 2007.

Paper: Toil, property and propriety: social and political dynamics of rural female labour relations in Tamil Nadu
Taneesha Mohan (London School of Economics)
Survival of labour tying arrangements, its re-enforcement and embellishment, increasingly experienced by the female agricultural class, emerges from social control and power within rural societies. Have such experiences under agrarian capitalism altered labour relations in Tamil Nadu?

Paper: The changing shape of the village and agriculture in Central India: 1950-2013
*Tommaso Sbriccoli (SOAS)
An examination of a substantial range of data 1950-2013 on patterns of work, land holding and inter-village relations.

European Association of Social Anthropologists, 31st July-3rd of August 2014 
Panel: What to do with 'old' anthropology? Zeitgeist, knowledge and time
Convenors: *Edward Simpson (SOAS); Peter Berger (University of Groningen)

This panel will ask how we should conceptualise and dwell amidst the anthropology of our ancestors. How can we collaborate with previous generations of anthropologists - living or dead - and relate to the work they produced?

Anthropology has matured as a discipline to have written histories, ancestors and identifiable phases of particular theoretical fashion. But what kind of knowledge is the 'old' anthropology of the twentieth century?

What should we do with it? How are we to understand and relate to it?

Within the discipline, some scholars stress a paradigm of innovation, newness and excitement, believing that the discipline should endlessly regenerate itself. Others rather stress continuity and the seemingly inescapable heritage of colonial forms of knowledge production and practices. Either way, the 'old' anthropology of the twentieth century has become little more than footnotes and a set of background references to things that happened before the present. Is that all it can be?

We invite papers on any intimate collaboration between contemporary researchers and 'old' anthropology.
Themes may include 'restudying' the same locations, revisiting ideas and theories, using old field notes or diaries, as well as more general conceptualisations of the production of knowledge across time.

Ethnographies as field sites: the ways of dealing with the Soviet time ethnography of Lithuania
Auksuole Cepaitiene (Lithuanian Institute of History)
The paper discusses the ways of dealing with the Soviet time ethnography of Lithuania. It suggests treating and 'reading' the ethnographies as field sites, and keeping the aspects of cultural imagination, and culture that is public next to political intentionality, knowledge production, and time.

Tour diaries, monographs and object collections: working with colonial knowledge about the Naga of northeast India
Vibha Joshi (Tuebingen University/University of Oxford)
Taking the example of the Naga of northeastrn India this paper considers the modern day impact of 'old' anthropology on the indigenous peoples who were written about and part of whose material cultural history is to be found in Western museum collections.

On collaboration with an eminent, yet unknown &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; anthropologist: revisiting field notes, field sites and ideas of J&amp;oacute;zef Obrebski
Anna Engelking (Institute of Slavic Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences)
The paper describes my collaboration with J. Obrebski, Polish anthropologist, whose achievements, innovative for his time, remained mostly unpublished. Different ethnographic revisits of his work are a testament to an inspiring dialogue between a contemporary researcher and the &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; anthropology.

Everything I need to know about (political) anthropology I learned from FG Bailey
Felix Girke (Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg)
FG Bailey's work is often condensed to his 1969 &amp;quot;Stratagems and Spoils&amp;quot;. But beyond this staple reference in political anthropology, he offers a large and coherent opus, with succinct lessons in theory and method that can arguably stand the test of time - if we care to read them.

The present in the past: an exercise in turning time upside down
*Tommaso Sbriccoli (SOAS)
Drawing on the restudy of an Indian village previously studied by the British anthropologist A. C. Mayer, this paper interrogates past and present anthropological knowledge by engaging in the methodological exercise of inverting the causal relation usually established between the two.


Communal violence and the civility of indifference
*Tina Otten (SOAS)
F.G. Bailey's work analysed through a year-long re-study conducted between 2012 and 2014

Searching for 'Pollok': anthropology in the footsteps of an ancestor
*Alice Tilche (School Of Oriental And African Studies)
This paper reflects on the fortunes and challenges of working in the footsteps of an ancestor. It raises questions on anthropologists' role in shaping the imagination, history and self-representation of a village or people, and on different styles and approaches to the discipline.

Christoph von F&amp;uuml;rer-Haimendorf and the anthropology of India
Peter Berger (University of Groningen)
What to do with 'old' anthropology? Study it! This paper is a plea for an intensive and balanced involvement with the lives and work of our academic ancestors. This paper discusses the case of Christoph von F&amp;uuml;rer-Haimendorf, why he is largely forgotten, and why this is not a fortunate situation.

'Old' German vs. 'old' English anthropology in Odisha/India: what to do with it?
Georg Pfeffer (Freie Universit&amp;auml;t Berlin)
'Old' German ethnology meant conjectural history, 'old' English anthropology was conceived as functionalism. My paper reviews and evaluates the work of Hermann Niggemeyer (Frankfurt) and F. G. Bailey (Manchester) conducted almost simultanuously during the mid-1950s among the Kond of highland Odisha/India.

Which way round? Some thoughts on second lives of ethnographic writings
Almut Schneider (Department of Anthropology, University of M&amp;uuml;nster)
This paper pleads for a multifaceted collaborative relationship with 'old' ethnographies. Avoiding the beaten tracks of contemporary views and terminologies, they seem to hold a particular potential for generating novel perspectives on contemporary issues.

Hierarchy redux
Anastasia Piliavsky (Cambridge)
In the anthropology of South Asia Dumont-and hierarchy-is but a horse not worth flogging. I argue that while Dumont's total social edifice was rightly abandoned, the removal of hierarchy from our arsenal of analytical tools obscures the relational principle of mutual dependence across differences of rank, which has not lost its force.


The foundation laid by this panel will be refined and developed further at a forthcoming conference of the Association of Social Anthropologists in 2015. This will lead to a group publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b913d71c995.29500105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DfID Briefing India 21st of November 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE96BFCA-BA69-4C9B-A035-D15F4EEF45DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Tommaso Sbriccoli had a meeting with DfID officials (Emma Spicer, Peter Evans and Jaya Singh Verma) at their offices in Delhi to discuss the aims and intentions of the ESRC-funded project.

From the outset, this research was to explore a number of intrinsically interesting issues of broader appeal and human interest: other ways of life, change, new longevity, memory, global inequality, and the lived-realities of the post-colonial world. These are expressed as tangible outputs in the original Case for Support as a 'documentary film' and as a 'photography exhibition'. 

The project has made two documentary films (we also have material for two further films) Sundarana (45 mins) and The Civility of Indifference (15 mins) and put on a major exhibition at the Brunei Gallery at SOAS, which was much larger, complicated and ambitious than our original plans: The Future of the Rural World? India's villages 1950 to 2015. The exhibition was open between October and December 2015, and we have been making plans for the exhibition to tour in 2016 and 2017 (for which additional funds are secure from other sources). 

Again, scale of the exhibition was not anticipated in the original project design but has gained an unforeseen momentum of its own. The exhibition was extremely-well received and we look forward to taking it to other audiences, alongside other events, workshops and activities. We conducted around 20 tours of the gallery, held two receptions, and maintained a visitors' book. We have also produced a substantial catalogue of the exhibition, which will be published later in 2016.

As mentioned elsewhere in the submission to ResearchFish the PI on the project Edward Simpson was due to give his professorial inaugural lecture at SOAS on 29th of October 2015 to both summarise the findings of the project and to open the exhibition at the Brunei Gallery. Unfortunately, this event was cancelled at the last moment due to the disruptive occupation/closure of SOAS by students in an unrelated protest. The organisational energy which had gone into this preparing for this event (media invitations etc) was unfortunately lost and has not yet been recouped.

However, the foundation of a resource (Exhibition materials, films and catalogue) which can tour and engage communities, school and so forth outside the academic sphere has been created and will be put to use in the coming years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD73D200-75D8-40B4-A99D-C36E9AEC0782</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dec54da299e2.00607556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have conducted new fieldwork in the villages so rigorously documented by anthropologists in the 1950s. Today, all three fieldsites (in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat) display varying legacies of post-colonial development policies, economic and land reform, and technological, corporate and media expansion.

In each location, there has been a growth of grass-roots Hindu chauvinist politics. In Odisha, land rights and tribal identities have become burning issues, as people have been brought into conflict with transnational corporations and rapacious extractive industries. Rapid industrialisation in Madhya Pradesh has brought villagers into wage relations with India's industrial houses. In Gujarat, the village has become part of the transnational networks of migration, which directly link the politics and economy of rural India to the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

Each field location displays different sociology and emergent development and cultural trends. The impossibility of a single future for rural India emerges clearly.

The trends identified in the 1950s as influencing the future direction of village life continue to define in a broad sense what village life is about:

? The role of agriculture and the material and symbolic capital of small-scale land-holding is declining.

? Livelihoods, and agricultural production, are diversifying.

? Caste hegemony remains, but other forms of ethnic and religious politics dominate daily life.

To such general trends, we add the following details:

? Mass unemployment, 'over' education, and cultures of 'waiting' are endemic. 

? Religion dominates public discourse in many locations.

? Land fragmentation is combined with speculative land and construction markets.

? Private monopolists dominate many local supply chains.

? Transnational capital has become increasingly sophisticated at extracting revenue.

? Service professions and a middle class have entered rural life.

? A mobility paradigm organises daily and life-cycle expectations for many.

In a more general sense, we have found:

? The village, however hollowed out in economic or migratory terms, is regularly evoked as a unit of political mobilization and identity.

? The strategic decisions of transnational capital strongly influences the direction of life in villages. Local governments often seem out of step with the realities which surround them; national government policy similarly reflects realities rather than defining them.

? The distinction between villages and cities appears to be collapsing, to the degree that the vocabulary of social science and public requires reworking.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project started as an attempt to understand the nature of social change in rural India in the postcolonial decades. By looking back in time and through the discovery and analysis of trends and trajectories we find that the project material is now asking us to think about the future of the rural world, more than the past. These questions are of significance to the larger share of the world population. 

This project is of interest to those working in rural India on questions of development. Here we do not simply have in mind conventional notions of development as poverty reduction or the improvement in life opportunities. The research suggests that fundamental changes are afoot for what it means to be 'rural'. The countryside is becoming something else that is neither village, nor town, but is fundamentally dependent on mobility and migration. The vast spaces between India's cities are becoming 'rurban' in their outlook and character. This has fundamental implications for what the people who live in such regions do, who they do it with and why.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>42A82A3C-0E07-4C05-8C87-0A7DEA373E38</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ba74433d052.90830696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is an online archive of the research papers of the anthropologist F.G.
