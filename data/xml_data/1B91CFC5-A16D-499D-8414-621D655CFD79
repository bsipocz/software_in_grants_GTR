The focus of our empirical work are data collected in the tri-annual Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies demographic surveillance system (DSS) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The objectives of the project are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>identify instruments to measure key indicators of the family environment that can be feasibly implemented in ongoing longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional population studies in sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>test different strategies for collecting data about families, including information about non-resident parents, non-parental caregiving and geographically mobile children&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>evaluate the validity and reliability of family data obtained from multiple respondents&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>incorporate multiple and dynamic family risk environments in statistical analyses to identify determinants of child health and wellbeing&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contribute improved measurement tools and detailed data to inform the design and evaluation of new family oriented child health interventions.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The collaboration, activities and findings from our project will impact six groups of beneficiaries: 

1.The conceptual and methodological dimensions of the project will be of considerable interest to researchers with a broad range of interests in children and families, social determinants of health, measurement and data collection methods. The project will advance knowledge about the specific dimensions of family relationships, processes, intergenerational care and support that can be used to promote child health and wellbeing.
 
2. The project will directly benefit research groups working with demographic surveillance systems in Africa and Asia (e.g. the 47 members of the INDEPTH-Network of HDSS) and family cohorts and social surveys (e.g. COHORTS) by identifying and evaluating measures of the family environment that are conceptually relevant, feasible and methodological reliable in a rural sub-Saharan African context. 

3. Improved instruments to measure key indicators of the family environment that have been shown to be feasibly implemented in individual and household data collection in a rural, sub-Sahran African population will be of value to government and international agencies engaged in national and international data collection efforts related to families and health (e.g. UNICEF, WHO, Macro/DHS, Statistics South Africa). 

4.Improved understanding of how multiple and dynamic family risk environment influence child health and wellbeing will also benefit researchers and policy-makers involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of family-orientated interventions (e.g. UNICEF, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria). 

5. Southern African early career scientists and research assistants employed through this project will directly benefit from the opportunities for capacity building afforded by the Africa Centre and the University of Southampton. Beyond gaining scientific and operational knowledge and skills within the project, the Wellcome Trust provides funding for all Africa Centre employees wishing to access additional education and training courses. 

6. The project will increase wider knowledge and understanding within social science of the value of existing data and opportunities for new data collection, not only in the Africa Centre demographic surveillance system but in the many other DSS in Africa and Asia. This project will be the first time that Berrington and Ploubidis are involved in the analysis of demographic surveillance system data. By bringing these widely respected UK-based experts' understanding of social statistics together with a well-established South African team in order to address the issue of improving measures and understanding of the family environment will serve as a catalyst for many other new areas of collaboration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>373096</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Michigan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research collaboration to examine dynamics in child care in rural South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:id>94F7F282-F65C-40C0-B916-81B95F55D066</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have obtained a travel grant which we will use to meet in early 2015.

Donors, program leaders and researchers came together to identify the necessary interventions, research, advocacy and investment required to meet the unique needs of those responsible for the unpaid care of children affected by HIV. Methodology normally used for workforce planning at national or regional levels was used to help stakeholders think about better supporting familial and other unpaid workers who care for children in the home. The meeting was intended to both feed into results presented at the Coalition's biennial symposium and, ultimately, drive action in order to reach this population.
I presented a plenary presentation on the 'Demography of the Family Careforce' in which I drew directly on findings from the ESRC-Family Environment project. The presentation was very well received by those involved with implementing, planning and funding family support programmes for children in Africa. Of particular resonance was my exploration of how best to identify and maintain support for children in highly mobile family arrangements and with multiple caregiving environments. These are challenges which face practioners but which have not been given adequate attention across the range of programmes and policies targeting parents and caregivers of children who are HIV-infected and HIV-affected.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ded318d88cb3.70019827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccaba.org/what-we-do/convenings/hiv-sensitive-care-force-planning-meeting/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hosegood V.

We can improve our measurement of the range of carework and extent of contact that mothers and fathers have with children with whom they are not living. 
Such hard-to-reach parents, if contact can be made, are more likely than resident parents to consent to participate in data collection activities; however, in a large proportion of cases where parents are not members of the same household, resident household members living with the child act as gate-keepers restricting contact. 
That increasing uptake of HIV treatment by public health service users in rural KwaZulu-Natal since 2004 has led to substantial declines in maternal and paternal mortality particularly of adults with young children. However, our analyses of longitudinal population-based data 2003-2012, shows that the level of orphaning incidence in older children remains very high and suggests that strategies to support children affected by HIV needs to adapt to the changing risk of survival post-HIV infection and meeting the needs of older adolescents and indeed, young adults during a critical period of seeking to transition from school to work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are continuing to contribute new findings and develop secondary analyses with colleagues involved in the new Healthy Adolescents and Young Adults (HAYA) Centre that is initiating intervention research in the same population, and; which is also an evaluation community for the major new initiative DREAMS that is being tested in multiple countries. In addition, our work with the Coalition for Children Affected by HIV and AIDS is being taken forward in strategy forums linked to the International AIDS conference this year. 
We have also been recently started to share our work with Dr Bernadette Daelmans, Coordinator of the WHO Policy Planning and Programmes in the Dept. of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, who is convening with colleagues gaining input from experts on how to improve the data on families in the health surveys including DHS.
