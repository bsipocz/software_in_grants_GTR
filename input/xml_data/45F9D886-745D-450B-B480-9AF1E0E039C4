Many animals have evolved to use sound for detecting prey and predators, finding and courting with potential mates, 'seeing' the world with echolocation, and reaching a level of complexity to enable speech. In many cases, having an acute auditory sense can really be a matter of life and death. Unsurprisingly, the importance of detecting the sounds emitted by friends and foe has driven the evolution of remarkable acoustic sensors. When we can hear a pin drop, we do so because that ability, a long time ago, could have saved our lives. This level of sensitivity, in humans, mammals, and insects among others has reached a point where some animals can detect sound that is in some respects only just distinguishable from noise - from the thermal buffeting to which every sensor is ultimately restricted. In order to achieve this, animals have evolved many tricks to enhance their auditory capability. Mammals and insects use sensors full of molecular motors, consuming energy to provide amplification of weak sounds that enter their ears. This feedback also gives a sensor the ability to selectively filter signals; to change the range of frequencies to which they are sensitive. In this regard, a biological acoustic sensor can be adapted perfectly to the animal's needs: to lock into the sound from a desirable mate or to form an image of their world when eyes are not enough. Insects in particular employ a wide range of exquisite sensors. For example, the mosquito uses a brush-like antenna projected away from its head into the air, which oscillates when sound is present. At the base of this antenna is some 16000 neurones (that can both sense and generate force), a truly remarkable number. Why the need for so many? Strangely enough, with so many neurones sensing and feeding back a force to the antenna, some very complex dynamic behaviour can occur. Sound can be amplified, frequencies accepted or rejected, and signals can be 'locked' to zoom in on the source.This project is inspired by these sensors. Can we learn from the way insects like the mosquito process sound? Can we harness their ability to make new sensors and actuators that can hear like they do? Over the course of this fellowship, we will investigate the way in which bundles of cells operate to achieve their exquisite sensitivity. What happens when a sensor is composed of relatively simple components, but behaves more than the sum of its parts? We will image the activity of neurones in insects and develop hypotheses on how they work collectively. We aim to proceed by searching for ways in which to implement their properties in real engineered sensors. Many transducers used industrially, and in other scientific fields, are in fact arrays of many sensors and actuators, coupled together. By knowing the mechanisms of cellular arrays in animals such as the mosquito, we will aim to achieve the level of sophistication, sensitivity and functionality of insect hearing in real systems. These bio-inspired sensors have the potential to improve the industrial use of acoustic sensors and actuators, from medical ultrasound imaging, non-destructive testing of materials, and even robot guidance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The cross-disciplinary nature of the proposed research means there are several potential beneficiaries. Aside from scientists directly interested in bioacoustics, researchers interested in mosquito control as a mechanism for disease control and prevention will benefit, in the medium to long term, from this research, as much interest already exists in the sexual interaction of males and females as a potential method for population control - audition is the primary sense for mate detection and courtship. Understanding how they hear can potentially raise new ideas of how to control them. In scope, this is clearly of international benefit, and efforts will be made to disseminate results not only to the field of insect bioacoustics, but also to researchers of, for example, malaria and yellow fever prevention, through scientific articles and attending conferences, and possibly direct collaboration with these researchers as early as possible. The University of Strathclyde has several major connections with public health bodies, via which information about the progress made in this work will be made available to clinicians and those responsible for medical policy development, as appropriate. Also in the medium to long term, industrial partners of the Host Institution will benefit in their commercial activities of non-destructive evaluation (for material testing), accurate ranging (sonar for range finding and guidance in, for example, robots) and potentially medical ultrasound (advancements in tissue imaging). This however is a higher risk: as implementing the incredible sensitivity and functionality of insect sensors into real engineered systems may not yield viable commercial products. However, peripheral processing of the type insects perform is of great interest to engineers, and during the fellowship, consultation with experts, both academic and industrial, will be undertaken to take advantage. The Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering (CUE) is ideally placed to foster communication between industrial partners (at least through its membership of UK RCNDE (United Kingdom Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation) and the Scottish Executive-sponsored Facility for Innovation and Research in Structural Testing (within Strathclyde)), and in the short to medium term, heavy consultation with industrial partners is expected. Articles will also be written in general engineering and physics journals to enhance the recognition of this type of research. Should viable commercial products become possible, and this can only be speculative, systems are in place at the Host Institution to maximise potential. The University's Research and Innovation department exists with a view to identifying and quantifying the value and optimal exploitation of intellectual property developed. The applicant will also benefit during this time through increasing the skills required to liaise successfully with the commercial sector; again, CUE is an excellent place to achieve this. Indeed, industrial engagement will potentially lead to future collaborative research projects through schemes such as Knowledge Transfer Partnerships and Strathclyde Links projects. Through collaboration with Dr Jerome Sueur, and potentially others, work resulting from the fellowship will benefit both disciplines of bioacoustics and engineering by encouraging dialogue between two fields that have a lot in common, but struggle for communication. A successful fellowship with results that impact on different fields will demonstrate the benefits of cross-disciplinary collaboration and aid closer connections, both in the UK and abroad. The candidate Dr Joseph Jackson is ideally placed to achieve these goals, as evidenced by his excellent publication record in diverse fields, and his ability to work in different scientific environments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237237</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Strathclyde Studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Strathclyde</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>76D0F6B3-6135-4324-82A5-EAF0E3E92D87</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de9beaa88c83.08330100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Changes in the design of ultrasonic transducers has increased the awareness and use of 2D ultrasonic arrays in industrial contexts, where my work has contributed to feasible and novel array designs to be used for non-destructive evaluation.
