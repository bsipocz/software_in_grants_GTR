Improvements were obtained through exploration of both physical factors (laser type/power, lenses, gratings, filters, dichroic mirrors, collimators, PMT type, capillary type), and signal processing algorithms. A working optical bench and investigation of fundamentals on measurement sensitivity and accuracy was delivered on time using BSA and FKBP proteins.



A new confocal stage mounting for accurate alignment of an IR laser to induce heating of buffers within a microfluidic channel was created and a time-dependent 3D temperature profile determined by confocal microscopy using a temperature sensitive fluorescent dye. This provided accurate information on the temperature gradients, rate of thermal diffusion and the effective beam width of the IR laser in the channel. Various configurations of IR power and capillary flow rates have been investigated to control heating rate, create temperature gradients, and constant temperature profiles within the channel. The system was simulated in Comsol to improve fundamental understanding and to assist the design of improved microfluidic chips with integrated IR induced heating at single or multiple points along the channel. Temperature gradients with a 70&amp;deg;C range across 0.1-1 mm channel lengths were obtained, as well as constant temperatures of 20-98&amp;deg;C across 0.5mm, which can be established in ms timescales. 

Throughput of data collection and processing was significantly improved with emissions for each laser pulse (at 1kHz) collected to a PC at 10E8 datapoints per second and processed in Labview. We developed signal processing algorithms to remove time-dependent variation of the laser pulse and to reduce the prompt scattered light signal. The detection limits for fluorescence intensity in the capillary (10E5 molecules) were compared to our microplate-based method (10E11 molecules). Equilibrium urea denaturation with the new technique was applied to BSA, FKBP-12 wt and an FL99 mutant to demonstrate application to different protein types and to an engineered variant with lower stability. The latter two were tested also in the presence of the drug rapamycin which binds to FKBP-12. These gave accurate unfolding dG and rapamycin Kd values consistent with literature measurements. This work has now been submitted for publication. This technique has great potential for both high-throughput drug screening in addition to biopharmaceutical formulation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The technique can be employed in standalone analytical instruments for rapid protein library screening of stability, or potentially for ligand affinity in microfluidic systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>84E6CCF8-8049-403F-95BB-C5A959F7096C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2657645580.039961774f995a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Steering Group Member of the BBSRC Bioprocess Research Industry Club (BRIC)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC1865DF-E8B9-4FE8-8C39-5BFAD5BB2838</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The BRIC committee oversees research projects funded at the academic industry interface in bioprocessing, training events for PhD students and early careers researchers, and network events for the wider community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5878b2cae145b2.52573103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a new optical detection system capable of detecting the presence of, and quantifying the relative contributions of multiple protein species within a single sample, including the analysis of chromatographic peaks in real time.
