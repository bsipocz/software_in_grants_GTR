CARE International reported that most residential buildings in the area had been built from random rubble masonry walls with flat timber joists covered in earth, and that anecdotal evidence suggests there were more casualties where heavy roof structures were used but more survivors in buildings with light roofs. The development and charity organizations have reported shelter provision being an acute problem after the disaster. As a result people continue to live in congested and unhealthy refugee camps. The relief tents provided are reported to be totally inadequate for the harsh winter of the Kashmir region of Pakistan and India.Pakistan has no tradition of using light timber trusses for roofs, unlike most countries in the west where roof construction is standardized This is in part due to the fact that timber is not as easily available, as compared to countries in more northerly latitudes, and hence relatively expensive. More importantly, the technology for roof trusses does not exist and timber roofs used locally consist of rough-sawn timber as simply supported horizontal joists. Further, although slates are widely available, especially in these northern areas of Pakistan, they are not used as a roofing material.This project proposes to investigate and develop an appropriate roof truss technology for Pakistan. It will focus on using locally available material and skills. Some options for roof truss construction to be considered are:- The use of plywood sheets (typically available in 2400 x 1200 sheets in thickness of 12mm and 18mm) cut to suitable sections, glued, nailed together to construct rafters and ties (plywood is manufactured within the country).- The use of mild steel L, Z and T sections appropriately welded to form roof trusses. - The use of galvanized steel sheets manually formed to shape (cold rolled steel sections are not available in Pakistan).Other materials may also be considered if deemed appropriate to the local environment. An advantage of using plywood would be its inherent strength allowing very light sections to be fabricated, and that it can be assembled from sections that are relatively easy to transport. Furthermore it would reduce the likelihood of local trees being forested in an environmentally detrimental way. The component materials would need to be tested, and a suitable truss designed for suitable loadings. Cost and appropriate technology would be the two key factors to determine suitability. These roof trusses would then be tested with slates as roofing material (as opposed to corrugated galvanized sheet) for their appropriateness to local skills and conditions.This research project would deliver appropriate standards and appropriate literature for the construction and installation of safe, lightweight roof trusses. Introducing slates as a roofing material may stimulate a local industry, replacing the more expensive corrugated galvanized iron sheeting, which is either imported or produced in the large towns/cities. If funding were available from ESPRC and/or other sources, the research project would include building a demonstration prototype in the area. This research project proposes to deliver its objectives in a three phased approach:Appropriate Roof Truss Technology I: Network and ScopingAppropriate Roof Truss Technology II: Research and DevelopmentAppropriate Roof Truss Technology III: Dissemination and Monitoring This Overseas Travel Grant Application covers the first phase of this project. A second Responsive Mode application will be made to EPSRC for Phase II under the EPSRC and International Development Research remit. Funding for Phase III will be made possibly to EPSRC, DfID, Bomford Trust etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-11-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11135</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E013295/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>153EEBDB-0E76-4210-9687-2E4C43AE8DFF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
