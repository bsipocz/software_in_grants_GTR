&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Understanding human behaviour: 
The proposed research is concerned with the ontogenetic development of punishing behaviour and ultimately deals with the mechanisms that support the emergence of human moral behaviour. This proposal thus directly contributes to one of the ESRC's main strategic objectives: Understanding human behaviour and its relationship to social determinants. 

2. Interdisciplinarity:
The proposed project interconnects research in developmental, experimental, and social psychology and experimental economics in a novel way. It combines theories and methods from psychology, economics, and evolutionary theory. In that sense, it promises to advance knowledge in these disciplines.

3. Contribution to policy and practice:
The question of how to promote positive social and moral behaviour and discourage anti-social and aggressive behaviour among the UK's children and youth is one of the re-occurring topics among practitioners and government, particularly after the riots in the summer of 2011. In order to design and provide adequate intervention programs for children and adolescents, it is important to understand the factors that affect and support social and moral behaviour across development. Punishment represents one of the key mechanisms through which social and moral norms are maintained in human societies. The results of this research will therefore have direct relevance for teachers, educators, and program developers and administrators who try to foster positive youth development and well-being.
The notion that attentional control processes are central to the regulation of (negative) emotions paves the way for application to societal challenges. Simple interventions, such as inducing attentional load, temporarily block emotion processing and may thus ameliorate negative emotions before they take full swing. Such attentional load manipulations could be successfully applied in legal decision-making.

Exploitation and Application
Impact on the users identified above will be achieved in a number of ways. Teachers, parents, and charitable organizations can access information about our research via the investigators' websites. A summary of the findings and methods of the proposed project will be featured in one of the newsletters sent out by the Developmental Group at the School of Psychology to schools and key stakeholders in the local community. We will present the findings of the proposed project to parents and teachers at the participating schools, and we anticipate writing at least one non-technical report for non-academic beneficiaries. Additionally, our findings will be disseminated at both nationally (BPS Developmental Section) and internationally (EASP, SRCD) recognized conferences and through six peer-reviewed papers.

Collaboration
The investigators have strong collaborative links to psychological, economic, and interdisciplinary research groups in the UK, Europe, North-America, and Asia. The principle investigator has a proven publication track record in investigating the moral and economic behaviour of children and adolescents with these collaborators. All investigators have a proven track record of publishing their research in high-impact journals in developmental, social, experimental, and psychophysiological areas.

Capability
The principal investigator will serve as project leader and coordinator for the proposed research. All investigators and the research assistant will contribute to the dissemination of results as academic papers, non-academic reports, newsletters, and conferences. Furthermore, research findings will be disseminated through the investigators' wide network of national and international collaborators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251919</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit, Leiden University, NL</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>244B8AA3-E957-449F-A51B-2DBCD0F89707</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 40 undergraduate and postgraduate students and academics attended a visit and presentation by the PI which sparked questions and discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bc7627e402f0.68130377</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit, University of Surrey</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27A2B657-0E9A-41F6-AC16-4E43A9104364</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation was given at the Psychology Research Seminars.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d42f99d9b272.63435613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public engagement - Plymouth Humanists</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF6BB48A-9BC0-4237-931B-7F8D61DC6B57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>about 40 members of the public attended a presentation given to the Plymouth Humanists.

The violation of these norms is often accompanied by negative feelings and punishment. The aim of this project was to investigate in six interrelated studies how altruistic punishment develops over the course of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood and the emotional and cognitive processes underlying punishment. Ultimately, this project aspired to provide a novel understanding of how mechanisms supporting the emergence and maintenance of moral behavior develop over human ontogeny.

Altruistic punishment can has been regarded as costly behaviour by a punisher that sanctions a norm violator. This project drew on experimental economic methods to assess costly punishment, namely the ultimatum game and the third-party punishment game. The ultimatum game studies the costly punishment of the victim of a fairness violation (i.e., second-party punishment); the third-party punishment game measures the costly punishment of a violator by an unaffected third party (i.e., third-party punishment). 

In two studies we investigated how integral negative emotions that arise as part of the decision-making situation predicted costly punishment. These negative emotions were assessed through galvanic skin responses (GSR) and explicit emotion ratings. Punishment in the ultimatum game was predicted by both changes in GSR and emotion ratings in children, adolescents, and adults. However, contrary to our predictions, third-party punishment was not associated with negative emotions, but was mainly predicted by the degree of unfairness of the violator's transgression. 
In four studies, we further assessed the role of incidental anger on the second- and third-party punishment and third-party compensation. Incidental emotions, which are triggered in one situation and &amp;quot;carry over&amp;quot; and bias behaviours or decisions in other, unrelated situations, can shed light on the emotional and cognitive processes underlying people's decisions. These studies found that participants in an incidental anger condition punished more than participants in a neural condition in both second- and third-party punishment situations, and this effect could be found in all age groups. In third-party compensation situations, in which the third party compensates the victim instead of punishing the violator, angry participants compensated less than those in a neutral condition. In a follow-up study, incidental self-focused anger was indeed associated with decreased third-party compensation, whereas incidental other-focused (empathic) anger was associated with increased third-party compensation. This suggests that the appraisal of incidental emotions is key when third parties decide whether to intervene on behalf of others.

Furthermore, this project investigated whether attentional control processes regulate how negative emotions affect punishment by disengaging attention from negative information and thoughts. Across four studies we showed that loading adults' attention with an activity that interferes with sustained processing of (negative) emotions decreases the effect of negative emotions on punishment. However, when mentioning attentional control skills with questionnaires, the results are less clear-cut, mainly due to the varying reliability of our attentional control measures in the different age groups. We therefore suggest that suggest that attentional control should be manipulated experimentally in future studies that want to assess the relationship between attention and emotion processing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project could be applied to find solution to more applied, real-world problems. First, many bullying episodes include bullies, victims, but also unaffected bystanders. Understanding what motivates unaffected by standers to act can have important implications for targeting bullying.
Second, studying the role of incidental anger and attention focus might have applied relevance in legal contexts. Third-parties, such as judges or juries, regularly have to make decisions about punishing a perpetrator or compensating the victim of a crime. They are also frequently presented with emotionally arousing materials (e.g., witness or victim statements, crime scene photographs) that have the potential to carry over and bias subsequent judgments. The current research has the potential to inform the legal system in understanding when and how incidental anger affects third-party punishment and compensation, and how to counter the effects of incidental anger.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF7B52D8-47DD-40E0-9B0C-DB222131E868</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d4322537a471.67762840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>96960241-7703-493A-A863-9F29BE2611FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Costly third-party interventions: The role of incidental anger and attention focus in punishment of the perpetrator and compensation of the victim</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6efa949119eb0fdf14f26cbdb6cb3fbd"><gtr:id>6efa949119eb0fdf14f26cbdb6cb3fbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gummerum M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d533f4e7732.09594486</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63221BE0-E414-43E8-B18C-30A4CFF4A918</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interpersonal emotion regulation in Asperger's syndrome and borderline personality disorder.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The British journal of clinical psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/877d3b94548de66a64356479bdefab80"><gtr:id>877d3b94548de66a64356479bdefab80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>L?pez-P?rez B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0144-6657</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c135c45ffa16.99294580</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C8EC9F70-63A3-4326-862E-2DFCF8C4B19F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cruel to Be Kind: Factors Underlying Altruistic Efforts to Worsen Another Person's Mood.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychological science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/877d3b94548de66a64356479bdefab80"><gtr:id>877d3b94548de66a64356479bdefab80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>L?pez-P?rez B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0956-7976</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350d6e28d793.75497505</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D83F909-170D-4AD5-999E-A377BC05F6B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Virtual Morality: Transitioning from Moral Judgment to Moral Action?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37b00e819c3748e5d893605d9a085746"><gtr:id>37b00e819c3748e5d893605d9a085746</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Francis KB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c133e1d421c8.62943209</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K000942/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
