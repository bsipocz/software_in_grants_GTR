Quod</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/R009775/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Corpus Quod will bring together researchers in sociology (Charles Leddy-Owen), digital technologies (Fred Charles) and theatre (Joanna Bucknall), as well as creative economy partners (Stand+Stare, DifferencEngine &amp;amp; The Lab Collective) and public-sector organisation ArtReach, to design a 3-part prototype immersive and interactive experience. This project responds to the call's focus on the challenges presented for Memory and Performance about uncovering and documenting heritages, by developing strategies to engage audiences in new ways. The project is also concerned with developing new approaches to immersive performance experience and ways of documenting and assessing its consumption. Using existing research of RAS experiences in the UK, the team will compile a dossier of case studies that explicate the common experience of RAS pre- and post-Brexit. The case studies will be 'brought to life' through integrating theatrical dramaturgical strategies and digital immersive technologies. The immersive prototype experience will present an opportunity for the RAS heritage to be encountered in an interactive manner. The immersive performance prototype will not only be designed to provide access to RAS experience in a (syn)aesthetic manner, it will also serve to capture the audience-participant's attitudes towards RAS and the UK-based asylum process. Through innovations in hybrid immersive performance dramaturgies, the research will generate an interactive archive of post-Brexit perceptions of RAS experience and processes. The digital technologies that will be integrated into the experience will have the capacity to trace any shifts in attitudes generated by participation in the immersive experience. Mapping those shifts in attitude will create an interactive archive that evidences the potential of immersive performance to affectively shift perception.

The project will develop innovations in the production of performance by combining AR digital technologies with theatrical immersive dramaturgical This will create innovation by integrating digital technologies into live performance to generate a more comprehensive (syn)aesthetic experience for the audience-participant than either approach can offer in isolation at present. The project will generate innovations by using hybrid immersive performance as a way of providing access to archival heritage documents in a corporeal manner. The project will devise a new approach to widening access to a currently hidden heritage-bringing it to new and potentially resistant audiences. The project will bring fresh approaches in reception theory and the documentation of audience experience. The prototype immersive performance will imbed interactive technological mechanisms for documenting the audience-participant's experience as a part of the experience itself. The development of a (syn)aesthetically informed approach to capturing audience's experience will have implications far beyond the scope of the research project. The Corpus Quod project team will design a 3-part prototype, hybrid immersive performance experience in order to capture audience-participants attitudes towards RAS in the UK, along with their perception of the UK Asylum process. Secondly, the immersive experience will give the audience-participant access to the common RAS experiences of that asylum-seeking process in an interactive, affective manner. The teams prototype will put the audience-participant inside the experience of that legal and bureaucratic procedure from the perspective of RAS. The prototype immersive experience will be able to re-capture the audience-participant's attitudes towards RAS and UK Asylum process, post-immersive experience. Integrated digital technologies will be employed to map any impact that the performance experience might have had on those attitudes. It will also integrate the collection of audience-participant feedback on their perception of experience itself as an affective form of performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will build routes to social impact by (i) generating informed and evidenced representations of RAS experience (ii) designing empathetic access to that RAS heritage for public engagement (iii) generating an accessible, positive site for reflecting on attitudes towards the Asylum-Seeking processes in the UK. An important aspect of the project will be to identify possible routes to impact for the research outcomes and begin to establish the relationships with individuals and organisations that are able to support and facilitate those routes. We will work with three different user groups to ensure that those routes to impact are realised:
(1) ArtReach will be involved in the research project from its inception. They will attend the project meetings, review the prototype development process, beta-test the immersive experience prototype and work towards planning for the next phase of the research activity beyond the initial scope of this first phase of the project. They have an established a position in UK Cultural practice that already works to unite the academy, the creative industries and third-party sector work. Their involvement in the research project will be to ensure that those relational discursive channels remain open and dynamic; directly impacting upon the concerns that inform the design of the prototype. They will serve as a conduit for identifying and connecting the emergent research practices with potential non-academic beneficiaries. ArtReach's support of the research project in his way will help to consolidate third sector confidence in the integrity of the research which will be essential in preparing for the second phase of the research.
(2) Third party sector organisation, Friends without Borders will be invited to participate in the beta-testing event in both London. They will be presented with the opportunity to test and offer feedback on the potential of the immersive experience prototype as a future prototype user. An important part of the project will be to building relationships with the its non-academic beneficiaries. The London beta-testing event and reception will be a chance to invite possible third-party sector beneficiaries to experience the work and offer their feedback. It will provide the opportunity to establish confidence with understandably cautious potential third-party organisations collaborators. Charles Leddy-Owen has worked for over 20 years with FWB and in that capacity, has built up trust with other organisations such as the British Red Cross, who will be invited to the beta-testing and incentivised by the networking reception that will follow the beta-test. 
(3) The immersive creative industry is London-centric and it is this factor that has influenced in part our decision to beta-test in London. Corpus Quod will pioneer new approaches to augmenting reality in live performance, which will contribute significantly to the contemporary performance landscape. If these new developments in performance practice are to be exploited for their creative and commercial application, then they need to be disseminated in an industry setting. The London beta-testing will not only serve to generate proof-of-concept data sets, they will also introduce the prototype experience to some key industry professionals. Theatre Deli is a leading organisation in the field of immersive theatre and carries weight in their support of projects. Hosting at Caf&amp;eacute; Deli will invest the event with validation and confidence among the immersive community which will encourage industry participation in the testing of the work. We will invite producers, investors and theatre makers to the London beta-testing with the intention of securing collaborations for the second phase of the research. Joanna Bucknall has already made strong connections with the London immersive scene through her research activity over the last five years and podcast that the team can utilise.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R009775/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>87A865C6-1151-4169-B57A-6B39807A3BE2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Intelligent Measurement Sys.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E420B429-253A-4597-91E9-199D86682755</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
