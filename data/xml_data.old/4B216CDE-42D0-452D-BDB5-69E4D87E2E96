Defining culture as artistic production and a way of life, both of which condition and shape national identity, the proposed research will explore the impact of the Greek economic crisis by looking at literary, visual arts and performance-based production, as well as the wider cultural developments in Greece since the fall of the junta in 1974, with special emphasis on the last five years (2008-2013). 

Many people are experiencing the Greek crisis in economic terms and the media has tended to concentrate on this aspect, but it is important to recognize its cultural repercussions taking into account both the prospective view (i.e. as it unfolds) and the retrospective (i.e. tracing its roots). To arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the current Greek crisis presupposes reviewing the cultural developments and identity controversies experienced in Greece since 1974 in order to assess the deeper social and cultural changes the country has undergone. During this period issues of identity and social cohesion have increasingly come to the fore as a result of EU membership, the gradual multicultural transformation of Greek society due to migration and reconsideration of Greece's Balkan and Ottoman legacies. Thus the starting point for this project is that the Greek crisis cannot be understood unless we take the above developments into account and reassess their cultural and sociopolitical impact. 

The proposed network will go on to address the impact of the crisis on Greek attitudes to Europe, cultural institutions and the national imaginary. It will also explore literary, artistic and visual representations of the crisis and how perceptions of the past are challenged by the current crisis. The connection between cultural and identity politics will be highlighted through an interrogation of the cultural ideology of the Golden Dawn party and its promotion of notions of ethnic and cultural purity. 

By placing the Greek crisis in a wider transnational context, this project will invite comparisons with other economic crises in southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. Like Greece both countries emerged from dictatorships and joined the EU at much the same time. There are comparative economic data for these countries but there is little on cultural attitudes and increasing scepticism regarding closer European integration. 

The project will be multi-institutional, involving colleagues from different disciplinary areas and three continents (Europe, America and Australia), who are conducting research on Greece but are also familiar with other crises in Europe and elsewhere. It will create a forum for exchanging ideas and will engage scholars, journalists, artists, students and interested members of the community in assessing the scale and broader cultural impact of the crisis. Participants will be invited to give talks, take part in workshops or contribute short pieces to a website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A cultural perspective can foster a better understanding of the crisis and help policy-makers and economists take more serious account of cultural parameters in explaining the origins and consequences of the crisis. Such an approach will enhance understanding on the part of governmental and non-governmental organizations of the deeper impact of social precariousness and phenomena such as increasing youth participation in radical protest movements. It will also offer opportunities for a better understanding of how the crisis feeds into the cultural ideology of extreme parties such as Golden Dawn in Greece and leads to the advocating of ethnic purity and closed borders. The publications resulting from this project will make the case that policy-makers and EU and IMF officials should pay more attention to the cultural and historical specificities of the countries they wish to rescue or reform. The website link and publication details of the edited volume, for instance, will be sent to a number of policy-makers to ensure maximum publicity. It is expected that these officials will come to understand how the crisis has fostered increasing Euroscepticism and turned Greeks from fervent Europhiles into Eurosceptics. It is vitally important for policy-makers to understand how increasing Euroscepticism in Greece and other countries could impede further European integration and the promotion of the sense of a European identity. 

Furthermore, this project will offer insights into how cultural institutions, museums and publishers develop new strategies to cope with the lack of public funding and the drop in their income. Non-governmental organisations, charities and cultural foundations will be able to use the findings of this research to review their supporting strategies or the planning of their cultural activities and projects. Journalists and artists will be invited to contribute short pieces on their personal experience of the crisis to the website and offer their own reading of its cultural repercussions. The project website will offer young Greek professionals nominated by network members, after an interview, the opportunity to record their experiences of moving to another country and adjusting to a new cultural context as a result of the crisis. They will be invited to reflect on how their sense of identity has been impacted by the experience of migration and on their current relationship with their home country. By inviting colleagues in Modern Greek Studies from all over the world to contribute reflective comments or short articles to the project's website and make comparisons with the cultural impact of socioeconomic crises in other countries, this project will add a global dimension to our understanding of these crises and their cultural repercussions. All contributions to the website will be reviewed by the PI and Co-I and other members of the networking team. These website postings and our collaboration with the Hellenic Centre in London (organisational partner and a leading diaspora hub in the UK) will help Greek diaspora community leaders in the UK and elsewhere understand the cultural needs of the new emerging diaspora communities. The website will offer young professionals an incentive to develop new diasporic networks and reflect on their new sense of identity and community which will not only benefit their personal development but help to make such transitions easier for those who follow in their footsteps.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24791</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Greece in Crisis: Culture and the Politics of Austerity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCC93373-E301-4D84-8D26-F23C106CF695</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Greece in Crisis: Culture and the Politics of Austerity

This second workshop was well attended and a number of people from outside Birmingham and the UK came and contributed to the discussion. The speakers and discussants were academics (including early career ones), artists, journalists and research students. The objectives of this workshop were to investigate:
? how contemporary Greek literature, performing arts and cinema are responding to the Greek economic crisis; 
? the extent to which the economic crisis has led to an interrogation of established artistic and literary practices;
? the impact of the economic crisis on cultural institutions, media, festivals and publishers, and the proliferation of online cultural journals and dedicated blogs during this period;
? how modes of intellectual engagement have changed due to the crisis;
? how notions of cultural purity and perceptions of the ancient past have informed identity claims.

The abstracts and video recordings of some of the sessions are available on the project's website http://culpolgreekcrisis.com/. The programme of the workshop is listed below:

The fact that this workshop took place at the Hellenic Centre in London and the fact that it was widely publicised through the Hellenic Centre's distribution network and website gave members of the general public the opportunity to attend. All the sessions were also recorded and the videos are available on the project's website http://culpolgreekcrisis.com/. This workshop provided the wider framework of the project and prepared the way for another two workshops, one in Birmingham and the other in Oxford. 


The workshop was advertised through the London based website

The previous day (16 March 2016) the research students of Oxford University organized a workshop on 'Renegotiating History in the light of the 'Greek Crisis&amp;quot; which involved researchers from various universities inside and outside the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a30c92930e37.25913206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://culpolgreekcrisis.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through its two workshops and contributions to its website the project has explored the impact of the crisis on various areas of Greek cultural life such as book production, literature, cinema, media, heritage, festivals, street art and attitudes to the past. There are two key findings as a result of the project. First, that there has been an explosion of creativity in spite of the constraints imposed by austerity on cultural institutions and agents (e.g. museums, theatres and book production). Secondly, that there has been a 'revisiting' of the past as a source of support and as a means of historical understanding and framing of the crisis. Some of these findings have already been described on the project's website; others will be published in research papers after the end of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have developed contacts with other research projects, academics, artists and cultural agents in three continents and shared ideas about the cultural impact of the economic crisis and the politics of austerity with them. Using a questionnaire available on the project's website we have also surveyed a number of young expatriate Greek professionals who have sought employment abroad about their attitudes to the crisis and the challenges they have faced in their host environments. Respondents to the questionnaire included diaspora Greeks in the UK and other European countries as well as Australia. For this purpose, we have been in touch with the New Diaspora project, an online platform designed to host mini documentaries and all kinds of user-generated content revolving around the experiences of new Greek diasporas. We plan to maintain the website and build on the project's findings beyond September 2016 when the current project ends.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5946AAA5-4338-473F-91A4-46C61D0B5CAC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c1b70dbacef6.66159020</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://culpolgreekcrisis.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D947AE3-FB1B-4FFF-BD69-3AAD00F48D51</gtr:id><gtr:title>From junta to crisis: modernization, consumerism and cultural dualisms in Greece</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37d3edb691b95430458f103ae0715db2"><gtr:id>37d3edb691b95430458f103ae0715db2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tziovas D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0307-0131</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a35091a150fe8.21635901</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28573ABB-C75C-42C0-A27E-22E6EB252E49</gtr:id><gtr:title>Greece in Crisis: The Cultural Politics of Austerity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e7131c408854b7514cb99dd78e895288"><gtr:id>e7131c408854b7514cb99dd78e895288</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tziovas Professor Dimitris</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781784538453</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7989c07cadf6.41800284</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L01498X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD9F0C26-AA57-4235-8010-AEBAF429C756</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3EA5AAEC-135B-436C-8F77-F32CCCA7FF8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
