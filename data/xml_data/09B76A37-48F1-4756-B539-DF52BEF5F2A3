The discussions will pay particular attention to how the senses and emotional perceptions are evoked in urban environments and to how they can be understood and researched from different disciplinary perspectives such as history, sociology, geography, or museum studies as well as from different professional perspectives such as urban planning, urban marketing or museum curation. By doing so we hope to show how research on the senses helps to understand the relationship between history, personal experiences and feelings of attachments in a multicultural European context. 

We will organise four meetings (three workshops and one international conference) in three European cities: London, Cologne and Barcelona to compare urban experience and connect European scholars and urban professionals from diverse fields such as city museum curators, urban planners and urban marketing specialists. There will be a core steering group of academics and urban professionals which will help to identify key areas to discuss and we will invite a range of local and European participants to each of these workshops. The aim of the workshops is to bring together a diversity of experts working on the city and to explore together, existing and new methods to research and represent the sensory emotional realm in cities. To do so the workshops will have an 'active research day' component during which participants will have to trial different methods to research the sensory realm in a particular street in each city. From the discussions in the workshops an online 'toolkit' will be created on a website that both professionals and the general public will be able to access on their mobile phones as they walk around the city. This toolkit will provide resources and pilot case studies for each city that illustrate some of the sensory methods discussed and developed throughout the workshops.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the network is to bring together for the first time academics, urban professionals and city museum curators across Europe to discuss how to research, represent and curate the sensory-emotional experience of daily urban life.

Policy-makers, local government: 
The interactive website built during the project will make available a toolkit of sensory research methods to research citizens' attachments to urban environments. We expect that this toolkit will help urban policy makers and local governments across Europe to gather qualitative data about what environmental features are important markers of place attachment and emotional well-being for a diverse citizenry. To put it simple, sensory research methods are a unique tool to gather how to turn a space into a meaningful place. The research network findings will offer particular insights into how contemporary European multicultural cities demand particular frameworks of interaction.

Commercial/private sector (urban branding/marketing/architecture):
The urban marketing and branding sector plays now a crucial role in shaping the urban economy and in attracting visitors and investment into the city. The lived urban experience provides the 'raw material' on which to base their campaigns. At the same time these urban professionals research and display what they view as the marketable sensescapes of the city. This network presents an opportunity for 
a) closer discussion of these processes from a variety of views
b) a comparative evaluation of such methods across distinct cities in Europe in order to share existing approaches and generate new ways of researching the sensory-emotional landscapes of cities. 

Third sector/charities/museums:
Museums are constantly looking for new ways of making exhibitions more interactive and experientially relevant to the general public. The resources and information gathered from the research network on the interactive mobile website and edited book collection will offer a valuable resource for museums to experiment with new curational formats. We also envisage that charities involved with a spectrum of disabled groups will find the findings useful to galvanise policy support for more accessible cities or as a repository to conduct their own research on experiencing the urban realm. 

Local communities/wider public:
The interactive webpage will be available to the general public to download on their phone or tablet and will allow the public to access in new ways the urban realm. 

Additionally, any peer-reviewed publications arising from this grant will be registered on Brunel University's open access institutional repository: BURA which is ranked 7th in the UK by the Ranking Web of Repositories. In 2014 there have been 14,034,444 downloads performed to date.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36198</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Sensory Cities THiNK-KiT makes a case for the importance of interdisciplinary and cross-professional investigation of urban sensing. It brings together in the form of a digital tool methods and resources for researching, designing, curating and representing the senses in the city, drawing on the reflections of the &amp;quot;Sensory Cities&amp;quot; international research network, which involved academics, artists and urban professionals across Europe to discuss and exchange methodological approaches.
The site does not contain findings per se but offers a range of practical approaches and suggestions to researching urban experiences that emerged from discussions in the network. It is above all a 'think-kit' to frame the exploration of the urban sensorium and the design and implementation of research for planning, curation and education.
You can navigate the site either thematically or by different profesional interests such as: academic, planners and urban professional, museum curators or sensory education section. We also added a 'public' section where we have some suggestion for making sensory walks for the general public which requires no prior knowledge.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1055EFEC-A51F-4B62-A8FE-9319F9AA1236</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The think-kit will be launched on the 24th of March 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9aded6a0f21.36291951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Sensory Think-kit - an online tool to research the senses in urban environments</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://sensorythinktank.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Museum of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Museum of London has agreed to collaborate on a 6 month pilot study: &amp;quot;Sensory Explorations of West Smithfield&amp;quot; to apply some of the discussions generated from the network on their future relocation site.</gtr:description><gtr:id>320C0EE7-1071-49F3-BAC4-2D7923A018DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration will start in May 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9ab05b48e08.06447304-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>A 21st century city museum cannot neglect the sensory dimensions neither in its curatorial practice nor of its city. To connect the MoL to the surrounding streets and people the MoL has now a unique opportunity to make West Smithfield market history visible and tangible by explicitly focusing on its existing sensory landscape and engagements. City museums are locations to enable debates about the decoding and recoding of place meanings (for instant by portraying migration as both a historical and recurrent phenomenon to offer reflection on a present of future process that is reshaping the city). The relocation of the MoL to West Smithfield provides a unique opportunity to analyse the existing site from a sensory perspective to identify its current identity and atmosphere and also examine how the future is envisaged through the architects plans and CGIs. 

The objectives and benefits will discussed in collaboration with the needs of MoL, suggestions include: 
- provide a experiential map on the current site, a record of the feelings, atmospheres, 'the soft infrastructure of West Smithfield and surroundings that the MoL might not have time to collect itself; 
- write a report on the findings that can be used by the MoL to inform its curatorial practices or used to create an information page on its webpage;
- the possibility to develop with Brunel an online exhibition that could provide historical information of the site as well as the planned development; 
- use the pilot design a more extensive research grant proposal, possibly in conjunction with the Museum of London, about the redevelopment of West Smithfield and how to integrate the site and area in curatorial practices.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The senses are crucial in curatorial practices by city museums as they are sites of embodied sensory knowledge. City museums not only reflect the development of the urban form but, moreover, they capture the lived experience of the city as its political, economic and social conditions transform over time. The reliance of museums on visually led curation has been challenged by an awareness of the importance of non-visual senses and to create more participatory multisensory experiences with visitors. However, no city museums has so far explicitly focused on the sensory transformation of the city through urban redevelopment and the multiple layers of historical and contemporary narratives that can be told. 

The MoL relocation in 2022 to West Smithfield provides an exciting opportunity to focus on the ways urban change will transform the sensory identity of the current West Smithfield site and to consider how this will be incorporated in the museum's design and exhibition spaces. Through discussions that have evolved through the AHRC funded Sensory Cities Research Network we are suggesting to undertake, in collaboration with MoL, an analysis of the past, present and future sensory landscapes of West Smithfield. The aim of this pilot research study will be to start mapping the sensory landscape of the current market site (inside and outside) in relation to its future regeneration. This sensory mapping will allow understanding West Smithfield social and urban history and how the past gets reworked into the future. 

Some of the research questions include: 
1) Which traces of sensory social history can be mapped and recorded within and around West Smithfield and how might they connect to the present and future of the city?
2) How can the multiple atmospheres of the current site (e.g. dereliction, creativity &amp;amp; transformation) be captured and integrated into the MoL gallery space? 
3) What is the current 'identity of West Smithfield' and how will this be integrated and/or changed through its integration into a museum?

After gaining ethical clearance from Brunel University a mixed-methods approach will be used: sensory ethnography (including photography and recordings); 15 evocative interviews with surrounding residents, business owners (snowballing access) and architects (after accessed is granted by MoL); visual analysis of architects CGIs and secondary literature research to be conducted by the appointed research fellow in collaboration with MoL and the applicants. The collected material will be used to provide a report for MoL, write academic articles and prepare a more extensive research proposal.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cologne AHRC Sensory Cities Networking Workshop February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AFAEDD5-6C90-4E6A-AA2E-31CD2D03B4E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>27 participants attended the 2nd Sensory Cities networking workshop in Cologne.

On the 2nd day we did an active fieldwork day with about 16 participants of the participants. We devised hands on method exercises and each group had to work in the field for 3 hours. In the afternoon each group reported their findings. This was experienced as a very interesting and fruitful exercise. Academics and practitioners worked together and discussed their different methodological approaches to the senses. Especially the museum curators and architect reported that they are integrating a sensory approach in their future working practices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd747f5e93f4.74779610</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sensorycities.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newspaper article: 'K?lle, wie ist dein Gef?hl?

This was in part determined by questions emerging from the discussions in London and Cologne as well as the issues that are important to the city of Barcelona. 40 participants attended this 3rd Sensory Cities networking workshop in Barcelona. We invited a mixture of museum curators, academics, urban professionals (branding professional and urban planners from Barcelona city council), artists and the third sector to speak and had this time an 'audience' of post-graduate, undergraduate students and the genera public that actively participated in the discussion. 

We started our workshop with a philosophical inquiry into the cultural underpinnings of the hierarchy of sensory experience, the multiplicity of sensory perceptions and the need to replace the notion of 'landscape' for that of a multisensory environment. This set the tone for a range of Barcelona focused papers that explored the limits of the senses in displaying historical information about the urban past, the importance of Barcelona's sensory environment in framing the city as a brand and how the sensory could allow to shape tourism beyond 'the gaze. Throughout the question of whose senses were present and absent, as well as who has the power to frame the senses informed the discussion. This was equally relevant when analysing homelessness in the city as well as the ways in which tourism brings to the fore new ways of sensing the city. The afternoon included a guided walk around CCCB's latest exhibition on Africa and a demonstration of the use of objects and senses in bringing experiences to live for different audience, including people with dementia as we had seen in Cologne. The last session focused on the Carrer Hospital from a variety of perspectives. We started with an insider's view from a political scientist who had been born there and has seen his house and family past be demolished. This was followed by reports on how culture is used in multiple ways in el Raval by a number of actors from migrant charities to urban planners to connect people to place and create place attachments. We concluded the day with an interactive workshop with a presentation on the Barcelona of sounds and the Theatre of the Senses that explored how to put the sensory body at the forefront of research methods. The methodological emphasis of the Barcelona workshop was on the representation of sensory relationships and how to make these tangible for different audiences. On the second day five inter-disciplinary, cross-professional groups (25 participants) were asked to analyse sensory power relations in the Carrer Hospital with a view to the 'audience' they were going to present them to: youth, tourists, policy makers, locals and museum curators. Those attending the workshop reported an increased interest in sensory methods and especially the urban planners and museum curators attending wanted to explore in more detail the relevance of the senses by also taking their ideas back to their work practice and we are in discussions of delivery of sensory training workshops for the museums, architects and planners involved.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58be9759d34f07.47500746</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sensorycities.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newspaper artice: 'Wie riecht und schmeckt der Eigelstein?'
