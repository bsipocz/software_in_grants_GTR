Most X-rays pass straight through these Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) and CMOS detectors and it is therefore necessary to use a thicker detector (e.g. CMOS hybrid) or a scintillator. However, current methods produce detector systems with limited performance: CMOS-hybrid technology requires intricate features limiting the minimum pixel size and spatial resolution, whilst the readout speed of CCD-based systems is limited by higher noise levels.

Over recent years we have completed an STFC funded concept study on a novel photon-counting detector. The Electron-Multiplying (EM) CCD was designed for low light level imaging such as night-time surveillance or night-vision. The EM-CCD differs from the standard CCD through the addition of a &amp;quot;gain register&amp;quot;. By multiplying the signal by thousands, the effective read noise of the device can be reduced to the sub-electron level, allowing operation at very high speeds. If a scintillator is coupled to an EM-CCD then this low effective noise allows analysis of single photon interactions (photon counting), providing higher resolution imaging and energy discrimination.

The small area (8mm x 8mm) scintillator-coupled EM-CCD operated at 2fps, limiting potential applications. Further developments are required to transfer this technology and expertise to the marketplace.

We aim to produce a large area, high speed X-ray detector module, making use of the now commercially available high-speed electronics developed from the STFC funded 'Lucky Imaging' at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. By coupling a fibre-optic taper to a larger area EM-CCD, an increase in area of over 44 times is possible. It is envisaged that a series of modules will then be formed into an array, creating a much larger system. We also aim to test the suitability of the scintillating fibre-optic (SFO). Whilst the SFO has largely been ignored for use with a CCD due to lower light output, it has a highly structured form, minimising the signal spread. With the EM-CCD's ability to apply gain to the signal, it is expected that a high-resolution integrating system may be produced.

In comparison to previous detectors, the expected performance of the new module will give a higher resolution, faster speed (increasing beamline throughput), higher effective dynamic range through higher maximum flux before saturation and higher detection efficiency, higher signal to noise and operation at higher temperatures. The projected specifications of the module will provide these substantial benefits to users, including allowing higher throughput in the beamline facilities and shutter-less performance, providing the high speed of the low resolution 'pixel detectors' and the high resolution of the low speed CCD systems.

Through the production of a proof of concept prototype module, not only will this technology be opened up to the marketplace, but the range of applications for the EM-CCD will be dramatically expanded, opening new markets for this device.

This detector is aimed towards applications at synchrotron facilities such as macromolecular crystallography, surface diffraction or small-angle scattering techniques, high energy X-ray diffraction and phase-contrast imaging. Applications in medical imaging may also be envisaged for a larger array of modules.

The market for this detector is approximately $94M worldwide and we aim to bring the same revolutionary performance enhancements that were experienced in the fields of fluorescent and luminescent markers in life sciences from the introduction of EM-CCD camera systems.

To transfer this technology and expertise to the marketplace, we propose to build a proof of concept module with the support of e2v technologies, a leading designer, developer and manufacturer of high performance imaging sensors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90595</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Swiss Light Source (SLS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>PSI</gtr:description><gtr:id>49E7B26E-5D89-497C-BF9C-55C284BC42EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many publications (see publications).

Although the testing of only one system was initially proposed, as the project progressed it became apparent that there were two possible areas that could greatly benefit from the research and hence two systems were developed and tested for these two main applications. More on this can be found under Key Findings, however, the availability of the information in these publications is intended to be helpful to any party developing systems for other applications.

The mini-IPS project is, as intended, a stepping stone towards a full IPS application during which a product, i.e. the outcomes of the research, can be taken to the market place. To avoid duplicating the original grant proposal, details of the potential market for detectors of this nature are not given here, suffice to say that there would clearly be positive impact to the UK economy were this product to be produced. All parts are manufactured and designed in the UK and would come together to form the camera system.

Our synchrotron detector developments, as a result of this project and a related PhD studentship have taken a large turn towards development of systems for production. We are working with a local company to provide a customised camera system for PSI, with possible similar systems now being given interest by Diamond and synchrotrons in the US and Japan. This development has the potential for approximately &amp;pound;2m worth of systems to be developed by local industry and e2v technologies over the next few years.

Update on the above paragraph (March 2016): A new camera system has been developed and installed at PSI by the local company. A new system has also been installed in the US and further system orders have been placed. This has not only brought in new orders for e2v technologies for specialised detectors, but it has allowed the local company to employ a new full-time member of staff to work specifically on this new line of business. The staff member is also undertaking a part-time PhD studentship at the OU with Hall (original PI) and Soman (a PhD student who worked on the original ideas). This project has demonstrated a great deal of economic benefit in income to the UK and employment, whilst also allowing continued training and personal development of new staff. With the new systems in place, this project will also have furthered other fields in synchrotron research by providing more accurate and higher resolution data for RIXS.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A88E1339-4A33-4E59-AE96-70AB34CBDBD6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453b7717a4ae4.21085349</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Electronics,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research proposal detailed the development of a taper-coupled high-speed, high-resolution imaging system based on new EM-CCD technology. However, during the early stages of the study, a second application came to our attention that would benefit as much as, if not more than, the original proposed application. It was decided that the two applications would be taken forward, leading to the development of two systems (one taper coupled and one lens coupled).

Both systems were tested at the Diamond Light Source and the highly successful results published in refereed journals as well as disseminated at several international conferences.

During the study it was proposed to test a scintillating fibre-optic as a possible &amp;quot;ultimate&amp;quot; scintillator in terms of the potential resolution achievable. However, during the course of the study it was found that the light output of the scintillating fibre-optic sample was too low for the proposed applications. The potential of the two systems was tested for use with a columnar scintillator structure. 

The taper-coupled system was found to perform very well under testing at Diamond, but the benefits over other technologies was limited somewhat by recent advances in pixel-detectors during the course of the project period.

The lens-coupled system (tested as a new development during the study itself), however, was found to greatly outperform our hopes and has the potential to significantly out perform scientific CMOS based systems that are the current class-leader in this area. To bring about this potential it will be necessary to develop the system further, ideally through a full IPS project in the future.

Full details of the system performance can be found in the referenced publications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has been disseminated at several international conferences and also published in two refereed articles. The outcomes of the research are now widely available and as such should benefit the wider scientific community.

With regards to taking the findings forward, this will require a full IPS grant proposal for a 3-year project to take the prototyped system(s) to market. This will be done by the same researcher(s) who carried out the initial mini-IPS study, subject to a grant application being submitted and accepted in the near future. Through this route it is intended to bring the wide-ranging benefits of this new technology to the marketplace, benefiting not only the scientific users but also the UK economy.
