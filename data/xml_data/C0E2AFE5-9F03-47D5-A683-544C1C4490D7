The reports and correspondence clearly indicate a level of tension and suspicion in relationships among the medical and ecclesiastical authorities that has, to date, remained unexplored. They throw new, though controversial, light on the internal governance of local Mexican hospitals and raise questions relating to the means by which individuals progressed in their medical careers during this period and the use of patronage within medico-scientific circles in the eighteenth-century Spanish empire.\n Much is still unknown about foreign practitioners, especially the Irish, who chose to forge a career in the Spanish Americas during this period: the means by which they succeeded or failed to establish social and professional networks; the role they played in the development of medical practices; and tensions frequently evident as they negotiate the realities of the Spanish Americas. It will build particularly upon the seminal study into medical power structures undertaken by John Tate Lanning, and more recent work into medical training, practices and networks, including Miruna Achim's recent study of lizard remedies for venereal disease. In broader terms, the research can also be placed within scholarship on the relationship between Europe and the Spanish Americas, and between Ireland and Europe, especially in terms of the transmission and reception of scientific ideas, and the role of medicine and science within the 'vision' of empire, and Irish involvement in military affairs. \n This study will analyse his reports and assess the veracity of his accusations of malpractice, murder, deceit and corruption, within the colonial hospital system and beyond through a comparative aysis of a range of official army, hospital, and university documents associated to these events and this period. The project aims to interrogate two main documents, exploring the ambiguities of a self-consciously constructed narrative in order to understand: the tensions in the relationship between the foreign and local medical practitioners (including those posted with the military); perception of Mexican and European medical institutions in the exercise of authority (Real Protomedicato and Real Academia Nacional de Medicina); the means by which national networks (in this case the Irish) and use of patronage provided a medium for the transatlantic scientific movement of ideas.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit two main groups research will impact on a local level:\n\n- Academic = Historians of Irish history and History of Medicine in Ireland, historians of Latin American medicine,culture and history in the early modern period. \n\n- Non-academic = local interest groups, such as the Ulster Society for the History of Medicine, and cultural groups with an interest in promoting Irish history and culture, especially questions concerning migration, such as the Ulster Museum and the Omagh Centre for Migration Studies. Also, Belfast has a large association linking individuals from Ireland and Latin America, Latinoam&amp;eacute;rica unida, who are actively involved in the Latin American Studies Forum of which I am Director. \n\nOn an international level the research will benefit:\n\n- academics working in the field of the History of Medicine in Latin America and on a trans-Atlantic level. \n\nThis also includes ongoing international projects such as, The Irish in Europe Project based in Maynooth, Ireland, directed by Prof. Marian Lyons and Dr Thomas O'Connor, that has enabled the creation of a virtual environment charting Irish migration (http://www.irishineurope.com/vre/). Linked to this project through Trinity College Dublin, is another ongoing project currently supported by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient&amp;iacute;ficas: LA COMUNIDAD IRLANDESA EN LA MONARQU&amp;Iacute;A HISP&amp;Aacute;NICA (SIGLOS XVI-XVIII): IDENTIDAD E INTEGRACI&amp;Oacute;N SOCIAL http://www.irishinspain.org/presentacion_p2.html).\n\n- It will benefit the work of international societies such as the Society for Irish latin American Studies, comprising a wide range of individuals from academic and non-academic backgrounds, which focus on the area of migration and the impact of the movement of Irish people from the early modern period.\n \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63471</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Medical humanities PG skills workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3675AE6C-37C3-4A68-8CC2-3C5ED891E5A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I worked with a team of postgraduate students to organise a training day to encourage students to engage with new paths in the medical humanities, linking the training to my research and that of some of the international participants who were also coming to attend the medical humanities colloquium the following day. 

This one-day workshop was organised across the Schools of Modern Languages, English, and History and Anthropology and supported by the Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities and Queen's University Belfast. It was open to MA and Doctoral level research students who are interested in or are currently pursuing research in the medical humanities. It brought together a broad range of specialists across different subject areas and institutions who will provide their own personal insights into the opportunities and resources available to students interested in the Medical Humanities across history and literature and ranging from the 17th - 21st centuries, as well as a focus on the development of a range of skills essential for postgraduate development. 

The day will began with a plenary introduction to the resources of the Wellcome Library and opportunities in libraries and archives in the USA. The afternoon comprised four individual strands - Spanish, French, English, and History, focusing on skills such as: conducting archival research; reading early modern documents; digitisation; ethics; medicine and literature.

After this event I worked with colleagues to establish a new inter-disciplinary staff and postgraduate research group in the medical humanities under the auspices of the Institute for Collaborative Research at Queen's, we have also organised another day of medical humanities training as part of the newly formed MA training programme established in 2014. As a result of the postgraduate interest I also secured funding for a doctoral student working on medicine in colonial Latin America, beginning in October 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546cafeb5dca62.59706684</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofModernLanguages/Research/LatinAmericanStudiesForum/MedicalhumanitiesPGskillsworkshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To date, my findings have been used to publish 1 peer-reviewed journal article and also to set a foundation for a strategic doctoral scholarship that will continue investigation into the role of Irish medical migration in colonial Latin America.

This work has uncovered how these individuals created networks of influence and knowledge across the Atlantic, using Irish commercial networks to promote their interests in Europe whilst they worked and lived in the Spanish Americas. I have also been able to show how the particular individual at the centre of this study played a key role in uncovering little known details relating to unorthodox and illegal medical practices in the hospitals and institutions of colonial Mexico, particularly in the treatment of syphilis. As such, he stands as an example of the importance of investigating the less successful or the overlooked subjects of medical history. This serves to open up a broader discussion about the perception of 'value' in the history of medicine.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is still early in the process to consider this question as the main publication is not yet available. However, this work will lead to a deeper investigation of Irish medical migration in the colonial Latin American context, opening up new avenues to question how we view orthodox and unorthodox, or successful and unsuccessful, medical practices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8A823DEA-E7C5-4304-8D62-3175D8348E9E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546cbc9e9c6ef4.09164557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>812D6981-2054-4400-84AB-1599805E3FFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Appealing to the Republic of Letters: An Autopsy of Anti-venereal Trials in Eighteenth-century Mexico.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social history of medicine : the journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/846e4654dd607ce5c03acfe15e02ef08"><gtr:id>846e4654dd607ce5c03acfe15e02ef08</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clark F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0951-631X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545bb50be45d13.36755769</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025972/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
