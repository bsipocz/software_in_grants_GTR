The software will be developed with a user-friendly interface, potentially allowing clinicians to use the software without specialist training in computational fluid dynamics. A data set of approximately 500 patients will also be collected, in collaboration with Derriford hospital, Plymouth.
Treatment of cardiovascular disease CVD costs the UK healthcare system around &amp;pound;9 billion per year, with a further &amp;pound;19 billion per years estimated in economic costs (from statistics of the British heart foundation). Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the largest subset of cardiovascular disease, and is responsible for approximately 70,000 deaths per year in the UK alone. Heart attacks are responsible for the majority of CHD related deaths; which occurs when areas of the heart are not receiving enough blood due to clotting or vessel narrowing, which may be caused by calcification. 
The current gold standard of determining whether a stenosis is significant is the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is routinely performed during catheterisation (in the western world), requiring a catheter with a pressure sensitive tip to be inserted in the femoral artery, which is then guided to the coronary arteries. A hyperaemic drug is administered, which increases blood flow through the coronary arteries to simulate the effects of exercise. The pressure drop across the vessel narrowing is then recorded. Larger pressure drops indicate more severe stenosis. 
Computational FFR or cFFR is a relatively new concept. At its base, it requires an imaging technique to be performed, such as CT scanning; this allows the extraction of patient specific geometry; from this geometry computer simulation is performed, which uses state-of-the-art mathematical modelling; this allows the preure drop across the narrowing to be determined non-invasively. One of the main advantages of cFFR is that no invasive procedures are required, thus there is no patient discomfort or recovery time; furthermore, it is less expensive per patient.
 Most current software use 3D modelling, often considering vessel walls to be rigid and require experts in CFD to reliably run the simulation. The 3D software also often takes over 6 hours per simulation. Moreover, recently studies have shown that vessel wall motion is of importance, and hence rigid wall assumptions may be detrimental to any model. 
A reduced order 1D-0D model has been developed in Swansea University and early results are promising. The model currently performs with a similar accuracy to the 3D rigid wall models. Moreover, the vessel walls are not considered rigid, and reduced order modelling is much faster than the 3D models. This computational FFR software is currently being tested with retrospective patient data, supplied by Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.
The aim of the proposed project is to further develop and improve the software based on reduced order modelling to calculate FFR. Moreover, the number of patient cases to be collected and tested would be increased to at least 500 data sets. The data would consist of CT scans, from which geometric information can be obtained, and anonymised measurements such as measured pressure. Once the data has been processed, machine learning will be performed on the data, to potentially further improve estimation of the FFR value.
The potential applications and benefits to the proposed project are widespread. The software has the potential to improve patient treatment planning, improve patient experience and outcomes, and significantly decrease the cost per patient. In addition to the clinical applications; the software also has significant commercial potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of the proposed research is to test and improve computational FFR software which can, using non-invasive patient measurements, determine the severity of a coronary artery stenosis. The improvements to the software would include the introduction of more automated, or semi-automated processes. By the end of the project, non-computational fluid dynamic specialists (possibly clinicians) would be able to use the software. Furthermore, machine learning will be performed on a data set of approximately 500 patients. 
The software, which has been developed in Swansea University, involves the segmentation of patient CT scans, after which reduced-order computational fluid dynamics is performed; this can be used to determine the pressure drop (FFR value) caused by the stenosis in the coronary arteries; and will be compared with the clinically measured FFR value for the patient to test the diagnostic accuracy of the software. Anonymised patient data, which includes CT scans and basic patient information (pressures, body mass index), can be collected through an existing agreement with Derriford hospital in Plymouth. Approximately 500 data sets will be collected for the project. Machine learning will be applied to the data set to determine if any underlying patterns can be found, which could lead to improved calculation of a patient's FFR value.
In addition to valuable patient data, the opportunities of such a software could be widespread. The software could improve the patient treatment planning pathway. The methodology used only requires non-invasive patient measurements and imaging techniques. This could potentially reduce the cost of patient diagnosis; it would also improve patient experience, by avoiding invasive catheterisation procedures, and hence would not require patient recovery time. There is also a significant commercial opportunity of such a software.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>284559</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S004076/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
