This inter-disciplinary project aims at mapping and analysing the emergence, character, and development of the UK independent museums sector from 1960-2020. 

Between 1970 and 1989, approximately 1300 new museums opened in the UK. The vast majority of these new venues were independent, were founded by community and special interest groups, and individual collectors, and they differed from public-sector museums to such an extent that that they were judged to have 'revolutionized' the sector. There are now some 1600 independent museums in the UK, but despite the extraordinary boom in their numbers we know very little about them. Regional and national funding bodies and museums associations collect data on independent museums, but it is not cross referenced and is limited to their specific remits and areas of interest. They do not keep records on when museums opened and if they close, small museums often fall from view entirely, and the information that is available cannot be mapped or easily searched.

In the first phase of the research we will collate and supplement existing information to establish a dataset of all UK museums from 1960-2020 and, in turn, build a database that is searchable according to factors including location, date of foundation, subject matter, size, type of museums, and combinations of these attributes. This information will be mapped visually and will be freely available in open source format on a project website to be hosted by the Bishopsgate Institute. In the second phase of the research we will use the database to identify patterns in the emergence, development and closure of independent museums and then seek to account for those trends (or anomalies) through the use of further visualisations, a focus group with Arts Council England staff, historical research, and an extensive series of interviews with staff in museums. 

This research will provide the first authoritative database of independent museums in the UK, and the first history of their recent development. It is important for academics in museum studies, arts management, cultural studies, and cultural and social history in that it will:
1. Provide a nuanced historical overview of the independent museum sector. 
2. Provide a detailed analysis of a period of massive expansion and change within the museum sector.
3. Identify subjects that were or are of local or national concern.
4. Bring orthodox histories of the UK museum boom into question. 
5. Demonstrate the scale and variety of the small independent museum sector, and hence of non-professional cultural production.
6. Generate resources for future researchers.

The research will also have benefits for arts funders and policy-makers, and for staff in independent and public-sector museums in that it will:
1. Inform our understanding of the factors that underpin the emergence and closure of independent museums.
2.Track correlations between independent museums' emergence and specific funding streams.
3. Reveal regional differences across the museum sector. 
4. Provide a solid knowledge base about their sector and thereby improve capacity for evidence-based advocacy and decision-making.

We also anticipate the research being of interest to a general public in that it will:
1. Produce an oral history archive that can be used by amateur historians.
2. Raise awareness of volunteer-run organisations.
3. Offer volunteer-run museums an overview of their sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic recession and recent cuts to funding have presented serious challenges to museums and galleries in the UK. In 2014 more than half the museums surveyed by the Museums Association reported that their income had fallen and that they had cut staff. In this context, it is vital to have a long view of the history and sustainability of museums. The overview provided by this research would inform museum professionals and funders about changes over a sixty year period in the independent museum sector and their historical correlation to location, employment, transport networks, land-prices, tourism, different types of funding, and the presence of public-sector museums.

The project has already garnered commitments and strong interest from arts policy-makers, funders, professional associations, and archives. Arts Council England (ACE) and the Association of Independent Museums (AIM) have and will contribute data to the project. ACE have invited the project team to attend meetings of the Museum Development Network which involves museums development managers from England and Wales. They will both input into the research process and be a conduit for disseminating research findings. AIM is actively assisting in the dissemination of research findings via its magazine, conference, and online publications. Both AIM and ACE will assist in recruiting participants for the project's evaluation event. The Bishopsgate Institute will be archiving our interview-based material, hosting an archive launch event as part of their annual programme, and hosting the website.

More specifically, the beneficiaries will be:
1. Policy makers and funders. Some, but by no means all, independent museums are eligible for arts funding. Historically, they have also received funding from other sources e.g. EU Objective One. In providing an evidence-based analysis of patterns of opening and closure of museums and of links to arts and other funding streams, this research would enhance the effectiveness of policy makers and funders including ACE, CyMAL: Museums Libraries Archives Wales, Northern Ireland Museums Council, and Museums Galleries Scotland. 

2. The Association of Independent Museums. AIM is a national charitable organisation that supports and advocates on behalf of independent museums and galleries. This research would provide a detailed evidence-based historical overview of their sector, and improve their ability to advocate on behalf of independent museums, thereby improving the health of that sector. 

3. Independent museums would benefit from the research on several counts. Developing the knowledge base of AIM would help the independent museums that the organisation represents. The project website and publication will directly provide staff at independent venues with a solid knowledge base about their sector, which has the potential to improve their decision making capacities. In addition, the research will enhance public awareness of independent museums across the UK. This will potentially impact upon visitor numbers, particularly of the smaller venues that do not feature on websites such as Culture 24, thereby improving their sustainability. 

4. Bishopsgate Institute. The project will add to their holdings by greatly developing the Micromuseums Archive, and it will contribute to their annual events programme. 

5. General public. By drastically improving the knowledge base of arts funders, policy-makers, and local authorities, this research has the potential to improve the services that they offer, and therefore the quality of visitors' experience. More specifically, independent museums rely heavily on volunteer labour; some are run entirely by volunteers. This project will raise awareness of volunteer run museums and offer volunteers an overview of that sector. The project will also make research materials available to amateur historians, thereby increasing their opportunities for cultural engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>809968</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N007042/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
