Globally, sex workers face violence from clients, boyfriends, pimps and police. This abuse is not only physical but also psychological and ?symbolic? - including more subtle harms such as discrimination and social stigma. We need to understand how these different forms of violence affect sex workers? ability to protect themselves against other risks, including HIV, drug use, stress and depression, to improve the health and wellbeing of this marginalised population.
Peru is an excellent case study to research these issues. A recent survey shows that violence against sex workers is very common in this setting, and many sex workers are not aware of their rights. This study will use a mix of research methods, analysing existing survey data and carrying out interviews with sex workers, policy-makers and service providers, to investigate how discrimination affects sex workers? vulnerability to violence, and their capacity to protect their physical and mental health. This study will provide crucial evidence for public health interventions which aim to reduce violence and improve the health of sex workers globally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Sex workers face multiple physical and mental health risks, including violence, HIV, coercion, drug use, stress and depression. Despite widespread abuse, sex workers have received little attention in global reviews of violence. Violence can have severe physical and emotional health consequences and increases vulnerability to HIV. Stigma may further exacerbate vulnerability to physical and psychological violence, and affect emotional health and capacity to manage risk.
The World Health Organization advocates violence reduction interventions among sex workers. Structural approaches - which address social, environmental and political factors - are considered crucial for HIV prevention. The concept of ?structural violence? provides a framework to study the consequences of different forms of violence, physical, emotional and ?symbolic? (such as stigma). Peru has among the highest rates of domestic violence globally and a high prevalence of abuse against female sex workers, providing an excellent case study to investigate how structural factors bring about and sustain physical, emotional and symbolic violence, and affect capacity to manage risk - an under-researched area.
Aim: To investigate how structural factors affect vulnerability to violence and mediate capacity for risk reduction among male, female and transgender sex workers in Peru.
Objectives:
(1) To examine associations between structural factors, physical, emotional and symbolic violence among sex workers
(2) To explore pathways through which structural, physical, emotional and symbolic violence mediate capacity to manage emotional health and other risks among sex workers
(3) To analyse how key agencies mediate structural factors which affect the risk of violence among sex workers
Methods: A mixed methods study, set in Peru, comprising: 
A) A systematic literature review of the risk of violence among sex workers globally, followed by a secondary analysis of data from the ?Sex Worker Empowermenin Peru, examining associations between structural factors, violence and other health outcomes; B) a qualitative study of structural factors affecting risk of violence, how different forms of violence interact, and how these affect capacity to manage health risks, using in-depth interviews with sex workers; and C) a stakeholder analysis to explore key agencies? perspectives on structural determinants of violence among sex workers, and their potential role in mediating these factors, using semi-structured interviews. 
Outputs: Findings will inform structural interventions to reduce violence and other health risks among sex workers globally, as well as feeding directly into national policy in Peru. This study will also identify scope for further research addressing the structural context of risk.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>180776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cayetano Heredia University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Peru, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Studies in Health, Sexuality and Human Development (IESSDEH)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia</gtr:description><gtr:id>F14138C7-0B27-41C6-8931-55B61C26D349</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of this collaboration, I was invited to co-author a chapter on Male Sex Work in Peru, together with Professor Carlos Caceres, to form part of a international English-language text on international male sex work.

This is a multi-disciplinary collaboration.

My advisors at USSDH advised on locally-relevant literature and aspects of study design, implementation and analysis, in conjunction with my supervisory and advisory group at my home institution, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). I met regularly with my local advisors at USSDH to discuss fieldwork progress. The team introduced me to local fieldworkers and sex worker/LGBT rights organizations and provided facilities for fieldworker training. They also facilitated recruitment and organization of stakeholder interviews. Together with the fieldworker team and my local advisors, the broader USSDH research team provided valuable feedback on a presentation of my emerging research findings. My local advisors have continued to provide me with academic advice as I prepare my PhD thesis and resulting manuscripts for publication. We are also collaborating on disseminating the key findings to local practitioners, policy makers, community stakeholders (including sex workers), research participants and other researchers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>During the data collection phase of this fellowship (year 2), I was hosted by the Unidad de Salud, Sexualidad y Desarollo Humano (USSDH) at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru.
I designed the study (qualitative interview study and stakeholder analysis), developed the data collection tools, recruited and trained a team of local fieldworkers, conducted and supervised data collection, and led data analysis. In the later phase of data collection, I presented preliminary findings to the research group at USSDH as well as the fieldworker team, which provided me with valuable feedback that I have fed into analyses. Throughout my placement at USSDH, I held regular skype meetings with my supervisor and advisors at my home institution, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Since returning to LSHTM, I have remained in regular contact with my advisors and fieldwork team in Lima, as I prepare my PhD thesis and resulting manuscripts for publication.

I presented on the health harms of sex work criminalisation, drawing on a qualitative systematic review that I undertook as part of my MRC fellowship. The symposium was attended by MPs, governmental and third sector health and social care practitioners working with sex workers, sex workers (organisations, and independently) and other researchers, from across the UK and a number of other countries. The event has been widely discussed and cited via social and broadcast media, as well as by leading UK politicians. I was subsequently invited to give evidence to the Liberal Democrat Working Group on Consenting Commercial Sex and to contribute to an academic response to the Home Affairs Select Committee Prostitution Inquiry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda3648f6350.58270923</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://prostitutescollective.net/2015/10/29/decriminalisation-of-prostitution-the-evidence/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>482441</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NIHR Public Health Research Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Institute for Health Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>PHR Project: 15/55/58</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E1CC0B96-1D99-4DE9-BA42-8E674C837F28</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b251150115.62193893</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>54719</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Open Society Public Health Program</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Open Society Foundation, New York</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>OR2015-24978</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C521279D-BEDC-4E64-A250-B95B1CBC2050</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b1f0ee458b07.54829900</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited to give evidence to the Liberal Democrat Working Group on Consenting Commercial Sex Work</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF7BB2A6-C494-406B-AD1F-EB3F78771276</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9ea7ac51f5.73367322</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B06FF8F1-D23A-4EC1-ADFF-B7955469619B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Men Who Sell Sex: Global Perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/603cef25e6a8b02bb278f4a2590bab5e"><gtr:id>603cef25e6a8b02bb278f4a2590bab5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>C?ceres CF; Bayer AM; Gomero A; Grenfell P; Salazar X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-72351-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545919f04ded63.25396108</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CCC3D37-3067-4C50-8FE4-FD8B2651984B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Decriminalising sex work in the UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ (Clinical research ed.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d8cf65f9fdc3a485d2823ba72515563"><gtr:id>2d8cf65f9fdc3a485d2823ba72515563</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grenfell P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-535X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b10655e213.02702276</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1002370</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>986F1CAE-CC43-4D59-8F85-A91971E4C4BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Other</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
