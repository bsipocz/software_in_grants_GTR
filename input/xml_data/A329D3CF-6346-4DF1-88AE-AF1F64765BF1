Up to 80% of patients with breast cancer have tumour cells that contain a protein, known as the estrogen receptor alpha (ER). ER mediates the effects of the hormone, estrogen and is instrumental to the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells. When cancer affects the breast alone, it is often readily treatable. Unfortunately, when breast cancer cells spread (metastasise) to other parts of the body, the disease becomes incurable. It is believed that higher levels of ER in certain breast cancers may contribute to the risk of spread and the cancer consequently becoming incurable.

Currently, most tumours that contain ER are treated with hormone treatments that reduce the levels of estrogen in the body and thereby block the actions of ER. This is often initially successful at controlling the cancer but in the case of cancer that has spread, eventually the drug stops being effective; resistance develops. At present, there are very few other treatment options available for patients when this happens - usually a different type of hormone treatment is used. This may also be effective initially but with each new anti-hormone drug used, the duration of efficacy becomes shorter and shorter. 

Many mechanisms for the development of resistance to these hormone treatments have been proposed. In the last 18 months, important new studies have discovered that in about 40% of patients who have breast cancer that has spread and become resistant to hormone treatment, mutations in the ER gene are present and it is believed that these mutations overcome the need of ER to be activated by estrogen and thus these cancers grow despite the estrogen reducing therapies. 

There is an urgent need to determine the mechanisms of action of these mutant ER proteins in the laboratory, so as to identify treatment options for patients with ER mutations. To do this, the laboratory has created metastatic breast cancer cells that have been genetically modified to gain the ER mutations. These cells recapitulate resistance to hormone treatments and so represent a very useful means of determining how the mutant proteins work and for rapid evaluation of new treatments to overcome hormone treatment resistance. 

In the presence of estrogen, ER can also bind with specific proteins (transcription factors) that regulate the expression of other genes. Some of these other genes regulate proteins that are responsible for the detection of hormones, bile acids and other substances (nuclear receptors) whilst others are essential to many cellular functions including metabolism and signalling (kinases). We have found that levels of some of these proteins are increased in the breast cancer cells with ER mutations. We propose that drugs that target one or more of these proteins could provide the means to treat breast cancer with ER mutations.

We aim to carry out studies with the cell lines making the mutant ER proteins, to determine if any of the over-represented proteins are important for growth of these cancer cells and to test if blocking their action with specific drugs can be used to kill cells with ER mutations. Drugs that target many of these up-regulated proteins are already available and used in other clinical settings so may easily be repurposed if found to be effective. If our findings suggest that these drugs are efficacious in breast cancer cells, we would develop a clinical trial in the future to confirm these findings in patients with breast cancer. 

The work will be conducted by Dr Kirsty Balachandran, a specialist registrar in medical oncology who is dedicated to improving the care patients with breast cancer receive by investigating potential new treatment strategies in the laboratory and developing these to expand therapies available in clinical practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims:
ESR1 mutations, as demonstrated in MCF7-Y537S cells, are associated with estrogen independent function and resistance to anti-estrogens. Gene expression profiling demonstrates that many ER target genes are upregulated in MCF7-Y537S cells. We aim to establish whether these key genes associated with ER function have utility as therapeutic targets in metastatic, ESR1 mutant breast cancer.

Objectives:
1. Confirm the upregulation of identified nuclear receptors and EGF family members in MCF7-Y537S cells.
2. Investigate whether nuclear receptors and kinase cascades overexpressed in MCF7-Y537S cells are also upregulated in CRISPR-Cas9 engineered metastatic breast cancer cell lines expressing other ESR1 mutations.
3. Determine mechanisms of action of these overexpressed nuclear receptors and kinase cascades in breast cancer cell lines. 
4. Investigate whether modulation of the identified nuclear receptor and signaling cascades using synthetic agonists/antagonists provide treatment strategies for this setting.

Methodology:
A range of techniques will be utilised including RT-qPCR, Western blotting, growth assays, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, which are performed frequently by the host laboratory. 

Scientific and Medical Opportunities:
The host laboratory have published extensively on ESR1 mutations and possible means of overcoming resistance. Recently published work includes the generation of breast cancer cell line models for ESR1 mutant metastatic disease, including MCF7-Y537S cells, using CRISPR-Cas9, providing a valuable model for assessing the mechanism of action of ESR1 mutations. We will now extend this work to investigate the function of upregulated ER target genes and evaluate potential therapies in mutant ESR1 cell lines. As clinically evaluated modulating drugs for many of these nuclear receptors and signaling pathways already exist, they could readily be repurposed. We propose that these upregulated genes may be useful therapeutic targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the proposed work is to develop novel treatments to circumvent the issue of endocrine resistance in patients with metastatic estrogen receptor alpha (ER) positive breast cancer. The host laboratory has already published extensively on mechanisms of resistance and potential means of overcoming this. The proposed project will extend this study in a logical manner. 

Most recently, the host group has published data about the generation of metastatic breast cancer cell line models for ESR1 mutant breast cancer, using CRISPR-Cas9, a genome editing system used to induce knockin and knockout mutagenesis. Cell lines for the six most common ESR1 mutations have been created, accounting for over 90% of all identified mutations and creating a replicable model for ESR1 mutations. MCF7 cells carrying the Y537S mutation have demonstrated estrogen-independent activity and exhibit resistance to anti-estrogens. It has also been demonstrated that some ER target genes, including certain nuclear receptors and EGF family members, are ligand-independent and over-expressed in MCF7-Y537S cells, both in the presence and absence of estrogen. This proposal intends to confirm this finding, investigate the function of these over-expressed ER target genes in ESR1 mutant and wild-type cell lines and, through the modulation of these target genes, identify new treatment options for metastatic breast cancer with and potentially without ESR1 mutations. 

The beneficiaries of the proposed work will be:
1. Patients
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the therapies available for patients with metastatic ER positive breast cancer and thereby improve their outcomes. If modulation of the over-expressed ER target genes is found to be effective in this setting, there is the potential for several new classes of drugs to become available for these patients. As most of these modulating drugs have already been clinically evaluated and used for other indications, once these findings have been confirmed in vitro, the drugs may quickly be repurposed. We aim for corresponding clinical trials to be established soon after completion of the proposed 3-year laboratory project. In this way, the benefit to patients may be realised in the relative near future. 

2. The scientific community
Elucidation of the function of these over-expressed ER target genes, initially nuclear receptors and EGF family members, will greatly enhance understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to anti-estrogens. This may be applicable, not only to anti-estrogens and breast cancer but other malignancies with parallel modes of resistance, for example anti-androgens and prostate cancer. In this way, this knowledge will not only benefit groups investigating endocrine resistance in breast cancer but potentially a far wider-reaching audience. Results from this work will be presented and published throughout and beyond the study period. 

3. The clinician community 
The proposed work should provide a greater understanding of why patients stop responding to anti-estrogens such as aromatase inhibitors and provide therapeutic options for this eventuality. The investigation of any overlap between the ER target genes and the identified nuclear receptor and kinase target genes may define key common target signaling pathways that may be used as biomarkers for therapies that target these genes. This may revolutionise the way oncologists are able to monitor patients with metastatic breast cancer. The applicant will be trained in the necessary laboratory techniques, data analysis and experimental design by the host group; these skills will be transferable and valuable on return to clinical training. 

The potential impact of this proposal is far-reaching and has significant implications for patient management and outcomes. Though the findings may take a number of years to be translated into clinical practice, the benefits may be considerable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P018521/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
