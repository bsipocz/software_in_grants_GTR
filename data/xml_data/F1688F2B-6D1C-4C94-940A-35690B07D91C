It was groundbreaking at the time, and has remained important and relevant, contributing to our understanding of how maternity care and birth influence women's experiences of motherhood&lt;br />&lt;br />The aim of the current project is to follow-up participants from the original study, approximately 35 years after the birth of their first child. We will explore their reflections on what makes for a smooth transition to motherhood with positive long-term effects. This can be important on both a societal and personal level, taking into account: the long-term costs to society and mothers of depression and low emotional wellbeing; the desirability of avoiding dysfunctional families; and mothers' capacities to be part of the paid work force. We will also ask the women to reflect on the social and health care practices that contributed to their transitions to motherhood, and their subsequent experiences of such practices within the context of their own changing personal social situations. Uniquely, it will allow us to relate these narratives to those they provided at the time they became mothers. &lt;br />&lt;br />We propose to find the original 55 participants through the Medical Research Information Service and via the internet, searching google and the electoral roll. Those located will be invited to participate in one further in-depth qualitative interview. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit academic researchers, policy makers, maternity care practitioners, consumer groups and consumers. This benefit has the potential to be international in scope.

Policy makers
This work will provide policy makers with a more nuanced understanding of women's perceptions of the medium and long-term impacts of policies that provide short-term support (targeted or universal) vs. lack of support re: birth trauma, maternal health, benefits, returning to work, gender equality, social support. It will also help policy makers to have detail about which policies (or aspects of policies) were seen to be beneficial over time regarding women's life course (economic status, employment patterns, health, personal fulfilment, family relationships/patterns through 2 generations, social engagement, etc.)

Practitioners
This work will provide practitioners with detailed insight into the long-term perceived impact of a variety of aspects of the pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care experiences. For instance:of long-term impact of: Type of care in hospital and community maternity services; communication information provision; Degree of control/lack of controlI This greater understanding can be used to improve on-going practice and the training of new practitioners.

Researchers
As described in the academic beneficiaries section, this research will provide additional insight on sociological themes and methodological practice. It will provide greater understanding on: How women view their ideologies have affected their life course; the degree of match between women's recall about their childbirth experience and transition to motherhood after 35 years compared to data at the time;
How we make sense of important life transitions over time;Methodology - i.e. 1. the searching for the women (both how we did it and their responses to being found) and 2. the relationship between the 3 studies (Original, re-study, and this long term follow up study).

Consumers 
For consumers and user organizations, this long term research into the experiences around becoming a mother will provide information about what aspects of the childbirth experience might be key to long term positive transition. This information could be used to lobby for change or provide support for existing medical practices and policy initiatives. This study will also provide users with insight into how participation in research at times of key life transition is viewed with distance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78691</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J006343/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
