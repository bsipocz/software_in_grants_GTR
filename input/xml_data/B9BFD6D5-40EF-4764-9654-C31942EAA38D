Knockout studies have shown that each of the family members (IRF1-9) have distinct functions in regulating important processes such as, development, immune cell function and differentiation, apoptosis, cancer and cell cycle. How this diversity in function for the different family members is achieved is still not fully understood and is a significant area of research currently studied by leading laboratories. One way of achieving this diversity is via protein amino acid modification and differential protein-protein interactions. We are interested in understanding 1) how Interferon regulatory factor 1 activity and function are regulated by posttranslational modifications and 2) how modifications may affect its interaction with other proteins. We have preliminary results which strongly suggest that a specific motif in the IRF1 amino acid sequence is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation event may regulate interactions with co-factors important for IRF1 activity. This motif in IRF1 found in the activation domain consists of six amino acids. There are two amino acids, serine and threonine within this motif which can be modified by enzymatic attachment of a phosphate group. These types of modifications usually change the overall charge distribution of the protein (as phosphate groups are negatively charged). In turn, the added negative charge on the protein can change the folding of a protein due to intramolecular repulsions or attractions. It may also affect interactions with other proteins that affect the activity of the modified protein. Our plan of study is to define the kinase (s) responsible for the phosphorylation of IRF1 at this motif. We have evidence that the kinase involved is GSK-3. This is an extremely important kinase in cellular systems and regulates cell proliferation, insulin signalling, immune responses and neuronal processes. There is much interest currently in understanding GSK-3 activity due to its control of these pathways and it is now a current drug target for treatment of diabetes, depression, inflammation and cancer. We strongly believe our study will impact on all these areas and provide valuable information on how GSK-3 is involved in inflammation and cancer, as IRF1 is intricately involved in controlling these processes in the mammalian system. We know that this amino acid motif in IRF1 is an interaction domain and allows interactions of proteins with co-factors. Thus, we think that phosphorylation of the domain is affecting IRF1's interaction with specific co-factors. We would like to identify these co-factors and determine how they affect IRF1 transcriptional activity. We postulate that these interactions are important for IRF1 function and will affect how IRF1 regulates specific genes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The individual members of the interferon regulatory factor family are known to regulate different processes in the mammalian system despite binding to the same DNA sequence. The activity of certain family members can be changed upon posttranslational modification such as acetylation. We would like to understand if modification of IRF1 can regulate its protein-protein interactions and target gene activity. We have recently identified a domain in IRF1 important for its transcriptional activity and we postulate that phosphorylation of two amino acids (serine and threonine) in this domain regulates the ability of IRF1 to interact with co-factors important for function. To define this mechanism, we will carry out site-directed mutagenesis to map specific amino acids important for the function of this domain. We plan to use mass spectrometry to identify proteins interacting with IRF1 through this domain and then determine if phosphorylation can regulate interactions of these factors with IRF1. We will also identify the kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of IRF1 using small molecule inhibitors and in in-vitro kinase assays. The importance of the identified kinase will be tested by siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown in living cells and determining the affect on IRF1 phosphorylation and activity. Finally, we will carry out transcriptomic analysis to test the affect of these interactions/modifications on specific gene programmes regulated by IRF1.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>275274</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Identification of IRF-1 interacting proteins</gtr:description><gtr:id>094DE5E5-8F28-4E9B-8DC3-6383C8B8B2B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as of yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9620d9ab9620dae-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Identification of interacting partners, many of these are potentially novel interactions that are involved in immune processes or cancer.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Mass Spectrometry of gel slices from IRF1-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out in collaboration with the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics at the University of Cambridge.
