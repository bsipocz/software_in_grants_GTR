Instead, it is proposed that perpetrators are 'engaged followers' who identify with the cause and the authority figure who instructs them to inflict harm. These ideas will be investigated:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>through virtual reality simulations of Milgram's famous obedience studies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>through online studies employing a modified Milgram paradigm&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a field study will be designed to investigate these ideas in a more realistic setting. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The final part of the work will be to organise a set of seminars bringing together historians and psychologists to discuss the nature and role of obedience in real-life atrocities. In this way, the aim of the project is to affect both academic and popular understandings of obedience and atrocity.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is aimed to have impact at two levels. First, we aim to affect media and popular understanding of the nature of obedience and the human capacity for atrocity. This is the more immediate and direct form of impact. Second, we aim to affect the understandings and the practice of institutions for whom issues of mistreatment and abuse are potentially highly relevant - the police and the armed services in particular. The impact here is, for the moment, more long-term and indirect.
Popular understanding: Our impact on popular understanding will be achieved both directly though some of the specially designed outputs from our work (the film and the popular book) and also through contacts with the media.
We have a long record of working with mainstream media. For instance, our BBC Prison study was (as the name suggests!) conducted with the BBC and televised as four hour long documentaries. We have regularly contributed to a series of BBC television and radio programmes (e.g. The Today Programme, PM, All in the Mind, Thinking Allowed and Lent Broadcasts on Radio 4, Bang goes the theory on BBC1), we have written a number of pieces for the BBC website and also for a wide variety of print media, notably the Guardian Science Blog on a number of occasions. Specifically, our work on Milgram has featured both on the BBC website and the Guardian website. We have also worked closely with the Science Media Centre on a number of projects.
Through this work, we have developed excellent contacts which we aim to draw on in order to get media involvement in the seminar series. Alongside these seminars (or possibly as part of them), we will seek to set up a debate on 'conformity and atrocity' which will be co-sponsored by a media organisation and hence disseminated by them. In naddition to this, we are regularly contacted by the media on issues relating to obedience and we will continue to disseminate our ideas in this way.
Institutional practice: Over many years, we have worked with the police in order to feed our analyses of crowd behaviour into public order policies and practices. More recently we have worked with the armed services in contributing to the ethics component of their advanced command courses. The aim here is to provide an understanding of the factors which make abuse of host populations and of captives possible and thereby to guard against such abuse. Our research will feed directly to the lectures we give to the armed services. However, with stronger and more convincing evidence (especially in due course when the field study is completed) we hope to use our work to affect the training that personnel are given and also the operational procedures that are used in actual conflict situations (e.g. in Iraq and in Afganistan). While we do not envisage that we will be able to achieve such impact in the short term and directly out of the work done on this project, our hope is that the relationships created in this project and the future work to which it gives rise will enable us to have such impact in due course.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196366</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a new film about Obedience</gtr:description><gtr:id>23DE9CE3-12F9-4DDB-BD12-4ADF63FC3D3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film won best Australian documentary award at the 2015 Antenna Film Festival</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e017d67a68c5.44521263</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Shock Room</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://shockroomfilm.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Macquarie University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Making a film about Obedience</gtr:description><gtr:id>545A4511-8C3A-4A11-AED0-7BCE13518AA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film was shown in the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and was the basis for a panel discussion about obedience and atrcoity.

Nonetheless, even with these provisos, we have already had impact in a number of different areas, as outlined below.
First, we have used our findings to develop sessions for the Advanced Command Course and for military promotion courses at the UK Defence Academy, Shrivenham. These sessions challenge conventional explanations of how abuse and atrocity occurs and instead alert people to the psychological steps that lead towards such toxic outcomes. In this way we provide 'early warning' signs to prevent the occurrence of abusive events.
Second, this work has been presented to policy advisors and researchers for the Scottish Government. We are currently in discussion with the head of the research division concerning a joint series of seminars addressing the relevance of social psychological research (including this research on obedience) to policy makers and practitioners.
Third, we have had extended discussions with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, especially with their educational outreach department. The message from our research fits clearly with their remit and also with recent exhibitions in the Museum (e.g. 'Some were Neighbours' - see http://somewereneighbors.ushmm.org/) which aim to encourage people to reflect on their own capacity to act abusively. Accordingly, we have agreed to collaborate on an online resource which outlines our findings, possibly by linking our own website with the Museum website (which received 18.5 million visits in 2014), but also by using Museum materials within our own online resource. This will be contingent on obtaining funds to develop the 'Milgram stream' of our website.
Fourth, we have given a wide range of public talks on our work. In particular, we have spoken to conferences of teachers and of A-level students. We have also written accounts of our work for the A-level Psychology magazine, Psychology Review. In the same way that our previous work revisiting the classic Stanford Prison Experiment has altered the basic school psychology curriculum, so our work is beginning to influence received understandings of Milgram and of obedience.
Fifth, as described under key findings, we worked with filmmaker Kathryn Millard to produce a new film about Obedience ('Shock Room'). This film, in which we provide commentary, lays out our 'engaged follower' model and raises the question 'what would you do' if an authority asked you to do harm. The film was released at the Sydney Antenna Film Festival in October, where it won the award for 'best Australian documentary'. It has had two previews, one in Warsaw to some 300 people and one in London where some 700 people sought to attend a hall that only seated some 250. The previews were followed by panel discussions involving ourselves, historians and others to discuss the nature of Obedience. Now the film is released we plan showings and discussions in North America, Australia, the UK and Europe in the course of 2016. These will give very wide exposure to our findings and ideas.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0EFDABB-7922-4F26-AA75-CE65962EAE20</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e00ac55d35d7.70698323</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Milgram's obedience studies are amongst the most impactful ever conducted in psychology. They are used to argue that ordinary people are capable of inflicting great harm because of a general human disposition to obey orders without paying attention to the consequences. But the studies were profoundly unethical. Hence there is a major challenge in conducting well controlled and ethical research is also sufficiently powerful to reopen debate concerning our understanding of obedience.
Our first achievement, then, was to develop new ethical ways of interrogating obedience. These included (a) studies of Milgram's archive which reveal new details both of how people behaved in the studies and why they behaved as they did; (b) three online paradigms in which people are asked to inflict an escalating series of negative outcomes on others; (c) a virtual reality 'Milgram paradigm' in which behaviour can be shown to mirror that in the originals, albeit with less stress for participants; (d) an innovative film technique dubbed 'immersive digital realism' using trained actors and directors in which, like VR, behaviour mirrors that of Milgram's original participants.
Our second achievement was to use these various paradigms in order to offer a new 'engaged follower' model of obedience. We show that people are well aware of the demands and concerns of both the authority (telling them to inflict harm) and the victim (demanding that they stop) and that the ones they heed are a function of relative identification. Thus, the more people identify with the authority (and the project the authority is pursuing - in Milgram's case, the project of advancing scientific knowledge) the more they obey the experimenter. Conversely, the more they identify with the victim they are harming, the less they will obey. In short, toxic obedience occurs not because people are unaware that they are doing wrong, but because they think they are doing right.
Our third achievement is to use these findings to start a public debate about the nature of toxic obedience. This has included meetings with other academics (notably historians, holocaust scholars, and specialists in war studies). The most significant of these was a two day seminar held in Warsaw in conjunction with the Museum for the History of Polish Jews and Warsaw University. It has included talks to specialist audiences (notably lectures to military personnel about how atrocities occur) and the general public (through popular science articles and multiple media slots both in the UK and internationally).
Our fourth achievement has been to develop popular platforms for disseminating these debates far wider. The Australian film maker Kathryn Millard worked with us to produce a new Milgram documentary. This was pre-previewed in Warsaw and London (followed by a panel discussions). The film has since won a best documentary award and will be widely released in 2016. We have also started to incorporate our Milgram findings on our website www.bbcprisonstudy.org which currently receives in the region of 200,000 hits per day. To achieve the full benefit of this, we have plans to extend the website further</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The issue of obedience is of relevance to any organisation or institution. Our work shows how, contrary to popular understanding, orders are an ineffective way of motivating and directing the behaviour of members. Rather, the key to effective performance is the construction of identification. In this sense, it applies to all the sectors that are listed and others besides. 
Additionally, our work has specific relevance to issues of toxic obedience. Thus far we have concentrated on toxic obedience in military and security contexts. But our work would be equally relevant to recent cases of abuse in the health sector (abuse of patients), the financial sector (mis-selling of financial instruments), the commercial sector (distorting car emissions data) and in government (misuse of evidence to support policy). These are all areas which we aim to address in future work.
Finally, our work points to new ways of bringing together science and the creative industries. That is, we used film not only to record and disseminate scientific knowledge, but we also used film techniques ('immersive digital realism' as described in a previous section) as an innovative method of scientific research.
