PaC presents the poorest prognosis of all major solid tumours with a five-year survival rate of just 5%. The poor survival rate is largely associated with late-stage diagnosis when surgical resection, the only current hope for cure, becomes infeasible. Therefore, earlier prediction of PaC onset, progression and response to treatment may help to improve treatment strategy and patient outcomes.

In recent years, molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) approach has contributed to the better understanding of several cancers and promises to revolutionise clinical practice through precision detection, prevention and treatment of cancers. By connecting putative etiological factors (commonly referred to as exposures or risk factors including treatments) to specific molecular signatures across tumour phenotypes, the MPE approach can yield more accurate measures regarding PaC diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment.

Various studies have implied a number of potential risk factors for PaC, such as age, diabetes, smoking, alcohol and being overweight. The project aims to refine and analyse the utility of the known risk factors for PaC compared to other confounding commoner diagnosis. Then the project will focus at a deeper characterisation of PaC through integration of genetic data with information on environmental risk factors and clinical prognostic factors. Such understanding of how endogenous and exogenous risk factors are connected to molecular changes and how they contribute to the onset and progression of PaC is a critical step in informing evidence-based clinical practice. Further, the work has important practical implications, as this will provide a gene-environment interaction map in various pancreatic diseases to guide efforts for early diagnosis on PaC. The work can also provide evidence linking risk factors, treatment and disease outcomes, thereby supporting the precision medicine initiative. Similarly, identifying any connection between genetic make-up, medication and disease outcome will aid effort in potential drug repurposing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Objective 1:
A population-based comparative cohort study will be conducted between Pancreatic cancer (PaC) diagnosed and other patients matched by the appropriate demographics focusing on various epidemiological factors and clinical data such as demography, lifestyle, physiological , symptoms, diagnoses, medication, blood and urine tests and healthcare utilisation markers. Patients will be classified using data-driven phenotyping algorithm using their so-far-complete healthcare trajectory. Patients' linked electronic health records (EHR) including primary and secondary care data as well as socio-economic and mortality data will be utilised collected from diverse sources such as Barts Health Data Warehouse, NHS Discovery Project East London, CPRD and NCRAS. The PaC events (incidence, recurrence, death) and comparison of these to rates in matched controls will be estimated using appropriate statistical models. Association between various exposures and outcomes will be measured in terms of odds ratios, with length and dose of exposure to known risk factors as stratification categories.

Objective 2:
The -omics data available through cancer-specific initiatives (TCGA, GENIE) as well as molecular data repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress) will be analysed in combination with relevant literature mining to collate existing genomic characterisations of PaC in terms of gene/mutational signatures. The assessment of molecular characteristics of PaC associated to clinical history will be conducted on data derived from PCRF Tissue Bank. Consensus clustering algorithm will be applied to obtain new stratifications of PaC along the themes of disease onset, progression, survival and response to treatment. The association between the expression/mutational status of specific PaC genes and risk/prognostic factors, longitudinal data and response to treatment will be tested. All the data obtained through the project will be published in a mine-able web-based bioinformatics infrastructure.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290233</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003835/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
