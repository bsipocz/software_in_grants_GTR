system</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Intramural</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MC_UU_12016/11</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The innate immune system is vital for defence against infection by microbial pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, but if this system is deregulated, or fails to stop inflammation once it has done its job, it can cause a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. These include arthritis, asthma, colitis, lupus, psoriasis and sepsis, type 2 diabetes and even cancers of the blood, such as lymphomas. An understanding of how the immune system is switched on and switched off is therefore vital if we are going to be able to develop improved drugs for the treatment of these diseases that affect millions of individuals worldwide. 
My laboratory employs state-of-the-art technologies to study this problem and, over the past two years, three Ph.D. students working under my supervision with MRC support have made important discoveries that have identified novel components of the system and shown for the first time how they can be targeted to treat several conditions, including a type of blood cancer, called DLBCL, as well as the lethal effects of flu as well as 
sepsis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The innate immune system is vital for defence against infection by microbial pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, but the overproduction of inflammatory mediators, or the failure to resolve inflammation once it has served its purpose, causes many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. They include arthritis, asthma, colitis, lupus, psoriasis and sepsis and even blood cancers, such as lymphomas. An understanding of the signalling networks that control the production of inflammatory mediators at a molecular level is therefore critical to identify key targets for the development of drugs to boost resistance to infection or to suppress inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. 
Protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are the two key post-translational modifications that are deployed to regulate the innate immune system. The MRC supported research in my laboratory is focused on understanding how the key transcription factor NF-?B and Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs) are switched on to control the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon ??(IFN?). Over the past two years significant advances in understanding how NF-?B and the IRFs are regulated have been made by the three Ph.D. students in my lab, who are supported by MRC Unit funding. My student Sam Strickson has made important contributions towards the discovery that a hybrid ubiquitin chain, comprising both Lys63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin oligomers, is critical to switch on the I?B kinases (IKKs) that activate NF-?B and that the formation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains is a prerequisite for the formation of Met1-linked ubiquitin chains. Sam discovered that the anti-inflammatory drug BAY 11-7082 blocks the activation of the IKKs by inactivating the E2 conjugating enzymes required for the formation of Lys63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin oligomers. Excitingly, he also found that this drug is effective in destroying cancerous cells from patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, one of the least treatable forms of this blood cancer. My student Jiang Zhang has discovered that the activation of the IKKs requires two different protein kinases that phosphorylate distinct serine residues in the ?activation loops? of the IKKs, a control mechanism that may be of general significance. Another student Nazma Malik has made the unexpected discovery that a drug developed as an inhibitor of the protein kinase PLK1 for the treatment of cancer, blocks the production of IFN? during viral infection by a novel mechanism that is independent of PLK1 and which prevents the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the IFN? gene promoter. This drug and other molecules with a similar mechanism of action may have therapeutic potential for treating the lethal effects or flu and/or sepsis in which the over-production of IFN? is a major contributory factor.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>668000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pfizer Inc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>DSTT</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FB1EC5D-1329-4EB9-8C71-67BE2D8B6DC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials. The collaboration led the Unit to develop the technology of protein kinase profiling which has developed into an industry worth over &amp;pound;100 million per annum. It also led to the creation of the European Division of Upstate Incorporated in Dundee which currently employs about 50 people. The Unit's first publication on protein kinase profiling was named in 2009 by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia as Europe's most cited paper in the field of Cel Biology from 1996-2007, with over 2,200 citations. During the collaboration, the Unit has filed 36 patents and 30 licenses have been taken up by the pharmaceutical industry. The DSTT is widely regarded as a model of how academia and industry should interact for which it received a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher Education which was presented by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace in February 2006.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d597e6d11038.18487738-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Benefits from DSTT collaboration
The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

The DSTT is widely regarded as a model of how academia and industry should interact for which it received a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher Education which was presented by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace in February 2006.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5889e46879b838.01524568-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck-Serono - each company pays &amp;pound;600000 per annum over the four year period.

The open letter from 14 experts, including senior staff from all five of the country's main medical schools, said they had &amp;quot;&amp;quot;grave concerns&amp;quot;&amp;quot; that Scotland's world-leading biomedical and life sciences research would suffer if Scotland &amp;quot;&amp;quot;sleepwalks&amp;quot;&amp;quot; into leaving the UK.

The letter, coordinated by Sir David Carter, a former chief medical officer in Scotland, said Scottish universities did disproportionately well out of the UK's research funding system and from the UK's charitable and medical foundation grants.

Waldenstrom's lymphoma is caused by mutations in the protein MyD88, and 95% of the patients who are afflicted by this disease express the same mutant in which the leucine residue at position 265 is changed to proline. MyD88 is an essential adaptor protein in the signalling networks that are triggered by the binding of bacterial and viral components to Toll-Like Receptors or by the interaction of interleukins 1, 18 and 33 with their receptors.


Philip's talk to an audience that mainly comprised patients with Waldenstrom's lymphoma, their physicians, relatives and friends, focused on how MyD88 was discovered, and its key role in the innate immune system that is vital for protection against infection by microbial pathogens, especially during childhood. He also explained how the hyper-activation of the MyD88-dependent signalling network can lead to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, and how its constitutive activation caused by the MyD88[Leu265Pro] mutation leads to lymphoma. The talk was followed by a formal dinner in the Churchill rooms, at which Philip and Tricia Cohen were the guests of honour.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54205d609e4da6.54660185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with ZDF (German National Public Broadcasting) Regarding Scottish Referendum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>735FB570-C5AA-468A-BDBD-A1DA9CF8D4F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ZDF wished to interview Professor Cohen regarding the risks for life sciences in an independent Scotland for their European affairs programme that wished to discuss an economic case for and against independence.

It took place at the Dundee Science Centre and was aimed at introducing the immune system and the ways in which research is carried out in this field. The first day was targeted at primary school children and about 125 attended, whilst the second day was attended by members of the general public, mostly families.

Nicol Darling also participated in Open Doors Day in which the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee shows the general public around the building. As part of this event members of the public were invited to learn more about the research being carried out at the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit with about 100 people attending. The main topics were the brain and cancer introduced through interactive games and opther activities. 

Nicola Darling was also involved in teaching 160 S1 pupils (aged 11-12 years) at the Baldragon Academy high school. The aim of her class on was to help the students to improve their understanding of acids, alkalis and pH, and to encourage their enthusiasm for science by performing experiments. In addition Nicola demonstrated a more complex experiment and answered questions from the children about careers in science.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b1ede2947928.75232298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Drugs for the 21st Century</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8F2E52A-FC2E-495F-9492-759AE02FE7FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Philip Cohen gave a talk about kinase drug discovery to the Scotland International Group at the Gleneagles Hotel Scotland on Friday November 29th 2013.
