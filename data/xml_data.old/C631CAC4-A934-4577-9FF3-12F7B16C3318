The Network will support a rigorous, global, interdisciplinary and policy-oriented reflection on UFW. The aim is ultimately to generate crucial comparative insights into the challenges and potential of UFW regulation. The project will (1) establish an international and interdisciplinary Network of researchers and policy makers committed to an authentically global account of the regulation of UFW that fully incorporates the needs of developing countries, and (2) develop interlinked research agendas on key sites of regulatory intervention. The Strategic Network will nurture collaboration between researchers from multiple disciplines, developing countries and advanced industrialised countries, and policy-makers at all levels. The aim is to generate meaningful insights into the design and implementation of domestic and international laws. The Network will centre on Global Regulatory Challenges (GRCs) in UFW regulation, identified as among the most urgent and complex issues that face lower-income countries. Each Network Team will address labour market/regulatory phenomena in two paired countries across different income levels. The Teams will (1) map the existing 'state of the art' on the GRCs and (2) devise research strategies that can identify the most effective regulatory and policy strategies to address each, with a particular focus on developing countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UFW Network is an impact-oriented project. At the core of its objectives and activities is support for policy-actors to design regulatory interventions on unacceptable work, with a particular focus on developing countries. 

Who will benefit and how?: An Impact strategy on UFW
 
The nine Network Teams (see Case for Support, Section 3) have been designed as an extended dialogue between researchers and global and local policy actors. Each Team will be composed of 5-7 members from paired countries, 2-3 of whom will be influential policy actors. These policy actors will be drawn from domestic and multilateral bodies and selected on the basis that they represent pivotal constituencies and/or exercise a substantial influence on regulatory policy, design, or implementation. 

Network Teams will work towards co-production of research agendas. Each team will also design an Impact Pathway Strategy that will identify key policy actors and criteria for shaping Network activities in the target countries. Centrally, 'points of leverage' will be found, at which legal reforms are likely to be most feasible. These will be identified at the local level, allowing the Network Teams to respond effectively and swiftly to developments within local policy and regulatory frameworks (draft legislation, labour rights litigation, civil society campaigns etc.)

Through the impact and dissemination strategies, the Network will benefit the range of policy actors - national and transnational - that are engaged in the design, and implementation of labour regulation and pursuit of labour rights. As part of the Network-building activities of the Network (Activity 1, see Case for Support, Section 4), local partners will be identified by the Lead Researchers. Targeted beneficiaries already identified included: 

International Labour Organization, Geneva 
Greater Mekong Subregion TRIANGLE project (Tripartite Action to Protect Migrant Workers within and from the Greater Mekong Subregion from Labour Exploitation)
Forced Labour Monitoring Group (UK) 
National Commission to Eradicate Forced Labour (Brazil)
United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), Florence, Italy 
ILO/International Finance Corporation, World Bank Better Work Project
Living Wage Foundation (UK)

In conjunction with the Impact Pathway Strategies, policy partners will be integrated through the following channels:

Policy actors and policy-influential scholars will be appointed to the Network's Global Advisory Board (Case for Support, Section 3). Tentatively, Board members will include representatives of the International Labour Organization, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), European Commission Directorate-General Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), and Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), together with key UK partners.

One of the Co-Investigators - Lee - has a devoted impact role. As a key contact within the UN International Labour Organization, Lee will have a devoted role in securing global contacts (the World Bank, other UN Specialist agencies etc.) and at the national level through the ILO's network of 'constituents' (governments and employers' and workers' organizations) and broader contacts among NGOs and civil society). 

A project-specific dissemination strategy will incorporate widespread circulation of the series of Project Reports on Innovative UFW Regulation, Executive Summaries, translated into French and Spanish, a series of UFW Policy Briefs (Case for Support, Section 4). These materials will be disseminated via a devoted Network website, a UFW app, a devoted Twitter feed, and in PDF and hard copies as needed and press releases will be targeted at leading media outlets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>113084</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P007465/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>05111DBD-D3AB-4CEB-B45C-DD5885F4C460</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
