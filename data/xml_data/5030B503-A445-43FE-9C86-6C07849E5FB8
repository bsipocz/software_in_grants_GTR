&lt;p>The series begins with an event in which participants will seek clarity regarding the varying definitions of ?power? at work in debates in on this subject, and establish criteria for assessing change. At the second two seminars, participants will investigate more specifically what shift are occurring in the United States? capacities, first in terms of ?national power?, ie&amp;nbsp; resource-levels, economic size and military capabilities, and second in terms of its ?structural power?, ie its position as an agenda-setter in international institutions and its political and cultural attractiveness (?soft power?).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The fourth seminar will discuss rising powers, particularly China, and their capacity to rival the US in these areas. The concluding event of the series, hosted at Chatham House (the Royal Institute of International Affairs) will synthesis the findings of the series. The findings of the series will be presented in a Report on American Power, published at the end of the series.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The seminar series will produce and disseminate a clear, detailed and evidenced assessment of trends American relative power. Its proceedings and findings will thus be of significant value to those sectors of society for whom it is necessary to have long-term strategic foresight regarding the global distribution of power and the structure of the international environment. This dovetails with the important 'rising powers' agenda, which represents another facet of the same process.

1. UK government departments.
- Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office
- Ministry of Defence
The primary users and beneficiaries of the series would be government officials with responsibility for grand strategy, relations with the United States, or regions and policy areas theatres where US power is significant. Interest from the FCO in such research has already been expressed through their academic liaison officer, who will of course be invited to attend all events.

2. Policy research organisations within the UK, US and abroad.
This encompasses think-tanks such as Chatham House, RUSI, IISS. It also includes professional associations, chiefly the British International Studies Association, of which the Principal Applicant is an executive committee member and which is chaired by a Co-Applicant (Parmar), and its US Foreign Policy working group, which is convened by the PA. Engagement through the series would serve to build and sustain links between these organisations, enhancing national research capacity on a topic of key strategic priority.

3. US Government and foreign policy community.
Because of its US focus, series outputs will have relevance to the American policy community, and also to a range of other governments for whom the shifting distribution of power is significant. This will contribute not only to better-informed policymaking among our allies, but will also boost the UK's reputation as a source of internationally policy-relevant research of the highest quality. It will also promote ties between UK researchers and their home institutions and those of other nations, most especially the United States, e.g. with universities such as George Washington University and Boston University with which Warwick already has close formal links.

5. The commercial and financial sector.
This includes defence and associated export industries, as well as banks, trading firms, etc., involved in activities dependent upon international distribution of power. Series outputs, including assessments of defence spending trends and areas of economic growth and contraction, will provide valuable inputs for strategic assessment of market trends. This could also enhance esteem for UK political science in the commercial sector by demonstrating the viability of academic institutional collaboration as a source of concretely useful analysis.

6. Media covering international affairs.
This includes print (Times, Guardian, Telegraph), news weeklies (Economist) and those smaller publications devoted exclusively to foreign affairs (Foreign Policy), as well as radio (BBC R4) and television (Newsnight, C4 News), and new media, such as foreign policy blogs (e.g. Washington Note). All have a record of attendance at UK-based foreign and security policy conferences, especially at LSE and Chatham House. The series will engage the media both through attendance at series events presenting opportunities for direct reportage, and via written outputs and ongoing social media updates on proceedings. This will contribute to informed coverage of important international trends.

7. The general public.
The series will seek to engage the public in its work through a comprehensive communication strategy (see Pathways), raising awareness of key issues and seeking to elevate and inform public discourse. This will be aided by engagement with NGOs, civil society and social movements, e.g. British American Security Information Council, the 'Occupy' movement, Stop the War Coalition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As noted in the Key Findings section, this award was for a seminar series on 'The Future of American Power' which consisted of six events (see full list saved under 'engagement activities' section of portfolio) bringing together collaborators from around the UK and USA. By creating and fostering connection and dialogue between these groups through to arriving at the key findings, a core purpose of the series was fulfilled.

As a seminar series, it served primarily to clarify the terms of debate and to foster networks rather than to establish definitive conclusions on matters of reasonable dispute. Nevertheless, it did generate Key Finding, which are listed in that section. 

One major vehicle for dissemination was a key research paper by the Principal Investigator Adam Quinn published and distributed via Chatham House. http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20150109ObamaNationalSecurityQuinn.pdf

The second is a co-authored article (Adam Quinn and co-investigator Nicholas Kitchen). targeted at International Affairs, the leading UK journal for foreign policy. This is in advanced draft stage and we aspire to publish in the first half of 2016.

The research paper was circulated widely in hard copy and online to think tanks, scholars, and government officials in the UK and US. It was, by Chatham House statistics, their most-downloaded research paper published for several months. It therefore successfully penetrated its targeted policy circles and contributed to their assessments of the future direction of US strategy and the appropriate response to it. It was linked to by the Council on Foreign Relations, the leading foreign affairs think tank in the United States. Positive feedback was received by the author from a senior former government official. It is expected that the second key output will receive similar circulation when published.

The series also succeeded in the objective for Seminar Series of consolidating networks between junior scholars, senior scholars and the non-academic world. The junior scholars named as co-investigators in the original bid are now all employed full-time at leading higher education institutions. The contacts established with senior scholars have led to major grant applications for projects on related themes. Close dialogue with Chatham House, the non-academic co-investigator institution in the bid, has been continuous, including discussions over mechanisms for connecting postgraduate researchers to the think tank and policy worlds.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>072787FD-B6A1-4832-9FCF-2246FD4559E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56744727a5ec83.08994656</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award was for a seminar series on 'The Future of American Power' which consisted of six events (see full list saved under 'engagement activities' section of portfolio) bringing together collaborators from around the UK and USA. As a seminar series, it serves primarily to clarify the terms of debate and to foster networks rather than to establish definitive conclusions on matters of reasonable dispute. Within that context, the key findings were:
1. The power of the United States relative to rising powers, measured in conventional terms, will be determined by unfolding trends in certain key areas: the continuation or otherwise of differential levels of national economic growth; the capacity of the US Government to allocate resources to maintaining military superiority at present levels in light of competing demands for resource allocation; whether the qualitative advantage of the US economy in generating innovation can be sustained, and the connection of this to the economic and political model of the US compared with that of the leading rising powers; demographic trends, especially the question of whether rising-power populations may begin to age before they have attained parity in wealth with the US; the extent to which domestic political consensus can be maintained within the US for spending on overseas national security

2. There is also significant debate surrounding not the direction of current trends, but the nature and meaning of the conception of 'power' relevant to forward-looking international comparisons. In particular, in addition to conventional measures of its capacities, the United States possesses advantages in the following areas: its centrality to a complex web of international networks, economic, diplomatic and cultural; the appeal of aspects of its culture and politics to foreign audiences, i.e. 'soft power'; the extent to which individuals based in the United States may be the ultimate owners of economic assets that appear in national GDP counts as foreign assets, and the extent to which this should be considered a facet of US power; the extent to which the existing, broadly liberal, norms and institutions of world order lock in US preferences, values and practices and will continue to do so after decline in US global GDP share or military advantage.

3. US strategists must make their decisions in the context of uncertainty regarding the trends listed above in (1), and consider how the issues raised in (2) do and do not affect their calculations regarding the possibility and desirability of maintaining US primacy in the face of rising power. To some extent there is consensus within US politics regarding the desirability of maintaining US 'leadership', but there is identifiable disagreement regarding the force with which the United States can or should resist the emergence of a world order based around a multipolar distribution of power rather than a hegemonic order premised upon exceptional status for the United States. The outcome of these political disagreements may be highly significant for the future of world order.

4. The series brought together scholarly experts and early-career researchers working on US foreign policy from the UK and the USA as well as think tank researchers and past and present of the US and UK government/policy staff who otherwise would not have had the resources to meet, with the initial ESRC grant more than doubled by cumulative matching funds from host institutions to generate the total series event budget. This facilitated and fostered connections between these groups, with one notable output being the connection between the principal investigator, Dr Adam Quinn, and Chatham House (the Royal Institute for International Affairs) that allowed the key research paper output for the series to be published and distributed via that institution. http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20150109ObamaNationalSecurityQuinn.pdf</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Seminar series events were attended by a mixture of established and early career scholars from the UK and US, think tank researchers and representatives of past and present US and UK government staff. The subject focus of the series was clearly and closely linked to matters of direct interest to government. One key step which has already been taken since the end of the series is the publication of a Chatham House (Royal Institute for International Affairs) research paper authored by this series principal investigator (which notes as appropriate the role of this ESRC grant in allowing it to be published. This was circulated widely in hard copy and online to think tanks, scholars, and government officials in the UK and US and was, by Chatham House figures, their most-downloaded research paper published for many months. Thus a major output that would not have been generated without the series has been disseminated widely beyond academia. It is planned to complement this with the publication of a scholarly article synthesising the series' key findings, being co-authored by the principal investigator and one co-investigator (Kitchen) in 2015.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6A2796A6-B5BD-4197-B293-FF3B25F89C90</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5515574cd1fe21.08698376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J022284/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
