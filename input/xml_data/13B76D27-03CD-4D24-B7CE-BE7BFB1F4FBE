This book aims to foster interest in major German repertoire that is unknown to most English-speaking audiences, with a view to encouraging more performances of this music. The recent deaths of Gyorgy Ligeti, Mauricio Kagel and Karlheinz Stockhausen indicate that an era is drawing to a close, thereby focusing more attention on the successors to these composers. Accordingly, this book provides the first substantial English-language coverage of Wolfgang Rihm (born 1952) and Helmut Lachenmann (born 1935), who have been the most prominent figures in Germany in recent years. Instead of focusing on the post-war years, this volume aims to look at the later music of more senior figures such as Karlheinz Stockhausen (who taught Rihm) and Hans Werner Henze from the perspectives of Rihm and Lachenmann. Furthermore, it also considers the music of their contemporaries, such as Walter Zimmermann, while also examining music by more junior composers, such as Matthias Pintscher and Isabel Mundry. \n\nInitially, Lachenmann might be heard as a formidable figure, since his 'refusal of habit' (his refusal to rely on established conventions and meanings) leaves space for few familiar sounds in his music. For example, we hear the bodies of string instruments being bowed, and we hear the hissing of breath being blown through wind instruments. However, these techniques, which arose from the political context of the student protests in 1968, are exciting to watch and produce very colourful sounds. Moreover, this 'refusal of habit' took a more political form in the music of associated composers such as Mathias Spahlinger and Nicolaus A. Huber, who attacked a range of musical conventions.\n\nRihm's 'aesthetic of inclusion', by contrast, contains recognizable elements that are derived from established composers such as Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann, but they are encountered in unexpected and stimulating contexts that invite us to interpret the past in new ways. For example, his 'Musik fuer Drei Streicher', which compares favourably with other chamber music for strings from the twentieth century, alludes to Beethoven in a way that takes established gestures in new directions. Furthermore, his recent stage work 'Das Gehege' (The Enclosure), which interacts with the music of Richard Strauss, is highly topical because it is about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Older composers such as Dieter Schnebel and Mauricio Kagel also engaged with music of the past, but sometimes did so in a more confrontational manner, as heard for instance in Kagel's 'Ludwig Van', which asks performers to play fragments of Beethoven in any order. More conciliatory responses to tradition are, however, heard in the music of contemporaries of Rihm such as Detlef Muller-Siemens, and in the music of younger figures such as Isabel Mundry.\n\nFinally, the project also considers the institutions such as orchestras, radio stations and music festivals that supported music in West Germany in the post-war years. After German reunification, funding for new music in Germany became more competitive, as it became unnecessary to support culture as a marker of western freedom.\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? \n\nThis research project Music in Germany since 1968 will benefit the wider concert-going public: (1) by encouraging more performances of the relevant repertoire; and (2) by providing information about this repertoire when it is performed. \n\nThe project will also benefit institutions associated with the arts: the monograph will provide an important resource for the Goethe Institute to promote German culture in English-speaking nations, and it will also encourage the arts organizations to fund performances of the music discussed. Likewise, it will give orchestral and ensemble management, as well as individual performers, more confidence in programming this music. \n\nHow will they benefit from this research? \n\nThe monograph Music in Germany since 1968 will be of interest potentially to all the beneficiaries listed above. Activities deriving from this book include concert programme notes, pre-concert talks, advice on programming, and media contributions. These are not listed as outputs in the application because invitations cannot be guaranteed. \n\nThe project will add to the cultural range of concert programming in the UK, ensuring that it continues to be perceived as of international significance. It will be appreciated by the Goethe Institute because it will increase the profile of German music in English-speaking nations. It will also help to improve Anglo-German relations, partly by moving away from a focus on the Second-World War. The project also has affinities with the AHRC's emerging theme of 'Translating Cultures', since it is partly about translating German culture, and partly about how music of the past is engaged by more recent music.\n\nPerformers and composers are to be found in academic and non-academic environments. In either case, they will especially appreciate information on the practicalities of the extended techniques deployed in Lachenmann's scores, and on the composer's motivations for using them.\n\nIt is highly likely that a range of beneficiaries, including newspapers, will be seeking information on Wolfgang Rihm in 2012 since he will be 60 that year. This event will consolidate his reputation as a world-leading composer. \n\nWhat will be done to ensure they benefit from this research? \n\nI have already written two programme notes on Wolfgang Rihm for the London Sinfonietta, which demonstrates that I have a track record in this area, and that I am perceived as an authoritative communicator. There is every chance that I will be asked to undertake more work in this area.\n\nOn March 12 and 13, 2010, there will be three concerts, which will be recorded by BBC Radio 3, given at the Barbican, London, devoted to the music of Rihm. The participating ensembles will be the Arditti Quartet, the London Sinfonietta and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. As part of this 'Total Immersion' festival, I shall chair an event at the Institute for Musical Research, School of Advanced Study, University of London, which will include Wolfgang Rihm and a member of the Arditti Quartet as panel members. While this event will attract an academic audience, it will also be aimed at members of the public who will be attending concerts the following weekend. \n\nI shall give a presentation on the piano music of Wolfgang Rihm and Helmut Lachenmann on 24 February 2010 at Keele University, which will be open to the campus community and to the wider public. I shall press for a comparable event to take place in February 2011, during the course of the proposed Fellowship.\n\nDuring the proposed Fellowship, I shall contact the Goethe Institute in order to draw attention to Rihm's 60th birthday in 2012, and to indicate that my book will be published in the same year. With the support of the Goethe Institute, I shall encourage UK arts organizations to programme Rihm's music, as well as the music of associ</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38790</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I I gave a lecture-recital to mark Rihm's 60th birthday in March 2012 with the Goethe-Institut London and the Royal College of Music.

It significantly expands knowledge because there is no other general study of this area and because it has opened up an area of contemporary musical life to an English-speaking audience. Furthermore, it enhances understanding by revealing the extent to which composers who emerged after 1968 have shifted away from the serial generation. It challenges a historiographic approach which emphasizes the twenty years of post-war reconstruction by using the social movements of 1968 as a way of moving beyond the prevalent doctrine of technical progress. On the one hand, this turn encouraged socially critical music in Germany. On the other hand, it indirectly enabled composers to respond to the past hermeneutically as they became less obsessed with inventing material.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The primary academic readership for this volume will be musicologists working in the field of twentieth-century and contemporary music, who wish to become better acquainted with recent music from Germany. It will also offer an important resource for composers who want to know more about figures in contemporary German music they have hitherto only encountered in a piecemeal fashion. Likewise, performers will also wish to gain further information about the principles underlying key contemporary repertoire.

The monograph will be informative for scholars of modern German and European culture, especially those working in the fields of theatre and visual art. The book is timely because it will be of interest to those considering the cultural ramifications of the end of the Cold War and the realignment of Europe after the collapse of communism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1DA05D64-070C-4D35-9B3A-074A5456C32F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cedff178ae98.12210006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9F1D62B4-0802-43FB-AD12-81C277049DC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Music in Germany since 1968</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c"><gtr:id>9c717571939f0b653a6412ed81f1b20c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-521-87759-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5453752af125a4.20035942</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H038868/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
