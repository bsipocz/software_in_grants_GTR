Approach</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N003128/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is a major international human rights treaty to which the UK is a signatory. The UK will soon be formally reviewed by the CRPD treaty body (the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) in order to assess UK progress towards CRPD-compliance. 

This AHRC impact and engagement project will support the UK's preparation for the UN Engagement Process. It will ensure that the UK representative is informed by recent research on legal and ethical issues pertaining to CRPD-compliance, and it will co-ordinate a series of consultations to develop a broad consensus as to the best path towards CRPD-compliance in the UK.

The project will focus upon the provisions of law in three distinct legal jurisdictions (England &amp;amp; Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) as regards persons with impaired decision-making capacity.

Some persons with disabilities suffer from impaired decision-making capacity. A person suffering from dementia may have difficulty thinking through important financial information; a person with a learning disability may not be able to make decisions about medical treatment; a person with a brain injury may not be able to make a decision about a proposed settlement from an insurance company, etc. 

In the UK, legal arrangements governing such circumstances are devolved. There is one statute that governs England and Wales: The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). In Scotland, the Adults with Incapacity Act 2000 (AWI) applies. In Northern Ireland, matters pertaining to adult incapacity are currently governed by case law, but a new piece of legislation is being prepared for consideration by the Northern Ireland Assembly. 

This legal diversity presents both a challenge and an opportunity. 

The challenge is to ensure that the UK representative in the UN Engagement Process has the benefit of adequate research as regards progress towards CRPD compliance across the UK. 

The opportunity is to use this legal diversity as a tool in identifying the best ways to deal with circumstances of incapacity while ensuring respect for the rights of persons with disabilities and compliance with the UK's obligations under the CRPD.

The issues around compliance with the CRPD are sensitive and contentious, and the stakes are high. For example, in England and Wales, the MCA provides for &amp;quot;best-interests decision-making&amp;quot; on behalf of persons lacking in decision-making capacity. In Scotland, the AWI avoids any mention of &amp;quot;best interests.&amp;quot; The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has maintained that &amp;quot;the best interests paradigm must be abolished.&amp;quot; Does this mean that England and Wales must repeal or amend the MCA? If so, does the AWI present a better alternative? What strategy should Northern Ireland adopt, as it prepares to legislate on this matter?

The AHRC-funded Essex Autonomy Project (EAP) is an interdisciplinary research and public policy initiative with expertise on the ethical and legal imperative to respect the autonomy of persons suffering from mental disorders or other mental impairments. It has played a key role in educating policy makers about the legal and ethical challenges associated with CRPD-compliance. In 2014, the EAP co-ordinated a consultation exercise and provided technical research support to the UK Ministry of Justice in developing a formal legal opinion as to whether the MCA is compliant with the CRPD -- and about what to do if it is not. In this project the EAP team will collaborate with the Centre for Mental Health and Incapacity Law, Rights and Policy (Edinburgh Napier University) in order to assess CRPD-compliance on mental capacity/adult incapacity across all three jurisdictions of the UK. The project will ensure that the UK is prepared for the UN Engagement Process, and contribute to the international reform of law and practice as regards persons with impaired decision-making capacity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has a distinctive set of impact opportunities occasioned by the upcoming UN review of UK compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). 

The EAP research team already has established working relationships with Westminster officials who will play a role in preparing for the UK's appearance before the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. These include: Joan Goulbourn and Liz Eaton (Capacity Leads at Ministry of Justice), Niall Fry (Capacity Lead at the Department of Health), Denzil Lush (Senior Judge of the Court of Protection, England and Wales), Alan Eccles (The Public Guardian, England &amp;amp; Wales). We will extend our collaborations with these individuals, many of whom played substantial roles in the 2014 EAP consultation roundtables regarding the Mental Capacity Act (England &amp;amp; Wales). 

The EAP will collaborate with the Centre for Mental Health and Incapacity Law, Rights and Policy, Edinburgh Napier University. The Centre has established working relationships with key officials in Scottish Government and civil service positions who are directly engaged with the challenges of achieving CRPD-compliance. These include Sandra McDonald (The Public Guardian, Scotland), Colin McKay (Chief Executive of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland), Hilary Third (Adult Incapacity Lead in the Equality Unit, Scottish Government), and Adrian Ward (Law Society of Scotland and Scottish Law Commission). It was a group of these individuals who originally proposed extending the EAP's 2014 consultation project on the MCA so as to cover the corresponding legislation in Scotland. These individuals will participate directly in project events, and will be well-placed to take forward any recommendations from the project regarding CRPD-compliance in Scotland.

The project team has developing relationships with relevant public officials in Northern Ireland. A key individual in the ongoing reform of mental health legislation in Northern Ireland is Allison McCaffrey, who serves as Principal of the Mental Capacity Legislation Unit for the Department for Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland. McCaffrey closely followed the findings of the 2014 EAP consultation process regarding the CRPD and the Mental Capacity Act of England and Wales, and flew from Belfast to London to attend the final conference from the 2014 project. Along with McCaffrey, we will work with two individuals with close knowledge of the legislative reform underway in Northern Ireland: Colin Caughey (Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission) and Iris Elliott (Mental Health Foundation, formerly Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health). Caughey will serve as an advisor on the project, and Elliott as a paid consultant. We will use these three contacts to ensure that deliberations by the Northern Ireland Assembly over the proposed new unified mental health bill are informed by the findings of the consultation process.

As the UN Engagement Process formally gets underway, Her Majesty's Government (HMG) will name an individual to represent the UK in the process and appear in person before the CRPD treaty body in Geneva. Niall Fry (Department of Health) has agreed to assist us in approaching the UK representative once identified. We will provide that individual with outputs from the consultation process and make the project research team available to address any outstanding research questions.

Internationally, we have already been contacted by public officials in (inter alia) Norway, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland who wish to be kept apprised of project findings. Our &amp;quot;Fringe Event&amp;quot; in Geneva will provide a mechanism to ensure broad international dissemination of project findings to public officials and opinion-shapers around the world who are directly involved in an unprecedented world-wide reform of legislation pertaining to persons who may suffer from impaired decision-making capacity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63828</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mental Health Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mental Health Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:id>9759FECB-7C4C-4DE6-81B9-0E6388B6D265</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is still in progress, so outputs will be appearing for the next reporting period.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e013a5d60aa5.60780530-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Mental Health Foundation are contributing their expertise in mental health issues, particularly the perspective of service users.

The report is the culmination of a collaborative sixteen-month project undertaking an assessment of capacity/adult incapacity legislation in the three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom: England &amp;amp; Wales (which together comprise one jurisdiction for these purposes), Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It is intended (i) to provide technical research support to UK officials who will be involved in the forthcoming UN review of UK compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD); (ii) to make recommendations in support of ongoing efforts across the UK to reform capacity/adult incapacity legislation in order to achieve CRPD compliance; and (iii) to provide analysis, both of current legislation and possible alternatives, that will be useful to those around the world who are involved in the reform of mental health and mental capacity legislation in accordance with the human rights requirements of the CRPD. 

Compliance with the CRPD is a work-in-progress in the three jurisdictions of the UK, and this work must continue. We identify a number of recent legislative innovations that have the potential to bring the UK closer to compliance. We consider measures commonly employed in the three jurisdictions but hitherto hardly addressed in discussion of CRPD compliance, in particular autonomous measures such as powers of attorney and advance directives, which present particular challenges and opportunities in the context of CRPD compliance. We also identify a number of other areas in which the statutory arrangements in the UK still fall short of compliance with CRPD Art. 12. We advance a series of recommendations about how the three UK jurisdictions can remedy these areas of non-compliance. 

The main recommendations of the report are as follows:

Recommendation 1: Respect for the full range of the rights, will and preferences of everyone must lie at the heart of every legal regime. That must be achieved regardless of the existence and nature of any disabilities. Achieving such respect must be the prime responsibility of anyone who has a role in taking action or making a decision, with legal effect, on behalf of a person whose ability to take that action or make that decision is impaired. The role may arise from authorisation or obligation. The individual with that role should be obliged to operate with the rebuttable presumption that effect should be given to the person's reasonably ascertainable will and preferences, subject to the constraints of possibility and non-criminality. That presumption should be rebuttable only if stringent criteria are satisfied. Action which contravenes the person's known will and preferences should only be permissible if it is shown to be a proportional and necessary means of effectively protecting the full range of the person's rights, freedoms and interests.

Recommendation 2: All three UK capacity/adult incapacity statutes should incorporate an attributable duty to undertake all practicable steps to determine the will and preferences of persons with disabilities in applying any measure designed to respond to impairments in that person's capabilities. 

Recommendation 3: In any process that impacts upon the ability of a person with disability to exercise their legal capacity, the primary obligation of an independent advocate shall be to support the person to overcome obstacles to such matters as comprehension or communication so as to enable them to exercise that capacity for themselves. If such support does not secure the independent exercise of their legal capacity, the duty of the advocate shall be to support the person by identifying and articulating, insofar as it is practicable to do so, the will and preferences of the disabled person in the matter.

Recommendation 4: Statutory advocacy services should be funded at a level that ensures genuine and effective access to independent advocates by persons with disabilities in any matter that impacts upon their ability to exercise legal capacity.

Recommendation 5: The scope of statutory requirements regarding the provision of support should be expanded to encompass support for the exercise of legal capacity, not simply support for communication (as in AWIA s1(6)) or support for decision-making capacity (as in MCA s1(3)).
Recommendation 6: Statutory provisions regarding support in the exercise of legal capacity must be attributable. For example, statutes that state only that support should be provided must be supplemented with clear guidance about who bears the responsibility for providing that support.

Recommendation 7: Existing measures such as powers of attorney and advance directives should be recognised for their potential as instruments of support for the exercise of legal agency in circumstances where decision-specific decision-making capacity is impaired, intermittent or absent. In order to fulfil this potential, however, such measures must be embedded in robust Art. 12.4 safeguards. 

Recommendation 8: The three jurisdictions should develop definitions (and related guidance) on the concepts of undue influence and conflicts of interest which will be suitable for providing robust safeguards across all aspects of exercise of legal capacity, and in so doing should include consideration of weaving in aspects of related concepts such as &amp;quot;facility, circumvention, lesion&amp;quot; in Scots law and &amp;quot;unconscionable bargains&amp;quot; in English law. 

Recommendation 9: Principal capacity/adult incapacity legislation should be structured to ensure that provisions and procedures necessary to ensure CRPD compliance apply throughout each respective legal system, and not only to measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity contained within the principal legislation.

Recommendation 10: A regular programme of monitoring and review should be maintained to review compliance with capacity/adult incapacity legislation in all three jurisdictions of the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have been submitted staff at the Ministry of Justice and are being disseminated by the research team to contacts at the UN, in Human Rights
