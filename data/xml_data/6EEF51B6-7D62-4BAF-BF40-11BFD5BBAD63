In the last twenty years therapies have developed that are effective in improving life expectancy and quality of life. Modern treatment has dramatically changed the outlook for those with HIV however no method has yet been found of eliminating the virus from an infected person. Standard treatment can reduce the amount of virus in the blood to near undetectable levels, however as soon as treatment is stopped the virus returns. This ability for the virus to evade treatment has been attributed to a phenomenon called latency. When HIV infects a cell it inserts its genetic material into the DNA of the host cell. Under normal circumstances this inserted DNA is unwittingly read by the host cell and in doing so it produces new copies of the virus. The integrated DNA stays with the host cell for the remainder of its lifespan. Occasionally the virus has inserted itself into the host DNA but its genetic material is not being read. Thus we have a cell that is infected and contains all the information needed to produce new HIV viruses but is silent. This state of silence is known as latency. The most significant population of cells containing latent HIV is thought to be among T-cells (cells of the immune system targeted by HIV). T-cells have two states; an active state and a resting state. Resting T-cells have a long lifespan meaning that, once latently infected, resting T-cells form a lasting reservoir of hidden virus. The complete mechanism by which the viral DNA remains silent is not fully understood but a number of processes are thought to be involved. Crucially the virus in latently infected cells is not susceptible to standard anti-HIV drugs. These cells are also not vulnerable to those parts of the immune system whose role is to recognise and kill infected cells. A number of compounds have been found which have been shown to rouse the virus from latency in laboratory models. None has yet been shown to eliminate the virus from infected patients however trials have so far focused on a single group of agents only. It seems likely that a combination of compounds targeting different mechanisms of latency will be needed to completely purge the reservoir. We propose to examine the effect of different combinations of agents using a laboratory model of HIV latency. In doing so we will assess the relative efficiency of different combinations as reactivators of latent HIV. We seek to understand whether multiple agents are more successful and if so which combination of activators is the best. We plan a series of experiments to evaluate what is happening to inside the cells in response to activation. Specifically we will investigate how factors believed to have a role in latency are modified by these compounds. By builiding a detailed picture of which processes are involved we will be able to understand which is most important in the control of latent HIV. In addition, we will develop a method of determining whether the cells in which viral replication is reactivated are killed by the immune system. In showing this we will help to validate the hypothesis that reactivating latent HIV will aid the immune system in clearing the virus from the body. The research we plan will provide guidance for future studies that may examine the use of multiple anti-latency agents in infected individuals. Ultimately it will contribute to our understanding of how elimination of HIV can be achieved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Reactivation of latent HIV from resting CD4+ cells is likely to be required for elimination of HIV. The exact mechanisms by which transcriptional silence is maintained are not fully understood nor has the optimal method of reactivation from latency been found. We will develop viral vectors that express deltaNGFR as a surface marker to enable detection of reactivation and sorting of live cells. This will permit us to create a primary cell model of latency, in addition to the established J-Lat model, in which we can study the effect of reactivating agents when used sequentially. We will stimulate cells using a range of activators in different combinations. In addition to the proportion of cells reactivated by each combination of agents we wish to understand their effect on a cellular level. We will explore the relative importance of different mechanisms of latency. Specifically, we will use ChiP assays to evaluate the acetylation and methylation state of histones formed within the LTR of HIV. Using quantitative PCR we will examine the effect on the proportion of RNA transcripts that are completed. Using methylation specific PCR we will evaluate the effect of DNA methylation on reactivation. We will develop a novel assay to evaluate killing by HIV specific CD8+ cells. Clearance of reactivated cells cultured with reactive CD8+ cells will be assessed by quantitative PCR over a time course. By correlating the results of the above experiments will we gain an understanding of which cellular processes need to by targeted to produce the greatest reactivation response and the greatest response from the immune system.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are close to 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK. The cost of antiretroviral therapy for one year is approximately &amp;pound;20,000. The total cost of HIV to the UK economy has been estimated at close to &amp;pound;1 billion. Although the primary beneficiaries of the proposed research are other researchers in the field of virology it forms part of the global effort to eradicate HIV infection. Improved health outcomes for those living with HIV will have a huge societal and economic impact. 

This work will form a model for screening and evaluating new anti-latency compounds. As such it has the potential to inform the work of pharmaceutical industry in developing new drugs. Should novel therapeutic strategies evolve from this research the benefits to those living with HIV and to the economy are clear.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201940</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>46A54D19-EC1C-4191-8A6C-F5940E4E056E</gtr:id><gtr:title>No evidence of ongoing evolution in replication competent latent HIV-1 in a patient followed up for two years.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a64c125c12f8d154f93b9d59d6f280c"><gtr:id>5a64c125c12f8d154f93b9d59d6f280c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mok HP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d2f13551729.35285187</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCC35872-C19E-4C7E-B595-616E52B0CD55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Innovations in the quantitative virus outgrowth assay and its use in clinical trials.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Retrovirology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7b3e5d7dd242515176af27a31cf83562"><gtr:id>7b3e5d7dd242515176af27a31cf83562</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Norton NJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-4690</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a616a103174e0.41934862</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M003515/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
