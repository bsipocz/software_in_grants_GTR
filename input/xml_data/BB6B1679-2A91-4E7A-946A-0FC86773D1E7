Full time (30-48 Months), part time (60-96 Months) or collaborative options are available. The EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) supports training opportunities across a broad range of subjects including Electronics, Physics, Chemistry, Civil/Chemical/Mechanical/Aerospace/Environmental Engineering, Computing, Mathematics, Sociology and Psychology. The University maintains a research directory (www.surrey.ac.uk/research) and more details on postgraduate research opportunities by subject here www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/research.
The DTP provides funding for excellence in terms of research topic and candidate. PGRs studying for a PhD typically start in Oct but studentships are advertised throughout the year on the universities website (https://jobs.surrey.ac.uk/) as well as external subject dependant press. However, high calibre students can apply for funded positions at any time by contacting the relevant units of research (www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/research). General enquires should be addressed to admissions@surrey.ac.uk or for DTP specific opportunities to FEPS-gradschool@surrey.ac.uk. Funding is normally provided for 36 months with the opportunity to apply for up to a 6 month extension.
As well as offering a high quality research training experience, our DTPs have the following features. 
 Industrial collaboration. Industrial collaboration pervades all aspects of work at Surrey. Almost all our UG courses offer an optional year-long industry placement. Over the last 5 years we have worked with more than 2,300 employers and are regularly in the top two Higher Education Institutions for graduate employability. We were pioneers in postgraduate training and have championed the Engineering Doctorate. We emphasise the value of industrial collaboration within the DTP offering part-funded collaborative PhD and CASE studentships. Companies interested in collaborative postgraduate research should contact either a member of staff in a relevant subject area or FEPS-gradschool@surrey.ac.uk.
 Doctoral Prizes. Doctoral training prizes provide the opportunity for high calibre scientists to start their academic careers following completion of a PhD. Each year we fund 3 or 4 prizes to retain leading stars and attract new talent to Surrey with a view to generating impact from their research. Potential candidates should contact FEPS-gradschool@surrey.ac.uk.
 Vacation Bursaries. DTP funding also provides up to 15 vacation bursaries which are offered to budding new scientists during their undergraduate studies. These bursaries provide a 10 week summer placement in a research environment to experience life at the coal face of research and gain work experience not on offer outside of academia. Interested students should contact a member of staff in a relevant subject area as applications need to be endorsed by a member of staff (see www.surrey.ac.uk/research).
Researcher Development Programme (RDP): provides a range of workshops and support mechanisms for both PhD postgraduate and early career researchers. It has twice been shortlisted for the THE awards. To choose just two areas of note, there are workshops that specifically help with the PhD (thesis writing, managing supervisors, viva process) as well as those developing broader transferable skills (presentation skills, CV writing, impact). The RDP team also provide one-to-one support. To find out more visit www.surrey.ac.uk/library/research/ 
While the majority of DTP funding is allocated to UK students, funding is available to support high calibre candidates from overseas. These studentships are highly competitive and selected by internal competition. It is therefore important that candidates apply early in the academic year (autumn) to identify a suitable project and supervisor. The selection process runs in February for an October start of the same year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2344056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509772/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
