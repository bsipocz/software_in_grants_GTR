The new system will incorporate new single particle polarization detector technology into an existing airborne certified single particle backscatter spectrometer that has been developed for commercial airliners. The target for the demonstrator will initially be the commercial airline industry, with a focus on contributing to civil aircraft safety and Government contingency applications, but it will also serve for global atmospheric research and monitoring applications, e.g. to assist assessment of the impact of aircraft operations on the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere region. It will also improve meteorological information currently broadcast via the World Meteorological Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) system from commercial aircraft as well as the UK Science community by providing enhanced measurement capability to their research aircraft. 

An existing aircraft test bed, the FAAM BAe 146 research aircraft, operated jointly by the UK Meteorological Office and NERC, and which operates under civil aircraft rules, has already been identified for the demonstration/flight validation aspect of the proposed work. An existing measurement system we propose to base the new novel demonstrator on is already flying on this aircraft. We therefore propose to use the FAAM BAe 146 platform to flight validate the new measurement system to minimize costs. The existing system, a miniature non-flow invasive backscatter cloud spectrometer (BCP-100) was developed for the European Research Infrastructure Programme, IAGOS (In-Service Aircraft for Global Observing System), Figure 1. This has already received European Supplemental Type Certification (STC) approval for operation on Airbus A-320 series civil airliners as a component of the IAGOS instrument package programme and this will be expanded to other Airbus types, including A320/40, as IAGOS increases its fleet. The current Airbus platforms with their novel miniature IAGOS instrument packages will also offer a guaranteed future market base for the new system via upgrades and replacements, which will be managed by IAGOS and its extensive links with commercial carriers. Subsequent demonstration of the new system in this high profile environment for both airline safety and improved weather prediction and climate monitoring applications will be used to expand potential market for this system to other aircraft manufacturers with whom IAGOS is already in discussion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Disruption to livelihood of volcanic ash plumes have had a very significant impact on the UK and its commercial activities recently. The social and economic consequences of such events, episodic though they are, world wide - have become high in the public conscious and a focus for media and government attention and resources. The eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj&amp;ouml;kull closed airspace all over Europe due to the presence of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere (up to 55,000 feet). This lead to losses in excess of 1 billion Euros to the European civil aviation industries with equivalent losses due to commercial disruption that resulted. These events lead to headline news stories over prolonged periods and the convening of the governments' civic contingencies committee which struggled to quantify safe fly zones, arguments which rumbled on throughout the year. The high-profile nature of such events has generated many in the aviation industry to seek help from the atmospheric science community to evaluate ash levels using instruments mounted on commercial airliners. This has inspired this project's Impact Plan. This has three levels: 1) a significant and enhanced collaboration with the industrial partner DMT, a world leading developer of aircraft instrumentation,2) maintenance of the UK-NERC contribution to the European IAGOS infrastructure which has extensive links with Arbus Industries and manage the new atmospheric composition monitoring instrument packages now being installed on Lufthansa, Air France and China Airline Airbus which will report on greenhouse gases, aerosols and clouds via the WMO AMDAR system.3) educationally-focussed outreach programme is already in place through EUFAR aimed at research students interested in aircraft based research exemplified by the recent successful Airborne Research for the Environment ICARE-EUFAR, Toulouse, 2010. Through our continued commitment to IAGOS and FAAM instrument development expertise will be delivered tocourse within this structure. In addition secondary school students will benefit through outreach programmes at the University of Manchester disseminating our findings to encourage greater interest in atmospehric science and instrumentation using airborne platforms to encourage this interest.
This programme will cement collaborations aready in place with FAAM, UK Met Office and NCAS-FGAM. This collaboration will be mutually beneficial. NCAS, and in return the Met Office will be benefiting from valuable data sets, equipment testing and scientific discoveries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Global climate change represents arguably the most serious environmental issue facing mankind today, with implications for global political stability and the global economy. Reliable predictions of the future climate using climate models are central and fundamental requirements for determining future mitigation strategies. The use of commercial aircraft allows the collection of highly relevant observations on a scale and in numbers impossible to achieve using research aircraft, and where other measurement methods (e.g., satellites) have technical limitations. This new technology is being evaluated for installation on commercial passenger aircraft as part of the IAGOS global climate measurement aircraft fleet.

Discussions are now taking place within the IAGOS European Infrastructure to eventually replace the current fleet of dust/cloud spectrometers flown on a number of commercial Airbus passenger aircraft by Lufthansa, Iberia, China Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Air France with this new instrument to improve particle discrimination for both dust prone operating environments (for engine maintenance) and high ice impacts on operations. 
We have also been contacted by spin off companies (e.g. Satavia) with regard access to data products to evaluate in cockpit route optimisation in the face of high ice conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A957BE85-44BC-42D6-9655-70B10991FC4A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54453c690068a7.01968162</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A new autonomous instrument for detecting cloud water, ice and dust particles.

More than 60 cloud measurement experts and students from Europe, America, Asia and Australia participated in the workshop with the objectives to summarise current data processing algorithms for measurements made with cloud spectrometers operated on research aircraft, to discuss differences in the data processing methods, to assess optimum practices and to recommend a way forward in improving data quality from cloud probes.
After a welcome and introduction to the workshop by Darrel Baumgardner (Droplet Measurement Technologies), Christiane Voigt (leader of EUFAR's expert working group on In Situ Characterisation of Cloud and Precipitation Particles) presented an overview of EUFAR activities. Colin Gurganas (SPEC) showed a new study that addressed the oversizing of out-of-focus particles by the 2D-S. The session continued with a discussion of open issues related to cloud data processing. Darrel Baumgardner presented a summary of results from a questionnaire on data processing issues that had been responded to by 15 participants. The summary included current practices on data corrections for airspeed, out of focus particles, shattering and ice crystal size/habit definition. Greg McFarquhar (University of Illinois) showed a study that underscored the uncertainties in deriving particle size distributions, using the same data set from optical array probes (OAP) but processed by three separate groups. Although the same algorithms were supposed to be implemented in the processing, there were significant differences that still remained due to different criteria for accepting particles.

The next session introduced eight different software packages to process and display measurements from cloud probes. These were developed and are maintained by the University of North Dakota (David Delene), University of Manchester (Jonathan Crosier), University of Illinois (Greg McFarquhar/Wu Wei), NCAR (Aaron Bansemer), previous standards &amp;amp; protocols engineer under EUFAR 2008-2013 (Matt Freer), SPEC (Colin Gurganas) and Environment Canada (Alexei Korolev). The day ended with an introduction and a tutorial to Python by Nick Guy and Matt Freer.

A discussion on the way forward in cloud data analysis was opened on day two. This included a dialogue on definitions of microphysical cloud parameters and corrections to be applied to cloud data analysis. The urgent need for a common international reference library that includes the individual processing algorithms was agreed upon by the 43 participants in attendance. The reference database should be a living document with a quality control by referencing to existing literature or by an internal review process and an easy follow up of track changes. The possibility to assign a DOI for individual processing algorithms was emphasised. Simulated or experimentally derived data sets can serve as reference cases to test, evaluate or compare the processing algorisms. EUFAR, who currently maintains EGADS (EUFAR Airborne Data-processing Software), was recommended as a possible first choice to host such a database. In addition, an intercomparison paper on cloud data processing algorithms is planned as one outcome of the workshop. These actions will be initiated by Darrel Baumgardner, David Delene and the international cloud community possibly in connection to the EUFAR expert working group on cloud instrumentation. The progress can be followed in workshops linked to the ICARE2 international conference on aviation research hosted by EUFAR in 2017 and the AMS/ICCP conferences in 2018 and 2020.

In summary, the workshop offered a unique opportunity to bring together leading experts and young scientists to exchange information in the challenging and fast evolving field of airborne cloud measurements. The action items that were identified in this workshop and that will be carried out in the near future will be an important step forward in the interaction within and outside of the cloud physics community to improve the quality and fidelity of cloud measurements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>699DCE1E-AFDD-45CF-A5DF-7BD8A4D8529D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration between Manchester Centre for Atmospheric Science, NCAS and NCAR-USA have resulted in improved data quality control protocols for cloud microphysical data products delivered by the NERC FAAM aircraft faiclity.
