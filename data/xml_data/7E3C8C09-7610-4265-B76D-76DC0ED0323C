Our aim is to ensure that, by 2015, Warwick will be in the top 50 world Universities as measured by the quality of research output and the strength of student demand. Following a recent refresh of Vison2015 we have set out four revised objectives for our research as follows:

- Continue to search for, appoint, nurture and reward the most able academic, research and support staff

- Continue to grow PGR numbers

- Re-present our major areas of research strength around the interdisciplinary &amp;quot;grand challenges&amp;quot; currently confronting the world

- Strengthen and reposition the University of Warwick in the light of its refreshed Strategy focussing on the positive impacts on society at large.

The University welcomes the opportunity to use the unspent balance from our EPSRC research grants for a targeted and strategic programme of activities that will underpin the delivery of these key objectives of our research strategy in engineering and physical sciences. The funds from this award will be used as part of a coordinated series of investments drawing resource from EPSRC (from both this award and the Delivering Impact award), HEFCE (as part of our HEIF strategy) and the University itself (as part of our &amp;pound;500k per annum Research Development Fund).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The funding from this award will be allocated to projects and activities in the University's emerging Global Priorities Programmes (GPP) that align with the EPSRC's Delivery Plan priorities. The GPPs will bring together multidisciplinary research expertise from across Warwick's faculties to maximise the potential and impact of our research and provide a framework for dialogue with our external stakeholders from industry and commerce through the public sector to policy makers, future students and the public. EPSRC funding from this award will be coordinated with other funds from EPSRC, the University's own Research Development Fund and HEFCE HEIF in order to maximise the potential impact of this investment. Key Pathways to Impact will include:

- New Knowledge: Feasibility studies supported under this grant will be focused on emerging research opportunities that can develop new knowledge in research challenges critical to the future economic and social fabric of the UK. 

- Society: Feasibility studies and stakeholder dialogue activities underpinning GPP development will by their nature focus on key challenges facing society. The multidisciplinary approach of the GPPs will ensure that societal impact is a key consideration of all projects and activities.

- Economy: Feasibility studies will be targeted in those areas with greatest potential for collaboration and/or active participation/co-funding with end user partners. Industrial and end-user collaboration will be actively facilitated by dedicated support from business engagement officers funded through other sources.

- People: Feasibility and stakeholder dialogue activities supported through the grant will aim to maximise the participation of existing EPSRC-funded research staff in new and emerging research fields. They will also actively encourage dialogue between Warwick's research base and our many external collaborators across the GPP spectrum. Participation in cutting edge research in these fields will provide important and highly transferable skills for future employment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91816</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J014869/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBD3B7F-5022-4513-82D6-5414B965FAB3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing Machine &amp; Plant</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
