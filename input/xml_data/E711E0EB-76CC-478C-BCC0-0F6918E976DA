On the one hand, both quantity and quality of linguistic input are robustly related to language development: certain language environments are associated with earlier language acquisition, greater proficiency, and better literacy outcomes. On the other hand, children successfully acquire language in vastly varying cultural and linguistic contexts. The characterization of cross-linguistic and cross-cultural similarities and differences in child language environments, and the examination of how these differences impact child language development, have been of central interest and debate in the social sciences field of child language development for many decades. However, only in the last few years have we reached a point where we have the technological ability to examine language development in representative real-world samples, scalable to children's typical daily experiences. Through a collaboration between engineers and social scientists, ACLEW will take diverse datasets of real--world child language environments and apply cutting--edge tools to automate the quantitative analysis of key measures of child language experiences. This entails both procedural challenges (converting natural, culturally diverse experiences into meaningfully comparable data forms for both humans and automated systems to analyze) and technical challenges (adapting existing speech processing tools for use with noisy, real--world datasets). In addition to cross--disciplinary interest from researchers in psychology, cognitive science, linguistics and computer science, our findings will be of significant interest to parents, early childhood educators, and health professionals in understanding the boundaries of healthy, positive language environments for infants across cultures. Our project will provide interdisciplinary opportunities for trainees to gain expertise with state--of--the--art data curation and engineering tools. The open-source aspect of this work will expand the reach of the data and tool aggregation beyond the scope of the present project, most notably for hard--to--reach populations and sequestered datasets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are two sets of target audiences for this project's work: within-field and broader-public. 

Within the fields spanned by our research team, this work will be relevant to psychologists, cognitive scientists, speech technology engineers, and linguists. These fields approach the study of language in complementary ways; this proposal builds synergistic bridges between them. The benefit for psychologists and cognitive scientists is a set of validated tools to take better advantage of collected data. The benefit for speech technologists are robust language metric tools, vetted on realistic real-world data, with extensibility to both academia and industry. Additionally, our project also provides an ideal training ground for students and newer researchers, and the project will provide specifically orchestrated opportunities for researchers and students to gain experience in cutting edge techniques in the annotation and analysis of real-world child language samples, the development of analytic tools on naturalistic language samples, and importantly, the necessary synergistic work involved in bringing these groups together. Students and faculty alike will gain crucial experience with cross-cultural and cross-national collaboration.

Outside of our fields, our results will have important ramifications for the lay public, public policy and health professionals, especially in domains that concern families with young children: pediatrics, early education, government and private social services. Indeed, one of the critical components of the proposed work is that it goes beyond the kinds of non-representative subsamples usually studied and extrapolated from, by looking at natural behavior within home environments.

There are two main dissemination avenues, one for each target audience. 

Within the field, we will use the standard academic mechanisms for research and tool dissemination: (1) workshops and conference presentations (Cognitive Science Society, Interspeech, and the International Congress for Study of Child Language), (2) publications in high-impact and open-access journals, (3) github code repositories, including HomeBankCode (4) public-facing wikis documenting our workflow and plans (through the Open Science Framework). 

For the lay public, we will maintain a blog where we post relevant updates, articles, and opinion pieces from each group, with monthly postings during the project period and beyond. We will work with our local media relations offices in each university to promote the blog and ensure results are disseminated to the local community and wider public. 
This will include other social media avenues that are public facing as well (facebook, twitter, etc.).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R00398X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
