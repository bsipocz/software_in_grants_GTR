Understanding the geometry of symplectic and contact manifolds is thus important to understanding the dynamics of physical systems, and has applications in many diverse fields, such as optics, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics.

In the modern sense, though, the main motivation for the study of symplectic manifolds derives from their place in the study of smooth 4-manifolds, spaces which generalize the notion of space-time in which we live. Considering such a space along with a symplectic structure has been shown to allow one to define very powerful invariants of the spaces themselves. As they can be extremely complicated, these spaces are often studied by cutting into smaller, less complicated pieces, then gluing these back together. In the symplectic setting, the information contained in this construction is primarily encoded by contact structures, along which the cutting and pasting are performed. The relevant framework here is that of a &amp;quot;topological quantum field theory&amp;quot;, a set-up which has proved a hugely powerful idea in many areas of mathematics.

In the 80's and 90's though it became clear that certain contact manifolds exhibit a kind of `flexibility', making them entirely unsuited to their place in this study. This discovery, along with the classification of such structures in 3-dimensions, was one of the major important developments leading to the growth of the field of contact and symplectic topology.

The study of flexibility is very much a topological issue, lending itself to the standard tools of low-dimensional topology, in contrast to the algebraic-geometry-based setup described above. The resulting notions of `flexible' vs `rigid' phenomena have become central to the field. The research outlined in this proposal will focus on the ``gap'' between these two notions, building connections via which the machinery and techniques of each side can be brought to bear on the problems of the other. 

A first step concerns an ``algebraisation'' of flexibility. Building on previous work of the principle investigator, we aim to fully characterise the notion in the language of Floer homology, a tool closely related to the above-mentioned geometric study of 4-manifolds, and one which has proven particularly useful in the study of contact 3-manifolds. This is a multi-faceted project which involves a refinement of the so-called ``contact class'' of various flavors of Floer homology, and brings together a wide variety of tools from on the one hand the topological and combinatoric world of decompositions of 3-manifolds and on the other the more rigid and algebraic world of pseudo-holomorphic curves. This project will extend to provide tools for the algorithmic detection of flexibility, as well as defining a way of measuring rigidity.

Along with this, we will explore the relation of this framework to existing notions of `torsion', and generalizations of the framework into higher dimensions, as well as differing geometries (complex vs symplectic). We will also seek to apply the results, as well as previous work, to applications concerning classification of contact 3-manifolds, in particular finding examples of contact 3-manifolds with arbitrary ``support genus''.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary intent of the proposed research and activities is to push forward the frontiers of mathematics, generating both knowledge and additional areas of exploration. The intradisciplinary nature of the proposed research, combined with its timeliness in a rapidly growing field, both serve to ensure that this impact will be substantial. 

As with all research in pure mathematics, this impact comes via dissemination of results, and by attracting graduate students to the topic. As detailed in the Pathways to impact document, care has been taken to ensure that these are fully exploited. 

The emphasis on collaborative efforts, and the travel and time to facilitate these afforded by funding of the proposal, adds an extra dimension to the impact of the projects. This affects not only the issues of dissemination and increased interest, but also the knowledge infrastructure of our field, building strong new connections between research hubs, and allowing isolated knowledge and methods access to new opportunities. 

By its nature, the proposed projects will also have a large impact on graduate students through the opening of new areas of exploration, and potential thesis topics. The issues involved touch many areas of mathematics, allowing involvement from students with widely varying backgrounds. The wide range of institutions involved in the collaborations, as well as the timely dissemination of results, will greatly support this impact, but of course the single most important impact will come from the workshop. 

A further impact will come through the research skills acquired by the many graduate students the projects hope to involve. While of course the hope is that many of the participants in the summer workshop, and various graduate students throughout the field, continue on to careers in academia, the reality is of course that many will not (a study by the journal Science indicates in the US the number of those PhD recipients continuing in academia to be only 20% in maths and science). Mathematics is of course well known for being a ``facilitating'' subject, one which prepares students for a number of careers outside of academia. As the technology sector expands, this becomes even more relevant, to the UK economy in particular.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91118</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P004598/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
