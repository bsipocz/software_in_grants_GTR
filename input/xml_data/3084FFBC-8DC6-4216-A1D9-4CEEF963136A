It also aims to understand the implications of this shift for the normative foundations of the welfare state, especially in the work/welfare nexus.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The US and the UK have been chosen because they are at the forefront of the shift towards ?workfare?. Social assistance reforms that make benefit receipt conditional upon fulfilment of job search and work related activities are at the forefront of welfare retrenchment. This trend has accelerated in the second phase of activation reforms in the 2000s. Both countries have endorsed a contractual model of socio-economic rights. This has been evident in the reform of Incapacity Benefits and Income Support for single parents in the UK, especially in the controversail welfare reform Bill that is going through Parliament, and the reform of Food Stamps and the replacement of Aid to Families with Dependent Children by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in the US in 1996.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research project explores the socio-legal constructs that justify this rebalancing of rights and responsibilities in the US and the UK.

Leading figures from different sides of the political spectrum and the media shared their experiences of how storytelling on welfare has evolved. The debate helped launch the report 'Workfare in 21st Century Britain'. This was a very well attended event (60 people in the House of Commons Room), which sparked a passionate debate on narratives on benefit claimants in the run up to the general election. 

The panelists were:

Baroness Ruth Lister, Joint Committee on Human Rights

Polly Toynbee, Guardian

Tom Giles, BBC

Steve Baker, MP

John Redwood, MP

Dr Anne Daguerre, Middlesex University 

Claire Fox, Institute of Ideas (Chair)

This has been achieved in three main ways. 

First, I published two opinion pieces in the Guardian comment is Free in America website. The first piece, entitled Republicans wasted effort on White House welfare reform waiver, explained in an accessible language the complexities and technicalities of the ill-fated waivers initiative by the Department of Health and Human Services in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign. http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/13/republicans-wasted-effort-obama-welfare-reform. The second piece, The political calculus of President Obama 2014 budget plan, http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/10/political-calculus-president-obama-budget-plan, analysed the White House attempts at designing a budgetary compromise with House Republicans in 2014, in the context of political gridlock over the nation's budget. 

Second, on the 2nd of December 2014, I organised an event in the House of Commons to launch the report Workfare in 21st century Britain, http://workfare.org.uk/images/uploads/docs/Workfare_in_21st_century_Britain-Final.pdf. Leading figures from different sides of the political spectrum and the media - Labour's Baroness Ruth Lister, Conservative MPs Steve Baker and John Redwood, Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, 'Benefits Street' producer Richard McKerrow and BBC journalist Tom Giles - discussed the role of politicians and the media in manufacturing stereotypes of benefit claimants. The event was very well attended, with various people clearly interested in the topic and still asking several questions as the debate chair Director of the Institute of Ideas Claire Fox drew the meeting to a close. The audience comprised representatives from NGOs, practitioners, academics and students.

Finally, on the 20th of March 2015, I organised an end of project conference http://www.mdx.ac.uk/events/2015/03/assessing-20-years-of-welfare-reform-in-the-us-and-the-uk. The research showed that the erosion of social assistance rights has been a central feature of social policy reforms in both countries, a trend that has not been reversed by the Presidency of Barack Obama, with the notable exception of the Affordable Care Act, which represents the major social policy and antipoverty initiative of the administration. Videos showing the major speakers Kenneth Stephens, Legal Aid Society, New York, Vicki Lens, Columbia University, Michael Spencer, Child Poverty Action Group, Bill Davies, IIPR North, and Tony Wilson, Center for Economic and Social Inclusion, are available on the Workfare project website http://www.workfare.org.uk/ under the videos section.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>46EFA65A-027E-48F0-82DE-2AA14F1DDC59</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54622a0569d694.12244433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research examined the politics of conditional rights in social policy in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom (UK), with a specific focus on welfare reform, during the period 2010-2014. The study aimed to identify the role of ideas and elite perceptions regarding long-term unemployment, economic inactivity and poverty in the formulation of public policy. The study investigated the decision making processes surrounding reforms to two major means-tested income maintenance schemes in the United States, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). In the UK, the research investigated the introduction of new work for your benefit schemes (the Employment, Skills and Enterprise Scheme 2011) and new benefit sanctions for jobseekers under the Welfare Reform Act 2012. 

The research findings point out to contradictory results. On the one hand, bureaucratic and political elites in both countries possess a relatively sophisticated understanding of the complex links between poverty, economic inactivity and unemployment. On the other hand, despite the emergence of evidence-based policy making in the design of some programmes, political and administrative elites have continued to rely on the moral stereotyping of the undeserving poor to justify retrenchment to social assistance. In the US, the Republican-dominated Congress has ignored messages from research and pushed through retrenchment proposals that were only partially defeated by Democrats or neutralised by the Obama administration. In the UK, elites perceptions of public opinion shifts against welfare enabled relatively radical retrenchment reforms to be carried out without much political opposition. In particular, the coalition government 2010-2015 has been able to ignore critics of benefit sanctions because of the widespread support for a tough on welfare line in the general public. 

The study also investigated the evolution of welfare litigation in the US and the UK in order to assess whether there was a common doctrine emerging from litigation strategies. In the US, this involved the review of a recent decision of the Richard C. v. Berlin case in New York (November 2013) which concerned individuals who had their SNAP benefits reduced or ended following a sanction notice that did not say that a SNAP work sanction could be avoided by complying with SNAP work requirements. In the UK, the study investigated a litigation case known as Reilly and Wilson vs Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, when, in 2011, judicial review proceedings were brought by Caitlin Reilly, who took part in a workfare scheme against her wishes, and Jamieson Wilson, who refused to participate in another scheme. Like their American counterparts, British courts have been willing to strike down administrative decisions mostly in cases of procedural errors, especially when these infringed benefit claimants statutory entitlements, but have been more reluctant to take up the barrier of positive, substantive rights.

One of the main goals of the fellowship was to develop new socio-legal skills, which has been achieved. I considerably strengthened my understanding of the architecture of social security in both countries. This required an understanding of welfare litigation as evidenced by my analysis of the Reilly and Wilson vs Secretary of State in the UK and other cases in the US. I am now much better acquainted with the history of social security law in both countries. I have prepared an article for the peer review law journal Journal of Social Security Law which is currently under review. If accepted, the article would confirm that I have been able to develop a new set of socio-legal skills and adopt the writing style, standards and conventions of socio-legal academic publications. 


Important new research questions 


The study analysed some judicial review proceedings in both countries but a new important question is how litigation is being used as a tool for advocates to challenge certain provisions of welfare reform legislation, and how either governments respond or try to pre-empt potential legal challenges. For instance, in the UK advocates and legal experts are currently devising strategies to challenge benefit sanctions using Equality or Human Rights legislation in court. There is a need to monitor more closely the uses of litigation that aim to challenge either the law itself or its implementation. An analysis of this kind could be extended to European countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of the most promising avenues for taking the results forward lies in the ways in which welfare advocates and experts can use examples of successful litigation strategies in the US to challenge benefit sanctions in court. During the end of project conference, one of the most interesting sessions was the session on welfare reform litigation in both countries. Kenneth Stephens, from Legal Aid society, said that US courts and judges could be interested in examples of court decisions in the UK and that he would try to devise legal arguments/new ideas drawn from British examples. Kenneth Stephens has agreed to produce a two page summary of litigation strategies in the US, with key terms such as class action explained. Welfare advocates in the UK could similarly devise legal action tool kits for their clients. 

 Devolved governments in Wales and Scotland could also to learn from recent welfare to work strategies in the US. Some states have devised innovative strategies to help people with significant and cumulative barriers to employment move into work, with some emphasis on in work progression.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>37D71429-4DB4-4A8A-A1F2-2F716F779BAC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55bb52bcb01814.23904426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://workfare.org.uk/images/uploads/docs/Workfare_in_21st_century_Britain_Version_2.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31BC9F4E-1B7B-4B5F-983C-4C90A412632F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The new frontiers of welfare reform under the Presidency of Barack Obama</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/908caf3ee36828f0c03fcc17bbed1468"><gtr:id>908caf3ee36828f0c03fcc17bbed1468</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daguerre A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5462016160cb35.32892700</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C0F9AEF3-ED0F-46B8-AECA-5F12AE32EA40</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Unemployed and the Moral Case for Benefit Sanctions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Social Security Law</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f800a8db2a1c518ccd804ad1eba26765"><gtr:id>f800a8db2a1c518ccd804ad1eba26765</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anne Daguerre</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ea95fde143d9.40270142</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F04F4B36-FD8D-465A-9920-237C46DBA940</gtr:id><gtr:title>Welfare Reform in the UK under the Conservative-led Coalition government: ruptures and continuities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/908caf3ee36828f0c03fcc17bbed1468"><gtr:id>908caf3ee36828f0c03fcc17bbed1468</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Daguerre A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546201dd273657.39926846</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-070-27-0066</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I035951/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
