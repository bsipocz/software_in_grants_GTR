Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M019624/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We propose a feasibility study and a survey conducted at 6 sites - 2 in India, 2 in Srilanka, and 2 in Bangladesh.

1. The feasibility study will be conducted to understand the feasibility of peer-mentored interventions at the operational, research and policy levels to improve CVD health.

At the operational level, we will identify 6 worksites in Bangladesh (2), India (2) and Sri Lanka (2), obtain acceptance from the management, identify the appropriate personnel as peers to carry out interventions and identify areas at worksites to implement interventions (caf&amp;eacute;, physical exercise, stress reduction, tobacco environment).

At research level, we will choose the best methods to identify individuals at risk for interventions, measure risk factor levels identify &amp;amp; train the peer mentors, design the most appropriate interventions, determine the training goals for the peer mentors, select the training methods, and develop the intervention tools. 

At policy level, we will, in discussion with the worksite management and the concerned State Government departments (health and labour departments) determine the need, methods and outcomes of the interventions. This strategy ensures that we have useful insights on the interventions as well as the agreement and investment of key stake-holders in relevant departments

2. A qualitative study will be conducted to understand the priorities for policy level changes to improve the CVD environment at worksites in each country, at the Central and Regional levels; to understand the common barriers for an optimal CVD environment at worksites; and to understannd the most acceptable peer mentor-based interventions for employees to improve CVD health.

We will survey at least three levels of management staff per site on the CVD environment at the workplace. Specifically this will include tobacco policy, food at workplace, opportunities for physical activity, medical care if any provided at worksites, policy on chronic care for employees, bariers for optimal care and possible interventions to improve CV health. We will survey 5 management staff at each level or 15 per worksite for a total of 120 at 8 sites.

We will conduct focussed group discussions and in-depth interviews among management staff and employees to better understand policy issues, barriers for CVD care and acceptable interventions to improve CV health.

If peer mentor mediated interventions prove to be effective in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, such interventions could be scaled up globally. As adults can spend upto 60% of their time at workplaces, interventions such as these could prove to be effective in reducing cardiovascular risks and reap rich dividends by reducing cardiovascular deaths, thus helping to achieve World Hearth Federation's goal of 25 by 25.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>From analysis of the outcomes of this development grant we will (a) assess feasibility and (b) identify barriers and workable interventions for a definitive or full-scale study.

(a) Feasibility: we will analyse feasibility at three levels. 
We will establish feasibility at the operational level, when we identify 6 appropriate worksites in Bangladesh (2), India (2) and Sri Lanka (2), obtain written acceptance from the worksite management, identify the right personnel as peers to carry out interventions and identify areas at worksites to implement interventions (caf&amp;eacute;, physical exercise, stress reduction, tobacco environment). 

We will establish feasibility at the research level, by identifying the most appropriate method to (a) identify individuals at risk for interventions, (b) identify the appropriate peer mentors, (c) select the most acceptable interventions, (d) determine the training methods and goals for the peer mentors, (e) select the training methods (f) design the training and intervention tools, (g) determine risk factor levels in the worksite population design

We will establish feasibility at the policy level, when in discussion with the worksite management and the respective State Departments (Health and Labour Departments) we will determine the need, methods and outcomes of the interventions and get their buy-in into the programme. This will also ensure that we identify the right interventions and have the agreement of key stake-holders. 

(b) Identification of barriers and interventions: through a qualitative study we will determine the barriers for an optimal CVD environment at the workplace and also determine the most acceptable peer-mentored interventions for employees to improve CV health.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Presently there are no high quality studies done on comprehensive worksite interventions to impact the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases(CVD) in low and middle income countries.

Our proposed trial called PROGRESS will generate evidence on a multilevel policy and individual level interventions to reduce CVD risk at worksites. We will work closely with occupational health associates and the governments in three proposed south Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, and Srilanka). University of Oxford with expertise in these areas will work with investigators in these countries to design, conduct, analyse and disseminate the findings.

PROGRESS will develop tools for worksite interventions (diaries, public signage, training manuals, followup strategies, including periodic text messages, presentations on health promotions and efficient referral systems). The evidence generated and the experience gained in the trial will be novel and useful to adapt and help scale up such work in other worksites in the three countries as well as other countries.

Specifically we anticipate the following impact:

At the worksites:
1. Enhanced awareness among all workers on the importance of preventive care for CVD
2. This awareness will also quite likely extend to their family members
3. The worksite environment will change related to tobacco use, improved diet, increased physical activity, regular checks for BP and blood glucose. 
4. The management will consider and implement improved health policy to enhance access ( group health insurance, worksite clinics for CVD) and timely referrals.
5. Overall improved health resulting in reduced absenteeism, improved productivity and better quality of life and worker satisfaction.

For Society and countries at large
1. The tools developed , trial findings and the experience gainged can be adapted and used for other worksites and at other countries.
2. Occupational health organizations and the governements will consider implementing policy changes at worksites for better CVD health.
3. This scaling up will have significant impact on the health of the workers and their families as well as result in greater productivity in countries that depend on their workforces for economic progress</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manitoba</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>PROGRESS study collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>455BC7CD-9D57-44EF-959E-33D5F0FD6238</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The study is ongoing and hence no significant outcomes have been formally reported/ published.

At the policy level, we will, in discussion with the worksite management determine the need, methods and implementation of restricting tobacco use, increases physical activity, improving diet and enhancing access to treatments.

We would like to understand the policy level interventions in the entire worksite
a) What is the feasibility of peer-mentored interventions at the operational, research and policy levels to improve CVD health?
b) What are the priorities for policy level changes to improve the CVD environment at worksites in each country?




Given below is the update on policy level intervention at workplaces in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka.

BANGLADESH:
Meetings were held at both the worksite to discuss policy level intervention. The General Manager of the work site has agreed for display of health messages in the form of posters at the factory premises and at the Head Office. 

INDIA:
The Peer mentors had come up with 26 recommendations for policy level interventions at the work site. This was discussed with Management and shortlisted 8-10 feasible policy level interventions. The first policy level intervention was the display of health messages at workplace in the knowledge portal of their intranet which is accessed by all employees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d9f6eeb36a4.85453649</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Health Awareness Talk at the work sites in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADC67750-6249-485C-A915-C2FA2DEEB63E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Health Awareness Talk at work sites in Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka focused on create awareness among the employees at worksite regarding the Cardio Vascular Diseases and its risk factors and how to prevent its occurrence. 
3 sessions covered during the talk as: 1) Why is heart disease, stroke and diabetes increasing in our country and how can we prevent it 2) Why conduct a project to improve health at worksites , 3) What will be done as part of the PROGRESS project at the worksite, and how will it benefit the employees and followed by discussion with the employees. 

Outcome/impact: The health awareness talks were well received by the worksite audience. The session was an interactive one which generally kindled interest about evidence based preventive measures for cardiovascular disease prevention. This interest also resulted in participation in the peer mentor mentored intervention study. There has been increased demand for more health awareness sessions on chronic cardiovascular disease prevention.

Wherein 3-4 participants were assigned to each of the Peer mentors to council them on medication adherence &amp;amp; life style modification, provide mutually agreed targets to be achieved in 3 months. The participants were reviewed every month by the peer mentor to help them achieve their targets. Simple diary with questionnaire was provided to participants and peer mentors to record the details of the intervention. The management at each of the work site motivated the employees to participant in the intervention and explained to them the benefits.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B65D3EC3-5862-4364-B7AE-566E9E4B2D55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Given below is the update on the intervention at Bangladesh &amp;amp; India BANGLADESH: 1)1st work site: Intervention started in september 2016. 50 baseline &amp;amp; 50 1st month visits completed, 2nd month follow up ongoing 2) 2nd Work site: Intervention started in september 2016. 50 baseline &amp;amp; 1st month visits completed, 2nd month follow up ongoing INDIA: 1)1st work site: Intervention started in February 2016. 50 baseline visits completed. final follow up visits completed 2) 2nd Work site: Intervention started in December 2016. 11 baseline visits and 3 1st month visits completed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c64b9849ef92.08535401</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Baseline Interventions at  6 worksites in 3 countries</gtr:title><gtr:type>Preventative Intervention - Physical/Biological risk modification</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2016</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The project aims to reduce cardiovascular risk at a workplace by behavioral modification facilitated through a trained 'Peer Mentor'. The peer mentor is a person chosen from among the employees at a certain workplace, must be motivated enough to have a desire to bring about a difference in the health of their colleagues. The mentor is then trained on various aspects of heart health by a team of investigators (Physicians). The mentors then assess their colleagues' risk using a validated risk assessment tool (Framingham risk score) and then intervene, through education and systematic follow-up to try to bring about changes in their diet/physical activity levels, improve or maintain medication compliance to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

This is a pilot study and we are exploring the feasibility of running a trained peer mentored intervention to reduce CVD risk at workplaces.The UK-MRC/ Wellcome trust/ DFID is the principle source of funding for this development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0069F91C-BB86-4648-A2B7-DC667DB88056</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first set of peer mentors at one workplace in India have been trained.
