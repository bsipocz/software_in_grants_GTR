Chemotherapy and antibody treatments can be used to control CLL in many patients, but currently there is no cure. The majority of patients with CLL are between 50 and 80 years old at the time of diagnosis, but it can affect people at any age. Typically, CLL develops slowly, and it may be months or even many years before a patient develops symptoms, such as weight loss, night sweats, anaemia, enlarged lymph glands, or the development of troublesome infections. Studies have shown that there is no benefit to treating patients with CLL before they develop symptoms, and therefore some patients may not need any treatment for years. Others however, have a much more aggressive form of the disease and need intensive chemotherapy soon after diagnosis. To further complicate matters, not all patients respond equally well to the same types of treatment. Given this diversity in the nature of CLL, deciding when and how best to treat each patient is one of the major challenges in looking after patients with this type of leukaemia. 
 
A lot of work has already been done to identify differences in blood and bone marrow that can be easily measured in CLL patients to predict how quickly their leukaemia will develop and how it will respond to treatment. Nearly half of patients with CLL carry or 'express' a protein called CD38 on the surface of their CLL cells when they are diagnosed, and this is easily measured by a blood test. Patients whose CLL cells express CD38 tend to have a more aggressive form of the disease and need treatment earlier; they respond less well to treatment and tend not to live as long as patients whose CLL cells are negative for CD38. A better understanding of CD38, and what determines its expression, could therefore help doctors to understand more about how to treat this group of patients more effectively.

Dr James Allan is a Senior Lecturer at Newcastle University, and his research group have recently generated data that suggests that CD38 expression is regulated by another protein called IRF4. The purpose of this new project therefore is to work out how IRF4 affects CD38, and to determine whether this interaction might be a useful new target for treatments. It may be that the IRF4-CD38 interaction can be modified with treatment to delay or even prevent disease progression. The project will use peripheral blood samples collected from patients with CLL at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, with their consent. 

Recent research has demonstrated methods of growing CLL cells in the laboratory to mimic the lymph node and bone marrow environment that the cells experience in the body. We will use these techniques in our research, to produce results that are highly relevant to management of CLL in patients. 

Cutting edge techniques such as 'ChIP' (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and 'EMSA' (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) will be used to demonstrate that the IRF4 protein binds to a section of the gene which is responsible for making CD38. Using short strands of genetic material called RNA which can be incorporated into CLL cells in the laboratory, we will also reduce the amount of IRF4 protein in CLL cells, to see if this affects the cells' expression of CD38 and how they respond to CLL treatment. The laboratory research, analysis and publication of data will be carried out by Dr Helen Marr, a Haematology doctor, under the supervision of Dr James Allan. 

We hope that this research will help doctors to predict more accurately the course of CLL, and help them to make informed decisions on an individual patient basis. Ultimately, we hope that this research will also lead to the development of new treatments for CLL, targeting IRF4.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) follows a heterogeneous disease course and this presents a challenge in clinical management. A number of prognostic factors that can help predict disease progression and guide treatment have been identified. Of these, CD38 expression conveys a poorer prognosis with CD38+ve patients experiencing a shorter time to first treatment and reduced median survival. Understanding how CD38 drives disease pathogenesis and what regulates CD38 expression at a genetic and functional level could lead to a better understanding of its application as a prognostic marker, and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. 

A genome wide association study has identified a risk allele for CLL in the 3'UTR region of IRF4, a master regulator of B cell differentiation. IRF4 dysfunction has already been implicated in the pathogenesis of CLL, and we have demonstrated in a study of over 800 patients that this risk allele is an independent predictor of poor prognosis (HR 1.6, p&amp;lt;0.006). Vitally, we also demonstrated an association between the IRF4 risk allele and CD38 expression, with carriers of the risk allele more likely to have CD38+ve disease (p=0.004). The CD38 promoter region contains a putative binding region for IRF4, suggesting that IRF4 regulates CD38 expression. We predict that the IRF4 risk allele codes for a variant that affects IRF4 protein levels, which ultimately affects promoter binding to downstream transcriptional targets including CD38. Using ChIP and EMSA techniques, we will demonstrate and quantify this binding, and its effects on CD38 expression. We will use RNA interference techniques to investigate the effect of IRF4 knockdown on CD38 expression, and to examine the effect of IRF4 expression levels on cytotoxic sensitivity. Experiments will be conducted in an immortalised B cell line and on primary ex vivo CLL lymphocytes, co-cultured on a fibroblast system designed to mimic the in vivo tumour microenvironment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are many potential beneficiaries to my research. Ultimately, I hope to benefit CLL patients by delivering research which leads to the development of effective new treatments and improved management strategies. CLL is at the forefront of clinical research, with a major change in first line treatment in the last five years, and several new agents in phase 3 trials currently. Understanding the interaction between IRF4 and CD38 could lead to the development of targeted therapies for CLL, including strategies directed at IRF4 itself: successful inhibition of P53 and BCL6 has opened the door to the potential use of transcription factors such as IRF4 as new treatment targets. 

Importantly, an improved understanding of the molecular and genetic interaction between IRF4 and CD38 could also lead to the development of improved prognostic models for CLL. Undoubtedly, some patients with CLL struggle with the concept of being left untreated in the early stages of their disease and meaningful prognostication models are important not only for doctors in making treatment decisions, but also for patients to understand the basis of those decisions and what they might expect over their disease course. 

Through completion of my project and PhD, I also hope to benefit local Newcastle Haemato-oncology charity, Bright Red, which has funded the first year of my research. Bright Red is an extremely dynamic and productive charity, and they offer invaluable practical and financial support for patients in the region with malignant blood disorders. Through my clinical work, I have already seen at first hand the huge benefits Bright Red can bring for patients and relatives. Bright Red has an excellent fund raising profile and is actively involved with public engagement and education throughout the region. It is a new charity, and I am the first Bright Red Fellow to be funded as a Clinical Research Associate. By completing a clinically relevant PhD and achieving associated publications in high-impact journals, I hope to raise the profile of Bright Red.

In addition, I anticipate that other Haematology trainees in the Northern Deanery will benefit from my involvement in research. Unfortunately, there can be many logistical stumbling blocks to taking time out of a clinical training programme to pursue research, and the process requires motivation, initiative and commitment. I have an understanding of the practical steps needed in making this transition from clinical training to research outside of the training programme, and I can offer advice, encouragement and feedback for other registrars who hope to pursue a research project. I believe it is vital that research opportunities remain relevant and available for clinical trainees, and as the elected registrar serving on the Regional Specialty Training Committee, I can ensure that research interests are addressed and prioritised within the Deanery.

Finally, as I am committed to pursuing a career in Academic Haematology with a specialist interest in CLL, I hope to bring benefits to the CLL service in the region as a whole. Ultimately, I hope to be involved in offering an outstanding service for CLL patients through the Northern Centre for Cancer Care, exemplifying clinical and research excellence. I think it is essential to have a fulfilling and productive collaboration between clinical and research teams in order to drive forward research and offer the best possible patient management, and there is a fabulous opportunity for this to be developed in CLL in the Northern region.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K024140/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
