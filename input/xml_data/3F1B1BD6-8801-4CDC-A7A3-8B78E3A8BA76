It has two main strands reflecting historical, systematic and practical aspects of the subject. Together, these strands constitute a body of work that is cross-disciplinary, collaborative, inclusive of a younger generation of scholars and with public impact. Both represent the culmination of many years of research and academic recognition.

1. A study of the theology of providence - a book of c120K words will be produced for the Cambridge University Press Studies Current Issues in Theology Series. The idea of providence is central to the ecumenical traditions of Christianity, and has been especially prominent in the doctrine and spirituality of the Reformed churches since the time of Zwingli and Calvin. It combines the notions of divine foresight, guidance and rule in Christian thought. These have been important not only in the shaping of Christian doctrine but in their practical significance for faith communities and individual believers. Notions of providence are often displayed in attitudes to fortune, fate, uncertainty and unexpected events. Misfortune is too frequently interpreted as a form of divine retribution. This book offers a comprehensive study of providence in the Bible and the history of the church, and also its secular manifestations in approaches to economics, empire, evolution and politics. Criticism of the classical western tradition is offered - it leans too far in the direction of fatalism and total divine control - and an attempt is offered to describe an alternative approach that is more intellectually modest but also practically useful. Discussion of pastoral topics such as suffering and prayer is included. 

2. The history of Scottish theology - a co-edited three volume collection of essays is planned with Oxford University Press. This will fill a major lacuna in the study of Scottish intellectual history. Despite the significant theological work that was generated in Scotland and exported to other parts of the world, there is still no comprehensive study of Scottish theological traditions. Three volumes are projected covering a chronological sequence from the late middle ages to the 'second Reformation' around the mid-17th century (the zenith of Reformed orthodoxy in Scotland), from the early Enlightement to the mid-19th century (when German influences in philosophy, theology and Biblical criticism become apparent), and from the mid-19th and 20th centuries. An international team of scholars, including many younger researchers, will be recruited and conferences held at which first drafts of papers will be presented. The three-volume series will be co-edited by Dr Mark Elliott (St Andrews) and published by Oxford University Press. Much, though not all, of the focus will be on the different inflections of the Reformed tradition in the Scottish Presbyterian churches. Particular attention will be devoted to the popular transmission of theologies in Scotland through ballads, hymns, church architecture, catechism, sermons and liturgy. A knowledge exchange event will be held at an early stage of the project both to disseminate key research findings and to elicit wider reaction for the purpose of enriching ongoing research activity.

The combined impact of these projects will be to advance the interpretation and reception of Reformed Christianity in Scotland and beyond. The focus on cross-disciplinary perspectives and collaborative work will offer innovative and fresh approaches to the subject in a broad comparative context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary;
 Impact will be achieved in each of the two main elements of the project and also through the Futures of Theology Project in Princeton. 

1. Theology of providence
The intended audience comprises church leaders, churchgoers and those with a less-institutionalised focus on spirituality. These can be readily identified through existing links between New College and a range of ecumenical bodies, civic networks, and media contacts in Scotland.

Providentialist notions have an important pastoral and existential function, particularly though not exclusively in the Reformed tradition. The reworking of the theology of providence in a manner that seeks to avoid more overbearing accounts that were too slanted in a determinist and fatalist direction is of deep practical significance. Some impact upon wider audiences will be achieved through an ongoing strategy of i) sermons, ii) public talks, iii) a column in Life &amp;amp; Work, the monthly magazine of the Church of Scotland iv) contribution to Church of Scotland Theological Forum, the standing theological commission of which I am a member and v) occasional broadcast appearances (e.g. with Radio Scotland Sunday Morning programme).

The constructive outcomes on the project will demonstrate ways in which providentialist notions ought to have a therapeutic aspect for faith communities which is both consoling, energising and hopeful. This militates against negative constructions of suffering and misfortune as forms of divine retribution and hence as deserved. By promoting the notion of human persons as agents rather than passive recipients of providence, I stress the empowering (rather than debilitating) features of theology. 


2. History of Scottish Theology
The intended audience comprises leaders and members of the Scottish churches and those in civic Scotland with an interest in the shifting markers of national identity. Once again existing networks, e.g. through the Centre for Theology and Public Issues, will enable multiple contacts to be established.

The projected three-volume work on the history of theology in Scotland will constitute the first comprehensive treatment of the subject. As such, it is likely to be a landmark scholarly event which will prove capable of attracting media attention at the time of its launch. Impact will be maximized by working with OUP sales and marketing team, the Communications and Press Office at the University of Edinburgh, and the Press Office of the Church of Scotland. In addition, the research assistant will maintain a regular project website, hosted by the College of Humanities and Social Science in the University of Edinburgh. This will provide information and updates on the project throughout its duration. The wider relevance of the project to Scottish studies will enable publicity to be secured through other networks, e.g. School of Scottish Studies, Scottish-based newspapers, Scottish Review, and the Center for Scottish Philosophy based in Princeton. A knowledge exchange event will be organized to raise awareness of their traditions amongst the churches of Scotland. This will profile highlights of the research and will be undertaken at a mid-point in the enquiry in order to elicit feedback from a wider audience with the potential to influence subsequent research.

In addition, the Futures of Theology project sponsored by the Center of Theological Inquiry in Princeton is likely to have an impact on the development of syllabi in educational institutions throughout the world. This will be achieved mainly by the dissemination of research findings through the CTI website and other networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186485</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference on Scottish theology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6481F68B-6B7D-4D33-8A50-EBC4CBC008F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 60 clergy, church members, and students attended several presentations on the theology of the cross in Scottish theology.
