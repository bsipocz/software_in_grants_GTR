It has the potential to revolutionise healthcare. RM has been named by the Government as one of the priority technologies for UK competitiveness. The market has a global value estimated to grow to $20.0B by 2025. This Fellowship will enable a five-year programme of manufacturing research to be conducted using industrial practice and experience. The aim is to accelerate the commercialisation of RM.

The work will focus initially on methods that can be used to increase the speed of growth of cell and tissue products and that will provide the means for more effective control of production than is currently possible. The aim is to open up the commercialisation of RM to different modes of production than are currently possible, enabling entrepreneurs to choose business models that fit the type of product and the way it must be delivered to clinic. This will involve working on example systems that have the same characteristics as particular types of RM product and measuring the response of the growing cells or tissue to systematic changes in the feeding regime and the physical environment. The results will be simplified to provide robust, controllable growth instructions that can be built into self-contained, automated units for reliable manufacturing even with non-specialised staff working in non-factory settings.

The programme will be pre-competitive, that is, it will concentrate on the common features of RM manufacture and will aim to provide generic solutions that can be tailored for specific products. Researchers will acquire a commercial outlook and will become fluent in the regulatory and economic aspects of RM manufacture. This meets EPSRC's ambition to create leaders who will deliver engineering excellence and real-world outcomes. 

The work will take place at Loughborough University where the Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in RM and the EPSRC Doctoral Training Centre in RM comprise an ideal setting. The School sets the pace of UK innovation in engineering-driven methods to commercialise RM. 
The Fellowship will enable Nick Medcalf, an industrial engineer with experience leading collaborative research in cell- and tissue-based therapeutics, to move into academia and to influence the direction and practices of RM research at Loughborough University and beyond.
By the end of year five the Fellowship will have:

1. Created a thriving network of pre-competitive research collaborators from industry who are seeking and sharing practical methods for rapid RM commercialisation
2. Delivered 'demonstrator' projects based upon selected clinical indications
3. Created new production tools (reactors and control systems) that are practical and pragmatic, flexible yet robust
4. Identified novel modes of manufacture that are accessible to new RM business with modest outlay in capital and labour.
5. Built a team that works to a shared vision of systematisation of research. This method of working will make the team immediately recognisable to industry as one that speaks their language. It is hoped that the team will become, in time, the team of choice for entrepreneurs who need pragmatic engineering support for RM manufacture
In the longer term the Fellowship will enable the Fellow to achieve a personal ambition to change the way that the innovation pipeline in RM is managed in terms of the manufacturing research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Fellowship will benefit six categories of stakeholder:

1. Academics working in regenerative medicine will benefit via: ability to relate their work to the growing knowledge base and to place their activity in a framework using a common language of defined unit operations. A community of learning will be established oriented towards the industrial challenges and led with pragmatism. The focus on pre-competitive work will encourage sharing of best practice. The intention is to nurture researcher-entrepreneurs who will plan and execute work based upon objective risk criteria for business and not simply on the quest for more understanding. 
2. Commercial organisations will benefit from an increasing ease of adoption of innovations in regenerative medicine. There will be a progressive trend towards a whole-process outlook among researchers when making a pitch to investors or big business to adopt innovations. Both new and established enterprises will benefit. Established enterprises will benefit from the creation of a body of pre-competitive learning which can be added to in an incremental way. New enterprises will find the research platform an easier point of entry into the manufacturing issues. 
3. Clinics will benefit through access to more cost-effective treatments based upon regenerative medicine solutions. The cost-effectiveness will result partly from improved manufacture (less waste, more control) and partly from improved delivery resulting in improved scheduling.

4. Patients will benefit from increasingly remedial treatments rather than conservative care only. As regenerative solutions become more readily available they will be more likely to be adopted as a first-line treatment.

5. The University of Loughborough will benefit from its increasing impact at the centre of a global community of pragmatic, challenge-led research with a distinctive commercial culture.

6. The United Kingdom will benefit from the competitive lead that will accrue from being first-in-market with new modes of operation and production that meet regulatory standards. Direct benefit to the UK economy will be through increased competitiveness and international leadership in research. Indirect benefit will be consolidating the country at the centre of this culture of integrated manufacturing research making a barrier to entry for overseas business and attracting foreign businesses to establish bases here.

Impact will be enhanced through collaboration and co-production opportunities. These will take the following forms.
A. Co-production opportunities with professional societies (the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institution of Chemical Engineering, the British Association of Research Quality Assurance) based around 'sandpit' events and mentoring start-up businesses
B. Oral presentation at conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals and trade magazines
C. Table-top presence at relevant trade events 
D. Value promotion to clinical centres by direct contact and working with key opinion leaders in clinical practice to ensure a) that relevant constraints and opportunities are built into the work and b) that these same leaders can eventually act as champions for the uptake of findings from the work
It is essential for maximum impact that the Fellowship adds to, and does not detract from, the other main initiatives. Early meetings will be sought with the management of the following organisations to ensure complementary work plans.
-The Cell Therapies Catapult
-UCL Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine
-MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine
This will be reviewed at least annually.

The work will be directed with milestones. Some of these that follow are additional to those described in the Fellowship Plan sheet.
Six months Dialogue established with named contact in regulatory authority - US and UK
Three years Workshop delivered via professional society
Four years Publication strategy executed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>887758</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>3Dynamics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:description>EP/M017656/1 A feasibility study of mass customisation governance: regulation, liability, and intellectual property of re-distributed manufacturing in 3D printing</gtr:description><gtr:id>3438E2B4-0490-4BCF-B7FE-1D55EAB52341</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project was multidisciplinary comprising law, regulatory affairs, sociology and technical aspects.

The Narrative Impact from the Fellowship to date should be considered in the light of two other initiatives from the EPSRC. These are a) the EPSRC Re-distributed Manufacturing in Healthcare Network ('RiHN', commenced in 2015) and b) the Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative Medicine at Loughborough University (concluded in February 2016). The Network (in which the Fellow initiated and drove the initiative by which the Network was set up and awarded as a result of the submission by the PI, Dr Wendy Phillips, of UWE, has since become a major vehicle for progressing the systems engineering aspect of the Fellowship. This indirect (i.e. non-PI) approach was adopted in response to discussion with Dr Mark Claydon-Smith of the EPSRC-ESRC panel that set up the award call. The Fellow and Dr Claydon-Smith agreed that it would be appropriate for a fresh PI to be recruited to make a bid for the Network with the assistance of the Fellow. This approach was in recognition that the Fellow had recently (2014) been appointed Director of the Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative Medicine and that this commitment would not permit him adequately to address the Network if he were the PI. The Fellow has remained a leading contributor to the Network since its award and has been intimately connected with the arrangement of the workshops, feasibility studies and public events. The aspects of the network that will relate to impact in industrial and societal terms are those that arise from the feasibility studies and from the thematic workshops in 2015-16. Meanwhile the CIM has occupied the main part of the Fellow's contribution to the sector and the outputs from the CIM are reported more fully under the Narrative Impact for that grant (EP/H028277/1). The market research that was conducted in order to make two bids (2014-15) by the Fellow for EPSRC Future Manufacturing hubs has provided clear directions for future research and has built important relationships with industrial (GSK, LGC, the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult) and academic (universities of Birmingham, Keele, Newcastle, Nottingham, UCL and York). These thematic directions concentrate around the subject of control, systems engineering and improved methods for ensuring reproducibility of processes, site-to-site and between teams. Some of this work is now being developed in the UKRMP project. The remainder will be re-examined by the Fellow and used to form the basis of single-theme applications for funding with co-production from industry collaborators. The Fellow has adopted an important position in emerging international standards and guidance via BSi. He has a leading role in the regenerative medicine work of ISO Technical Committee 276 (Bioprocessing), working alongside BSi and LGC. In November 2015 the Fellow organised a workshop held at Loughborough at the request of the Japanese delegation and convener (Heki, Tatsuo of FIRM) to examine the topic of 'manufacturability' i.e. that property of well-designed cell processes that can provide out-scalable manufacture. The Fellow is leading this activity which will result in a white Paper in 2016 co-produced by the Japanese, US, UK and South Korean delegates. A strategically-important spin-off study from the Fellowship in the regulatory/systems area has been the study of the implementation of 'Optimed-ID', an automated medicines dispensing platform at Leicester General Hospital. The system is being assessed for its impact on medicines costs across the four renal wards by removing losses in-system and improving ordering precision. The Fellow has reported on the system to the committee chaired by Lord Carter of Coles and also to the Department of Health. The work is expected to generate opportunities for integrating fresh-preserved medicines in this rapid and fully-traceable supply chain system.

Additional report entered for 2016:

The work on the EPSRC Re-distributed Manufacturing in Healthcare network has led to project opportunities being identified from military medicine (woundcare project) and operational research (Collaborative Enterprises). These are being worked up into fundable value propositions. The support of the Researcher has been sought out by regional enterprise (Future Health Technologies and Nu-Vision) for assistance with business development.

Work with the Royal Academy of Engineering has resulted in an invitation to take part in a knowledge exchange delegation in April 2017 to Shanghai where the Researcher will represent innovative healthcare manufacturing for possible Anglo-Chinese collaborative development.

Research on Bioartificial Liver support systems with the company Asymptote during 2016 has shown the fundamental challenge with such systems to be a dichotomy between the need for a cell strain that is both metabolically active and that is capable of expansion to commercially-meaningful levels. A change in direction of this Innovate UK-funded project will determine in 2017 whether this gap can be bridged using genetic manipulation. Other products in this area have not addressed the challenge.
The Researcher has taken the operation that was the hub of the Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative Medicine (the Centre for Biological Engineering) and is taking steps to change the management structure so that it is self-supporting in the future as an 'Academic Business Unit'. It is hoped that this change will be an innovation in operating style for Loughborough University that may be reportable in its own right in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F66DE609-070F-4818-948C-6099B3404AFC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56db072fe4fd72.30806312</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The work is still ongoing; this is an interim report.
