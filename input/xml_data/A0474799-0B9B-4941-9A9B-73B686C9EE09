for a Sustainable and Healthy Digital Economy</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M022722/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The CHERISH-DE Centre at Swansea University is predicated on an extensive understanding of the human context and condition alongside the potential and limitations of digital technologies. It draws on - and unfolds - the broad experience and talent available to it, in its multidisciplinary researchers, to weave new socio-technical materials that will provide effective, comforting and pleasing fabrics to support future living. We combine researchers (both in the Centre and in our partners) from social science, computer science, economics, medicine, arts and humanities and law.

Over the past decade, the Swansea team has developed a unique focus on multi-disciplinary work within challenging human environments. Specifically, we have collaborated with a broad range of stakeholders to understand and address fundamental challenges connected with health and social care; resource constrained communities; and, safety and security.This perspective has built a platform of enabling concepts, technologies, policies and approaches ready to facilitate next stage digital economy innovations and the people skills required. The CHERISH Centre will use the notion of an extreme and challenging human environment as the fulcrum to drive understandings of how future products and services can evolve to fit and extend the human condition.

By focussing on a person's lived experience in relation to the three challenging human environments and contexts (C1-C3), we will maximise the likelihood that digital innovations address real human needs and values and hence lead to effective products and services. Each interconnected context theme will be led by investigators from a mix of disciplines.

*C1 Health and social care (e.g., medical devices, e-health, health informatics, patient services); 
*C2 Resource Constrained Communities (e.g., novel devices and services to access technology for social development and economic regeneration); 
*C3 Safety and Security (e.g., cyberterrorism, cybersecurity, 'dark web').

Using the lens of a challenging human environment, the CHERISH-DE Centre will provide concrete, diverse impacts, stimulating and supporting digital innovation by: 

*producing compelling case-studies, proofs-of-concepts and toolkits to platform future product, policy and service development that will enrich the social, economic and cultural life of UK citizens.

*creating and equipping a cadre of next generation Digital Economy (DE) researchers. The Centre will begin life with a dedicated core of experienced multidisciplinary research leaders, along with Early Career Researchers (ECRs) who have already been developed through the distinctive DE style of working. This team will draw in, train and innovate with strong discipline researchers across the host institution and partners in the UK - including the other DE Centres and related activities - and internationally. This growing team will not only be able to do DE-type work in private and public sector organisations but, critically, will be a credible and powerful advocate for the approach's methods and motivations. 

The Centre has been shaped and will evolve through the support and intense engagement with key private, public and third sector stakeholders including the BBC, DVLA, Microsoft, IBM and, critically for the economy, a broad and deep network of Small to Medium Enterprises</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The CHERISH-DE Centre has impact at its heart. The Case for Support and the rest of the proposal detail the broad and diverse real and enduring impacts the Centre will foster - e.g., a portfolio of medical and social care demonstrators to stimulate new ways of working in hospitals and care contexts, sustaining and enhancing life; a framework to assist in the social and economic regeneration of a significant urban context, stimulating other City Regions in the UK to combine digital and physical interventions for truly involving local communities in the future development of their neighbourhoods; and, toolkits that enable the previously intractable formal proof led methods of computer science to be deployed by non-experts in critical safety and security domains.

In addition to providing a scaffold for significant new technologies, tools, policies and approaches that speak to the three challenge contexts, the Centre will pioneer cross challenge interactions. This approach will demonstrate the value of disrupting well established solutions in each area by applying impact-led thinking from others. For example, the multi-faceted approach to social care provision in the community can be applied to security contexts. So, the use of multiple agencies and supports to provide robust, integrated care to the vulnerable suggests a framework for digital and cyber security that is distinct from the single-point, highly engineered approaches in some conventional approaches.

Throughout the duration of the project, the Centre management team and all that engage it is endeavour will be focussed on this question: What measurable change is the work making to our society and economy? We will establish, and evolve, a series of measures of impact with our partners and others who join our activity to monitor and steer the work so that high-impact activities are prioritised. These measures will include:

A) Products and services stimulated by the work. The toolkits and frameworks we produce through open innovation are catalysts for private and public sector organisations. We will track both quantitatively and qualitatively the use of these resources. Our ambition is high: in pilot approaches that are built into the Centre we saw a six fold impact multiplier from each &amp;pound;1 invested.

B) People developed and enabled. Our aim is to provide a vastly enhanced human DE infrastructure to the UK. We will monitor this through personal development reviews; career tracking; and surveys of our partners and others to ensure that the people we are fostering can flourish and fit within the private, public and research sectors they will lead in the future. 

C) Policies and approaches impacted. Impact in this arena does not happen - often - by chance or diffusion. The Centre has strong partners and a core agenda that is attractive to policy makers; and, an experienced team that has engaged actively with such stakeholders in the past. From the inception of the Centre we will gather evidence that the work is impacting civic operations and the wider public through monitoring policy statements, press reporting and local and national and international government actions and changes related to our work. 

In addition to the &amp;pound;3M+ already leveraged from research users, we will assess the Centre's impact success against these measures as follows: 100 ECRs trained (nationally) through the Digital Economy Crucible; 75 international Fellowships (50 outward, 25 inward); 100 secondments with research users; 10 open innovation stakeholder-Centre spin out companies; 50 impact-driving proof of concept, toolkit and framework projects; and, &amp;pound;3 million additional income generated from interdisciplinary collaborations to sustain the Centre beyond the core funding. These figures are based on our wide experience of user engagement in large-scale University projects funded by RCUK and the EU.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3091610</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>26M Alka Hingorani and Sanket Chandan Pethkar, Industrial design centre, Indian institute of technology, mumbai</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C8ED781-BFB7-48B3-B76A-E449B8554253</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Future visits to Alka, Mumbain, India.

successful business at the Grade II listed Powerhouse building, and part of the Grade II listed Rolling Mill on
the internationally significant Hafod-Morfa Copperworks site in Swansea. This expansion of Penderyn on a
99-year lease will provide a sustainable core to act as the catalyst to unlock further regeneration of a site that
was the crucible of the world copper industry in the 1800s. Using copper distillery equipment will connect a
new manufacturing process with the vibrant past of the site. New interpretation and an integrated visitor centre
will link the commercial operation with the rich copper history of the site, and act as a focus for the memories

She also met Susan Coghlan from the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, to brief her on the HPCWales 2 project and HPC academy. They explored how Susan and her group could become involved in activities regarding HOPC and Data Science in Wales. Rita also liaised with Patricia Crossno, Sandia National Laboratories and Yong Chen, Texas Tech University, to discuss Supercomputing, HPC, and Data Visualisation. Patricia and Yong are heavily involved with the Supercomputing community, and reported how the Data Visualization section at SC16 Conference had a 46-50% increase this year - demonstrating the growing interest in Visual Analytics (and not just Scientific Visualization). 
The trip allowed Rita to develop a number of strong contacts. Being able to meet in person transformed the level of her working relationships.

Anthony's secondment centred around three interlinked goals. Namely, to: 
1. Scope out research and policy work concerning 'sexting' by young people. This was achieved through the sharing of work between the host agency and the University, and through engagement with managers within the NSPCC and key, officers in partner. 

2. Identify collaborative research opportunities. This was met through constructive discussion between the University and NSPCC, and the subsequent involvement of partner agencies in these discussions. A plan for a three tiered approach to operationalizing research in this area of activity was agreed from the development stage, piloting and through to pan-Wales research 

3. Explore the possible nature and function of e-based solutions to advise and support young people who are affected by 'sexting'. This was realised through continuing collaboration concerning how a 'package' could be created, engaging young people as partners for change and as research leaders, to further research the pressures faced online by young people.

In the short term, a potential for collaboration between Swansea University and NUMs was identified in relation to a forthcoming PhD that focuses on male sex work. 
A series of mid-term potential projects were also identified. There is a possibility of piloting a mobile app for sex workers - developed by NUMs - in Swansea with an aim to seek funding from ESPRC or CHERISH Impact, along with a potential for a collaborative participatory PhD with NUMs, Swansea University and the Open Lab Newcastle University. Based on the secondment activities, Alex Feis-Bryce will be presenting at the Responding to Sex Work Conference in February 2017.

Initially, David had received an invitation to a single Fringe event on the role of former extremists in CVE, but he was able to network in the morning and attend a full day of high-level meetings and events. This provided an opportunity to network with policymakers, practitioners and researchers, which in turn afforded him some superb openings for the rest of his visit. From UNGA, he was invited to the State Department in Washington DC to discuss his research with members of the Global Engagement Center. During this period, he networked with policymakers and researchers at a guest lecture by Professor Seib and went onto discuss in a closed door environment. The rest of his time in NYC was spent meeting with researchers and academics based in the city.
Following visit David has entered Swansea University into the Peer to Peer Global University Challenging Extremism Project - a State Department funded competition that empowers students to create, manage and disseminate their own digital marketing campaign designed at challenging local and global extremism. 
? Extremely Together - Kofi Annan Foundation. Following a conversation with one of the project coordinators, David is exploring the possibility of consulting for this project as an expert on terrorist use of social media
?
