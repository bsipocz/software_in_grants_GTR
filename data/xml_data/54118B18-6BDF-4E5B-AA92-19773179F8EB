The study forms part of the International Self-Report Delinquency Study, covering some 25 to 30 countries, mainly in Europe but also from other continents. Four of the five applicants are members of ISRD's Central Coordinating Team (CCT). The study's overall aims are to chart variations in self-reported offending and experience of crime as victims, to test the relative value of different theoretical perspectives for explaining these variations, to develop and test more integrated theories of youth offending and to draw out the implications for youth justice policy in the five countries. In order to do this, surveys of school-children will be mounted in a sample of cities across the five countries The study will contribute to the development of an integrated theory of youth offending, and will trace the implications of this for youth justice policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this study? The study is designed to have an impact on politicians, officials, strategists and practitioners.

How will they benefit from this study? There are two ways in which the study will be of value to this audience, and help them devise better crime control policies. 

1. First, it will provide them with a comparative theoretical perspective within which to think about youth crime. 
2. Secondly it will help them understand the detailed contours of youth crime, cross-country variation in youth crime, and variations in responses to it in different countries. 


The team has considerable experience and success in reaching policy audiences, measured against citations in policy documents, and our networks reach quite deeply into government departments, and associated organisations such as inspectorates. Some of the applicants also have good links with the European Commission. We are confident that we can package material from the project in ways that are accessible to policy, and that we can 'market' this material effectively at national level in each of the five countries.

We have budgeted in our proposal both for the preparation of (web-based) policy documents and for participation in policy and practitioner conferences and seminars in each country, and for dissemination to supra-national institutions such as the EU Home and Justice directorates. 

The project will have a broader social impact by potentially improving youth policies which will better the well-being of teenagers in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118847</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Hamburg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UPYC under the Open Research Area Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F696D86-AC61-4AA2-8493-C5901ACE530A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The key outputs are still being written: A Springer in Brief volume covering emerging findings from the first 27 countries to finalise their data, and a further Springer edited volume presenting UPYC findings on the 5 participating countries.

The collaboration is ongoing, although the ORA grant has now finished.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The UPYC team (Birkbeck/Edinburgh, Northeastern Uni, Uni of Hamburg, Uni of Grenoble-Alpes, Verwey Jonker Institute) are core members of the wider collaboration producing the third International Self-Report Delinquency Study, working with another 30 institutions across the world. Four of the five PIs are members of the ISRD steering group. The ORA grant has enabled each of us to deliver our country-level contributions to ISRD3, and as a by-product enabled us to steer the larger project towards a successful conclusion. 

Our contribution has ensured that ISRD3 will become a significant source of international data that will allow theory testing across a range of theoretical perspectives, whilst yielding significant findings about young people's experiences of, and attitudes towards crime and its control.

A significant subset of findings relates to differences between respondents with a migration background and others, which promises to shed light on processes of social integration and social cohesion. The Birkbeck/Edinburgh team are contributing to an edited volume on this topic, with contributions from the other UPYC partners. The book is being edited by Professors Hough (at Birkeck) and Roche (at \uni of Grenoble).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings for England and Scotland have been sent to participating schools, and findings on children's experience of, and views on, stop and search have been submitted to the Scottish Government as part of a consultation process on the topic.

But some key findings are emerging with particular relevance for the UK:

1. the hypothesised relationships between the quality of police treatment of schoolchildren, their trust in the police and their perceptions of police legitimacy have been found.

2. the much greater use of stop-and-search tactics in Scotland than in England was reflected in the data, and this greater use appears to depress children's trust in the police and erode beliefs in police legitimacy. 

More extensive findings will be submitted later in the year.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are optimistic that other researchers will want to carry out secondary analysis on the ISRD3 database which includes the UPYC one, and that more specifically they will focus on the UPYC data.
