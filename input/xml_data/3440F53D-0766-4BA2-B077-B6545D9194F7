Ask the question &amp;quot;What are the possible ways you could face while standing there?'' One answer is from zero degrees to 360 degrees, but that is not a fully-satisfying answer. The most intuitive answer is you can turn around in a circle. This answer is an example of a geometric classification of possible solutions, or a moduli space. Moduli spaces are ubiquitous in geometry. From conic sections to the range of motion of a robot, one is studying moduli spaces. In algebraic geometry, we study the geometry of the solutions of polynomials and associated geometric classification problems. When one has many variables and uses higher degrees, such questions become difficult. Such shapes formed by Typically there are three ways to study varieties: looking at other objects that sit inside them, finding ways that they sit inside other objects, and finding invariants that help classify them.

In the last 25 years, string theory has giving intuitive frameworks for studying certain classical algebro-geometric objects, Calabi-Yau shapes. In string theory, Calabi-Yau shapes are added to the space-time continuum in order to get physical models for the universe. In mathematics, this led to a geometric duality called mirror symmetry which focuses on the duality between Type IIA and IIB string theory. This rich framework allows many connections between mathematical fields, typically symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry.

Many of the connections made have to do with enumerative geometry, studying how many curves of a certain type sit inside higher dimensional objects. Mirror symmetry turned this problem in symplectic geometry into an algebro-geometric problem, making it easier to compute the answer. Some of the connections sit in number theory. Varieties have number-theoretic analogues where one can study them over a finite field, providing geometric analogues to the Riemann zeta function. 

The proposed research plan focuses on finding bridges amongst fields motivated by mirror symmetry. The proposal involves the following projects:
1.) Providing a method to compute the FJRW-invariants in symplectic geometry by linking the invariants to an algebro-geometric setting then using tropical geometry. These invariants describe how many curves of a certain type sit in a generalized version of a Calabi-Yau shape, called a Landau-Ginzburg model.
2.) Studying the number theoretic properties of Calabi-Yau shapes when viewed under mirror symmetry, harnessing properties of the zeta function associated to these shapes.
3.) Classify a certain class of higher-dimensional analogues to polygons by using their correspondence to algebraic objects by using geometric quotients, consequently giving a classification of certain types of Calabi-Yau shapes.
4.) Codify what mirror symmetry means for another type of string theory, heterotic mirror symmetry.

The work presented here will provide more links amongst mathematical fields, creating a more cohesive mathematical community. Each project takes two fields and connects them in a way so that both fields can contribute to the understanding of Calabi-Yau shapes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My proposed research will most immediately have an impact on the academic research community, like most research in pure mathematics. That being said, there are many potential long-term applications as the fields being researched have had precedents in being useful in industry and national security. For example, arithmetic geometry and number theory related to Calabi-Yau varieties have been used in cryptography. String theory may bring a grand unified theory of the universe. Tropical methods has helped in mathematical biology and economics. Toric geometry has implications in polytope theory which is used in optimization. More details on these instances are found in the Pathways to Impact statement.

The project has clear directives to disseminate the research and to optimize the possibility that such applications and real-life impact occurs. By giving talks in interdisciplinary conferences both in the UK and elsewhere and by writing more accessible papers, I will achieve a larger readership and a possibility of new real-life consequences. As these projects are intradisciplinary, there tends to be a language shift amongst the disciplines in how they study mathematics and their definitions. I will take extra care in making any article based on this work accessible for all relevant parties alike, fostering a more contiguous mathematical literature.

Work will also be undertaken to foster the next generation of British mathematics through teaching a Part III course on mirror symmetry with an eye towards the style of mirror symmetry done in the UK. Mirror symmetry is a rapidly growing mathematical discipline in which the United Kingdom has positioned itself strategically to be a leader. By teaching the new generation the field, we prepare the next generation of UK mathematicians to continue to lead the world in the field. Also, I will supervise possible research experiences for undergraduates that relate to the combinatorial elements of mirror symmetry to create more independent researchers at the undergraduate level.

As the work in this project can be combinatorial in nature, any effective algorithm to compute valuable invariants that is found will be programmed into Sage and sent to become a Sage package, openly accessible to all interested parties.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>222670</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research in Pairs - Scheme 4</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>41511</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FF2E934B-5556-4D91-B03D-C7B20EB3316B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8795ed4fc39.22300378</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Last year, we reported that project 1 is in its nascence, but promising. We have found an interesting development in the study of how one integrates one integrates to find FJRW invariants that may allow for a way to apply the Gross-Siebert program to quantum singularity theory. In particular, these integrals (which relate to a IIB string theory) should relate to not just quantum singularity theory, but open quantum singularity theory. This development, joint with M. Gross (Cambridge) and R. Tessler (ETH-Zurich), has been a great breakthrough for this field and has the promise of creating a scattering diagram, a key technical tool for studying mirror symmetry and enumerative geometry in classical Calabi-Yau geometry. We are hoping that this will give us new insight for Landau-Ginzburg models and their mirror symmetry.

With regards to project 2, my collaborators and I have found that Arithmetic Mirror Symmetry holds for certain Symmetric Quartic pencils and can find how the motivic viewpoint of periods relates to the point counts on these examples as well as the factors in their zeta functions. This paper is currently being revised for submission. Moreover, we found a more general story: we can realize via string theory that certain polynomials and deformations of polynomials share certain arithmetic properties with regards to solutions of their equations. We can prove this in a preliminary case and it works in any dimension with some technical assumptions. This is currently submitted to a journal and accessible here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09249. I am now hoping to study this motivically, linking cleanly to the conjectures outlined in the field. A new joint project with Matt Ballard probes whether a more abstract viewpoint using variations of GIT will give a cleaner picture which will add evidence that number theoretic invariants like the congruent zeta function or the Chow motive, are invariants on the choice of a IIB type string theory. 

With regards to project 3, methods were found for using the categorization of certain polytopes to effectively classify and categorize all K3 surfaces in toric varieties up to birational and derived equivalence; however, going the other way is difficult. In 2015, I reported the good news that there is an even more interesting viewpoint in the horizon of linking the geometry of objects of differing dimension via derived categories by using polyhedra instead of polytopes. This has been developed and is now on the arxiv. It led to a very general framework that does not need the polyhedral perspective, but is much more easily computed in this context. This work is openly available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04918. 

Project four has found new obstructions in the types of deformations studied in the viewpoint of deforming a heterotic string model, which in itself is interesting, but alas adds more risk to the project and more obstructions in the sense of finding a conclusive result. This novel development was found by speaking with string theory colleagues in Oxford on an EPSRC-funded visit. We have started to look at whether we can find a nice case using some easier mirror constructions, but there is nothing to reported yet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I will focus on the projects that have papers that are freely available to others at this moment. 

Project 2 leads to a new method to study the number theory of Calabi-Yau varieties, a generalization of elliptic curves. The work involves many useful tools in number theory, including hypergeometric motives and Dwork cohomology. We bring a physical intuition to the field, hoping to unify number theory and string theory.

Project 3 can be used to study the derived categories of any complete intersection. It can be used as evidence on whether or not a variety looks like (is birational to) projective space, using Kuznetsov's conjecture for cubic fourfolds as inspiration. We also hope to connect one day with the FanoSearch program, finding an intrinsic understanding of the semi-orthogonal decompositions of the derived categories of all Fano manifolds.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A6AFADBA-7496-4BB3-94B1-6FDFB9397068</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d87743586626.99987194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9F810FF-6D81-43A4-B9D8-732D0B7E6479</gtr:id><gtr:title>PROOF OF A CONJECTURE OF BATYREV AND NILL</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3a86cc968e05eb7d2cdaa9415b6ff0a3"><gtr:id>3a86cc968e05eb7d2cdaa9415b6ff0a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Favero David</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9327</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a351bdecf4a06.58783915</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N004922/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>85</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
