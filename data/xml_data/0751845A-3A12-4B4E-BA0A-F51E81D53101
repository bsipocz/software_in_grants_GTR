However, their current extent and form, including their flora and fauna, are largely derived from their role as grouse moors within extensive shooting estates that became dominant in the nineteenth century. \n\nToday 90% of grouse moors fall within a National Park, AONB or carry some form of conservation designation: 66% of grouse moors are protected as SSSI. Much of the research directed at moorlands is concerned with the conservation and management of the ecosystems and habitats, particularly since the acidic peat soils have been shown to play an important role as carbon sinks. The landscape management and wildlife conservation issues affecting these upland landscapes are considerable and have been exacerbated by recent climatic changes. Moorlands are also a major element in the recent development of open access schemes. As such, moorland conservation is a key area of landscape management in the UK.\n\nLittle research has been conducted into the recent history and archaeology of moorlands as cultural landscapes. A number of surveys recording prehistoric archaeology and the remains of industrial exploitation have been undertaken, but our understanding of moorlands as exclusive game landscapes is extremely limited. Initial studies have indicated the importance of the archaeology and landscapes associated with moorland shooting estates (Done and Muir 2001) but this has not been extended into a landscape analysis. This project is the first systematic attempt to record, interpret and present the archaeology of the modern moors, focusing on their management and use as landscapes for the elite pursuit of shooting. It will record the archaeology associated with shooting estates, such as butts, lodges, huts, stables, walls, boundary markers, as well as the impact their management for game had on landscape character. It will explore the social and economic dynamics of transition to and from exclusive shooting estates. As such it will make a major contribution to understanding about a crucial phase in the evolution of the heather moorlands, which in turn will inform current managment strategies and increase public awareness of the landscape resource. \n\nAims and objectives:\nThe project aims to understand and contextualise the archaeology associated with the exploitation of heather moorland as a habitat for game in the modern period and to assess its archaeological and environmental legacy to inform future interpretation and management. \n\nThe project will record archaeological features associated with shooting estates; it will use, inter alia, historic maps, estate archives, game records, and environmental data to ascertain the impact of shooting estates upon the historic landscape character of the moors, including their historical ecology, since the beginning of the nineteenth century. It will also explore the impact of the estates and their decline on local communities and their economies. \n\nPotential applications and benefits: The research will: \n1)be used by the AONB when putting together Higher Level Stewardship Schemes, to inform future strategies relating to the management of these unique landscapes.\n2)create a comprehensive record and mapping of related archaeological features to enable an assessment of the archaeological resource, informing management decisions. \n3)be used to inform the development of an education and interpretation application to HLF, based on community involvement in conservation. \n4)inform the management plan.\n5)be used to raise public awareness of historic landscape character and significance through public lectures, guided walks, web-resources, and leaflets on the archaeology of shooting estates. \n\nDone &amp;amp; Mui</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries: Policy Makers: Upland peat reserves are exciting intense interest due to their capacity to store/sequester carbon. Major investment is already underway or is planned to ensure that their climate change mitigation potential is exploited to the full. The outcomes of this research will help to ensure these schemes take account of the archaeological value of these landscapes by its incorporation into ANOB advice.\nAONB. Heritage assets and the historic environment are of importance to the special qualities of the landscape that underpin designation of the AONB. This is reflected in the AONB 's 2009-14 statutory Management Plan and 2009-14 Heritage Strategy. Research into the history and evolution of shooting landscapes is a specific proposal in the Heritage Strategy, and this provides the policy context for the project. The purpose of AONB designation is the conservation of natural beauty, a term that includes cultural features. The AONB provides many of the resources and knowledge about the moorland landscape, and facilitates access to the landscape of the estates which make up the AONB. It is also the main agency responsible for coordinating the management of the landscape, providing experience and expertise about the landscape, its archaeology, fauna and flora, and current management. The research will therefore feed directly into the management and heritage strategies for the area; influence their revision; and determine relevant actions. Improved understanding about how these moorland landscapes have evolved, and their characteristic features will help moorland owners and managers, in partnership with publicly-funded agencies, conserve them in future as landscapes rather than solely as habitat or sources of income from sporting use. \nPublic: The major beneficiary of this research will be visitors to the AONB's moorlands. The tourism industry is a mainstay in the rural economy of the Yorkshire Dales, generating more value than agriculture. Visitor information is currently focused on industrial remains and habitat. This project bridges both and provides new information about the historic and current management of the landscape. Better public understanding will generate greater interest and engagement with the natural and cultural heritage of the moorland landscape. \nHow will they benefit? The AONB will benefit from the research directly with the student providing the data and analysis necessary to frame the 2009-14 management and heritage strategies as they become operational. The transfer of knowledge will be a key part of the student's placement within the AONB and it will take these forms: Lectures and guided walks (both open public events and those dedicated to local and national interest groups, including the Country Land &amp;amp; Business Assoc; Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust; Ramblers Association; National Trust) as part of AONB events; an interactive map-based webpage providing information on the landscape archaeology and buildings through historic information and images and features on people and communities within the AONB; a download/podcast explaining landscapes and features encountered on popular routes at particular signposted points (information also available as a leaflet from AONB). These contributions will ensure that the research has a direct impact on the future understanding, appreciation and management of the landscape resource. \nWhat will be done to ensure benefit? The relationship between the AONB, the student and the research outcomes will be part of the formal agreement between the three parties (including the UoY). A copy of the thesis will also be deposited at the AONB office. Public benefit will be ensured by advertised public lectures and guided walks and the webpage/downloads which will be available via the AONB site.
