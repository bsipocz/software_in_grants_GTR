It is the fruit of twenty years of research and reading, and uses contemporary 'cultural methods' to analyse political history, without sacrificing chronological development.\n\nFew of the over one hundred governments of the Third Republic were unambiguously right-wing. Consequently, the story of the right is often told as one of disunity and failure, underlying which is a tragedy of 'failed modernisation'. 'Anachronistic' religious and constitutional quarrels supposedly prevented the right from creating a united, conservative party, and poisoned political life.\n\nR. R&amp;eacute;mond's Les Droites en France (1956, 1981) is the obligatory reference point for historians of the right. His book explained the disunity of the right as the consequence of the persistence of three unique mentalit&amp;eacute;s (Catholic traditionalist, modern liberal-conservative, and Bonapartist). Notwithstanding its brilliance, R&amp;eacute;mond's efforts to fit individual movements into his schema is unhistorical, a problem compounded by implicit use of modernisation teleologies. The three volume Histoire des droites en France (ed. Sirinelli, 1992) does not depart radically from R&amp;eacute;mond's story, and follows a traditional political history approach. Women and gender are absent, for example. While individual contributions contain important insights, this multi-author book fails to provide a coherent chronology.\n\nWhereas existing accounts derive the meaning of the history of the right from assumptions concerning what 'ought' to have happened - that is, the emergence of a constitutional conservative party -, my book explores the contested ideas of historical actors. I build on G. Le B&amp;eacute;guec's research into political networks, N. Rousselier's analysis of debate in the 1919-1924 parliament, and G. Noiriel's work on national identity. However, I question their assumption of a unified political culture.\n\nI divide the history of thet into three phases:\n1870/1889 the apogee of a populist right-wing politics\n1890/1928 the consolidation of the parliamentary republic, the gradual emergence of a constitutional right, and the marginalisation of right-wing populism\n1928/1940 the re-emergence of right-wing populism\n\nWithin this structure I highlight certain themes. \n\n- I argue that class and religious priorities were inseparable in the minds of protagonists, and that circumstances dictated which they prioritised.\n\n- I examine the relationship between elite and popular politics, bearing in mind the contested meanings given to 'elite' and 'popular'.\n\n- I argue that historians have underestimated the importance of Social Darwinism for the right, and its relationship to Lamarckianism and other forms of biopolitics.\n\n- I argue that historians have neglected the role of mercantilism in shaping the domestic and international politics of the right. \n\n- Following Le B&amp;eacute;guec, I explore the strategies developed by the right to ensure that public affairs were conducted by 'the best'. I develop his account by showing that the instability of French politics owed something to contradictory understandings of terms such as 'the best', 'competence', and 'experience'. \n\n- I show that gender was integral to right-wing politics, and that there was no automatic relationship between democratisation and the participation of women in right-wing movements.\n\n- I show that political ideologies were constituted not just from traditional political theory, but from notions that at first sight have little to do with politics - from management science to prejudices against the inhabitants of the Midi.\n\nChapters\nIntroduction\n1.
