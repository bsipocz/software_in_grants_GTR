Because of its widely distributed cultivation and high yields, it is considered a critical species in terms of food security in face of a growing world population. However, potato is particularly vulnerable to high temperature during various stages of its life cycle. Elevated temperatures strongly suppress tuberisation, negatively affect storage and shelf life of tubers and reduce fitness of seed potatoes. Breeding new heat-stress tolerant cultivars is an urgent need for sustainable increases in potato production, given the negative impact of the rises in temperature due to global warming. 
In this proposal, an integrated approach will be used by combining physiology, genetics, genomics, metabolomics and natural variation studies to analyze the impact of elevated temperatures on (1) sink-source relations of potato plants, (2) potato tuber development, (3) starch accumulation and tuber quality and (4) tuber dormancy. The outcomes of the project will be new knowledge of potato genes and their function that can be used in breeding programmes to increase yields in warmer climates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In this proposal, an integrated approach will be used by combining physiology, genetics, genomics, metabolomics and natural variation studies to analyze the impact of elevated temperatures on (1) sink-source relations of potato plants, (2) potato tuber development, (3) starch accumulation and tuber quality and (4) tuber dormancy. To achieve these aims both unbiased and targeted approaches will be employed. The unbiased approaches include the elucidation of phenotypic, biochemical and molecular responses to varying environmental conditions of selected potato genotypes (diploid populations, and a panel of tetraploid varieties and GMPs). Environmental conditions will include elevated and ambient temperatures in combination with different day lengths and light intensities. The plants will be phenotyped with respect to assimilate allocation, tuberisation, tuber yield, quality and dormancy. The genetic approach aims at identifying polymorphisms of candidate genes from diploid populations exhibiting a wide response to elevated temperatures. This will lead to the identification of genes and allelic variants that confer heat tolerance. The targeted approach is based on recent breakthroughs of the partners, which show that two linked regulators (StCDF_V and StSP6A) play a central role in the initiation of tuberisation. Our unpublished work suggests that StSP6A over-expression confers heat tolerance in transgenic potato plants. Therefore, the role of these regulators will be investigated in more detail in order to identify key components of the multiple signal transduction pathway(s). In addition levels of phytohormones known to regulate tuber initiation and dormancy will be manipulated and their impact on heat tolerance will be investigated.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the biological questions target the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of high temperature on potato crop productivity, we expect that the advance in knowledge of these mechanisms to have concrete economic and thus societal impacts. The outcomes of this project will be new knowledge on genes and alleles that can be used in breeding programmes to increase tuber yield under elevated temperatures. The production of EU seed potatoes that will perform well under higher temperatures will enhance exports to warmer climates and future-proof the EU potato industry against expected increases in EU summer temperatures. The plant breeding sector is essential to ensure that the genetic advances we shall make, deliver their full benefits to society. The involvement of several key European breeding companies, prepared to participate actively in this project, will ensure translation of scientific results to commercial production.
 It is envisaged that the demand for heat resistant potatoes will intensify with global warming. The value of a heat-tolerant cultivar is difficult to predict, but with many potato-growing regions expected to suffer yield decreases of up to 25% due to heat stress alone, the value of this trait will be significant. In the wider context of a globalised world economy, improved human nutrition anywhere in the world will improve overall global food security and thereby have a benefit in the EU and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356125</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Future-proofing potato: Mechanisms and markers for global-warming tolerant ideotypes</gtr:description><gtr:id>2BEDF140-EDB8-4C69-8C31-1BE3ACD80247</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During this first 18-month period collaboration was established with all the groups and companies in the HotSol project.

This allows in addition to control (22&amp;deg;C) and heat treatment (29&amp;deg;C) for the entire plant to separately apply heat stress to either aerial parts of the plants (leaves) or to the belowground organs (tubers). Working with the cv. Agria, physiological and phenotypic parameters were measured. These data suggest that there are also signals from the tubers which may control heat response. Detailed metabolite and transcript profiles were obtained under the different temperature regimes imposed. These experiments confirmed a negative influence of an altered source/ sink balance on tuber starch content. Interestingly the levels of the signalling metabolite trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) changed in leaves and tubers. Since T6P was reported to play a role in flowering regulation in Arabidopsis, we searched for candidate genes coding for T6P synthases (TPS by in silico analysis and identified 2 members of the family that show high degree of sequence identity to the active TPS1 from Arabidopsis. Their function and expression pattern is further investigated. Microarray analysis revealed numerous differentially expressed genes. Currently some candidates (FKF1, LOX etc.) are further analysed. Various experimental set-ups such as different day length periods (16h/ 12h or 8h light) were tested which in general confirmed that negative effects on tuber quality (tuber weight, second growth, dormancy) are more pronounced in long day conditions (16h light). Several experiments confirmed a reduced accumulation of starch in tubers when plants were grown under elevated temperatures. The activity of sucrose synthase (SuSy) correlates with starch levels and may serve as a molecular marker. To unravel the molecular mechanisms the heat / cold plate set up is used to identify genes correlating with expression of SuSy or other starch biosynthetic genes. In addition, genomic annotation of genes involved in starch metabolism was improved and this information is being used to identify co-regulated genes.
WUR group obtained evidence for the involvement of CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (StCDF1) and StCDF3 genes in abiotic stress (heat and drought) sensitivity in potato plants. StCDF1 protein also transcriptionally represses StCO1-3 genes, a set of transcription factors able to indirectly repress the potato tuberigen StSP6A. Transgenic plants with reduced expression levels of StCDF1 showed high level of tolerance to drought and higher tolerance to heat stress. Interestingly, plants over-expressing StCDF3, another gene of the same family repressed by StCDF1 also presented a higher tolerance to drought and clearly improved growth and yield during heat treatments. Plants with different levels of StCDF1 presented a strong stomatal conductance phenotype, being lower in plants with low StCDF1 expression. Furthermore, in early potato genotypes, with more stable StCDF1, stomatal conductance is also greatly reduced. Transgenic plants with low expression of StCDF1 also have a decreased basal transpiration rate and they are extremely resistant to drought stress. On the other hand, a decrease in the transpiration rate has a negative effect on yield and plant production under heat stress. They explain the antagonism between treatments as a consequence of the miss-regulation in the StCDF1 gene expression, and concomitant incapacity of the plant to properly coordinate the induction of tuberisation with the needs of photosynthetic capacity under circumstances of environmental challenges. If transpiration is interrupted by stomatal closure due to StCDF1/StCDF3 miss-regulation, the major plant cooling mechanism is lost. They have established Chromatin Immune precipitation (ChIP) for potato. As a first approach we set up the experiment with the StCDF1 target genes StCO1-3. We show that StCDF1 protein binds close to ORF in StCO genes. Consistent with the ChIP result the StCDF1 binding site (AAAG) is preferentially present close to, or in 5&amp;acute;UTR ORF chromatin regions. They now also generated a SUC2 regulated GFP-tagged StCDF1 protein in potato. These plants will be used to carry out ChIP-seq analyse of the regulatory activity of StCDF1 throughout the genome.
CSIC: Transgenic SP6A OE lines (35S promoter) in cv. Spunta and Sylvana backgrounds have been generated and characterized. Compared to wild-type plants an improved tuber yield was observed at elevated temperature together with reduced secondary growth. OE- lines accumulated more tuber starch and lower soluble sugars. Tubers from SP6A OE-lines sprouted later than controls during storage at 4&amp;deg;C. Microarray experiments with the transgenic lines have been conducted in collaboration with FAU and data analysis is ongoing. An initial heat stress experiment was performed including potato plants with increased levels of gibberellic acids (OE of AtGA20-ox1) and reduced amounts of strigolactones (CCD8-RNAi lines).These lines were obtained from JHI/StA. Compared to their respective wildtypes AtGA20-ox-OE lines did not exhibit significant differences in tuber number/ weight and dormancy period. CCD8-RNAi lines formed already under control conditions less tubers.

A Hsc70 gene was identified previoulsy from a QTL related to heat response. Genotypes were selected from the population that exhibited extreme sensitivity or tolerance to heat stress. Further work confirmed that Hsc70 is highly expressed under heat stress. Constructs for HSc70 o/e have been generated using the GoldenBraid cloning system and transgenic lines are being re-generated. She used transient expression of the gene in Nicotiana benthamiana as a tool to confirm its role in conferring increased heat tolerance. During her work she observed an higher tolerance of plants towards increased temperatures when the plants were allowed to acclimate to 25&amp;deg;C before shifting them to 40&amp;deg;C treatment. The temperature shift experiment was perfomed with different cultivated and wild species showing different responses which will be further investigated.
In addition she reported about a first Exon capture (using Nimblegene design) experiment perfomed in JHI with the 06H1 population segrating for different yield under heat stress

A QTL explaining 12% of the variation in yield at elevated temperature was identified on Linkage Group 4. A candidate gene encoding a heat shock protein (Hsp70) in the QTL interval was identified. Allelic variants of the Hsp70 gene were identified and a particular allele (A2) was associated with enhanced tuber yield. Time-course experiments indicated that the A2 allele-specific transcript responds more rapidly in both tubers and leaves on exposure to elevated temperature. The A2 allele of the Hsp70 gene was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Exposure of plants expressing the Hsp70 gene demonstrated greatly increased tolerance of elevated temperature assessed by electrolyte leakage assays of leaves, compared with controls. Transgenic potato lines (cv Desiree) have been generated, designed to over-express the Hsp70 gene. These plants are currently being propagated and will be assessed for heat tolerance in the next 2-3 months. In order to increase the resolution of our genetic analysis we are using exome capture analysis. An exome capture array has been developed on the Nimblegen platform, based on ca. 39,000 coding sequences identified in the potato genome. Based on the phenotypic analysis of the 06H1 population three bulks have been assembled based on their differential yield response to elevated temperature. Following exome capture, non-random distribution of sequence read-based polymorphisms between the pools will identify chromosomal regions that co-localise with the heat tolerance and candidate genes will be selected. During the assessment of genotypes with different heat tolerance responses, we observed a very strong acquired thermotolerance response in potato. Exposure to a moderately elevated temperature (25 C) results in protection on subsequent exposure to high temperature (40C). Consequently, we are characterising this response at the molecular level and shall investigate responses in different potato germplasm.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>project is still in progress and further information will be added in future</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6CA4B8E3-FB39-4C88-B1FB-27EC85BB252B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a7bafc1b2115.10873875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.eracaps.org/joint-calls/era-caps-funded-projects/era-caps-first-call-%E2%80%93-2012/future-proofing-potato-mechanisms</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A number of standard basic DNA pieces, named GBparts, were used as a starting point in the building of Hsc70 multigene structures.
