In this context, the role of information dissemination through information and communication technology (ICT) in improving rural welfare is highlighted. However, some fear that with ICT technological disparity will arise, and existing socio-economic inequality and poverty will be further exacerbated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will use randomised experiment and surveys before and after the experiment to investigate the impact of ICT on rural welfare in the Indian state of Karnataka. The two key aims of this project are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to unravel the linkage between information access and agricultural growth, rural development, reduction of poverty, and income and social inequality&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to identify the role of ICT as a potential instrument of rural information and empowerment for inclusive growth. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The randomised experimental methodology proposed here involves facilitating information access on key agriculture related services to households in some villages and not in others. Combining data from both surveys and the experiment, we investigate the impact of information dissemination on agricultural practices, household incomes, social network, risk coping mechanism and caste disparity. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>India's development priorities include poverty reduction and faster, more inclusive growth. Due to widespread rural poverty and high population growth, India must increase agricultural productivity. In the current debate among academics and policy makers on inclusive growth in India, there is a growing concern that poor people, especially in rural India, have benefited very little from rapid economic growth. Asymmetric information coupled with poor skill sets are considered the root cause, and inability of the rural poor to take advantage of opportunities in the markets, created by technology advancement and policy changes. Addressing the problem of asymmetric information is expected to empower the rural poor to take advantage of the market opportunities as well as overcome the skill set deficits in the long run, and therefore, enhances inclusiveness. The action research proposed in the current project using experimental methodology does precisely this - benefits the rural community directly, where e-governance facilities installed and access to range of information provided. The information will include both public and private services in the areas of education, health, agriculture, employment, financial inclusion, etc. These services will directly cater to the needs of the village inhabitants, local government as well as business. In recent years, there is a proliferation of government welfare programs for the poor to be delivered in the rural areas. But several of these services have not been delivered due to weak last mile organisational linkage. Proper design and use of the telecentres can help overcome this difficulty to a large extent and effectively reach the rural poor. With public access to information on these services, there can be some scope for transparency and lower corruption. Apart from directly benefiting the rural people, this project will inform the ongoing debate on some of the concerns raised.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>390164</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Farmers training</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F08C9DD7-1D05-4CE8-8EFF-31C4A85FA479</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A training programme was organised for the control farmers in Siruguppa on March 13. All three hundred control farmers were invited. This was held at the Agricultural Research Station and 87 farmers attended the event. A wide range of speakers came to talk to the farmers about a broad range of subjects. Speakers included Mr. Gorebal SM (Chief Manager of Syndicate Bank Bellary), Mr. Balekayi (Director of SYND rural self-employed institute), Mr. B K Obanna (AD, Dept. Hort.), Dr. T N Shashidar (Assistant Professor of Animal husbandry, UASR), Dr. Sushila (Assistant Professor of Entomology, UASR), Dr. Savitha (Assistant Professor of Pathology, UASR), and Dr. Basavannappa. The speakers cover topics like government program for minor millets (INSIMP), best management practices for millets, various schemes available for rural people from Syndicate Bank, goat rearing, and bee keeping. The training was well received by the farmers and they were able to ask the speakers many questions to clarify any queries that they had.
The first training programme was organised for the treatment farmers in Gubbi on March 20. A total of 150 farmers from three GPs (Kondli, Hosakere, Nallur) were invited. The program was held at the Taluka Panchayat office and 30 farmers attended the event. Speakers included Dr. Sujith (Head, Konehalli KVK) and Dr. Prakash (Assistant Professor of Entomology, UASB). They took questions from farmers on problems of redgram loss and areca nut pests. Dr. Sujith tried to promote two new varieties of ragi and paddy - ML 365 and aerobic paddy respectively. He discussed benefits and package of practices for these varieties. Mr. Srinivas was there and he asked farmers opinion about e-SAP tab service.


The farmers welcomed more information on several crops including plantation crops like coconut and banana and requested more such workshop to interact and discuss with experts from the local agricultural universities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461de3b9e8ff2.71751475</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/infocus/projects/headline_281496_en.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Despite generating only 15% of the world's agricultural value added, Indian agriculture provides jobs to 263 million rural people and hosts 375 million rural poor. Farmers in developing countries face a variety of challenges which prevent them from achieving the greatest possible crop yields. Since the year 2013, we have been developing research programme, aimed at providing rigorous empirical evidence on what motivates farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices to enhance productivity, and how the information provided can influence their behavioural biases (limiting profitable investments), seen as one of the main causes of sub-optimal agricultural practices. The partnerships fostered within the project between researchers and policy-makers involved several rounds of intervention using randomised control trials that combines rigorous research with impact at several levels of the collaborations. The primary beneficiary is the farmer with increased crop yields. The partnership resulted in skills exchange and capacity building among the multidisciplinary field team that is bridging the gap between the ivory tower and ground reality with feedbacks in either direction. The program was also able to influence the government policy from provisioning of only subsidised inputs to a more comprehensive supporting role to enhance crop productivity.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1211D8DE-E82C-4BD1-A19C-17B4BB2FA996</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5452434b058855.18638272</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project provide agricultural extension services to the farmers in India.
