It is envisaged that the report will form the basis of an integrated and consistent approach to data access both across WG and within other bodies that are linked to the WG. The fellowship will help place the WG at the forefront of developments regarding the implementation of measures that seek to maximise the benefits that can be gained from existing data resources through improvements in access and opportunities for data linkage. This programme will therefore also be of interest to other government departments in informing their data access strategies. 
It is acknowledge that the main benefits of the research programme are dependent upon whether or not the WG accepts the recommendations outlined in the final report. The active engagement of the academic community, data custodians and experts in the fields of data access and research support should ensure that the recommendations arising from the research programme are 1) sensitive to constraints of data custodians, 2) proportionate to the potential benefits that would arise from enhancements to data or data access and 3) practical. This approach should ensure that the recommendations are well considered and have the greatest chance of being implemented. 
Irrespective of this, the programme of research will be of direct benefit to policy makers across Wales. The data audit will raise awareness of existing data sources in Wales. If agreed with the WG, this could be published as a 'stand alone' reference volume for wider research community. Policy makers within WG, bodies affiliated to WG, local government or other public bodies will have greater awareness of data sources and could commission research to inform their decisions across a number of policy areas, reinforcing the importance of realising the maximum value out of existing data sources before commissioning new data collection exercises. This may be of particular importance to organisations where analytical resources are relatively limited. Such bodies will particularly benefit from guidance in relation to data collection and access that will arise out of the fellowship and the increased levels of evidence that analysis of the data that they collect will provide. 
Discussions with data custodians and policy makers within WG and other bodies will raise awareness and engagement of such groups with UK wide developments on data access. Discussions with ONS and experts from bodies that support and promote data access will also contribute to the increased consideration of issues specific to Wales in relation to data access arrangements. The engagement of both the academic community and public bodies in the research programme will help to further develop relations between both groups. 
Subject to the recommendations taken on board, in the longer terms (12 months+) a number of public bodies in Wales will begin to benefit from the programme. The utilisation of well established mechanisms for the release and access of data will also improve the security with which data about Wales is accessed and monitoring of how that data is used. In the longer term, the research conducted on these sources will provide WG with greater understanding of the economic and social circumstances of people living in Wales beyond that which is possible for the WG to achieve 'in-house' with limited resources. Several data sets will have been developed directly in response to monitoring or evaluation requirements, such as surveys of participants or businesses supported by projects funded by European Structural Funds. As such, the analysis of these sources will be of direct interest to policy makers within WG, the UK and in some cases Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31370</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rhys Davies (WP3.3) 25.11.16 - Making Sense of Official Estimates of Trade Union Membership, Labour Force Survey Users Conference, UK Data Service, Manchester University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E06F30D-BC4A-420E-A9EF-60FF95C459A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper delivered at the UK Dataservices' Labour Force Survey Users Conference on 25 November 2016.

The existing Census-based UK Longitudinal Studies are the Office for National Statistics England and Wales LS (1% sample of the population), Scottish LS (5% sample) and Northern Ireland LS (28% sample). Whilst the design, content and coverage of these studies varies, it is the inclusion of Census data that is crucial to their importance as a research resource. Unlike other devolved administrations in the UK, the Welsh Government does not have legal authority for conducting the Census in Wales, with ONS being responsible for conducting the England and Wales Census. This poses a significant barrier to the establishment of Wales Longitudinal Study similar to those established in other devolved nations. The absence of such a resource limits the ability to conduct research about the population of Wales in areas where law making powers have been devolved to the Welsh Government. 


The two primary aims of this project have been to: 
? Identify and evaluate the options for creating a 100% 'population spine' to facilitate analysis for detailed population sub-groups and to act as a basis for linking administrative and survey data sets for Wales, with particular attention being given to examining issues surrounding the inclusion of Census data in to such a study. 
? Examine the extent to which the use of 'richer' social survey data sets can be maximised through using statistical matching or regression-based imputation methods to 'fuse' retrospective anonymised survey data to the 'population spine' in order to create a simulated population of Wales. 
The project included a literature review, discussions with key individuals in Government Statistical Agencies and Data Access Infrastructures and exploratory analysis of relevant administrative and survey data sets. This project is closely related to the ONS Beyond 2011 (B2011) Census Replacement Programme and the work of the UK Administrative Data Taskforce (ADT). The recommendations of the B2011 Programme could have a significant impact on the future landscape of Census longitudinal studies and the data that are available.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The responsibility of ONS for conducting the Census in Wales and their responsibilities to Census respondents as custodians of Welsh Census data has practical implications in terms of where and how a WLS could be constructed. The desired WLS sample size of 100% would also have implications in terms of public acceptability and maintaining the confidentiality of respondents. Whilst it would not be feasible to create a 100% Census-based WLS as currently constituted, several options that warrant further examination remain: 
? In the absence of a 100% WLS, WG could work with ONS to explore whether mechanisms exist to make better use of the England and Wales LS, including as a spine to link administrative data. Whilst the sample size of the ONS LS may not support Wales-level analysis for detailed population sub-groups, projects that focus on linking administrative data for broader groups could be useful in highlighting the research potential of a Census based WLS. 
? WG should consider whether it would be desirable to commission the ONS and the Health and Social Care Information Centre to produce a Census based WLS of sufficient size to support Wales-level analysis.
? WG should consider the recommendations made by B2011 and the UK ADT in terms of maximising the use of administrative data as a population spine to inform the development of an alternative or complementary non-Census based administrative database.
? Administrative databases tend not to include detailed socio-economic data such household structure or social class. These problems present a significant practical and methodological challenge to the application of statistical matching or imputation techniques to a WLS where a population spine was based on administrative data. 
? There is currently uncertainty surrounding the recommendations that will be made by the Beyond 2011 Programme regarding the future design of the Census. However to be able to deliver a Welsh Longitudinal Study based on the Census, the Welsh Government would need to seek whether it can access Census data under future arrangements or consider whether they would wish to take responsibility for the Census in Wales.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>04B67912-3A5B-4593-8DAF-4E051DE12098</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cbd6f025974.46493317</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://wales.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/examining-feasibility-creating-wales-longitudinal-study/?lang=en</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3CA00ACA-718B-49F0-9012-2A3C62F72BDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Examining the Feasibility of Establishing a Wales Longitudinal Study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/155dc760f25434a3fea8bb5621c03093"><gtr:id>155dc760f25434a3fea8bb5621c03093</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davies, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISBN 978-1-4734-0670-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cc0c82528a8.55742252</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011398/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
