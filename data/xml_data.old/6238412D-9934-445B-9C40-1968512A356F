The answer was to be able to walk without visible (or audible) assistance. Following some initial work in an EPSRC project called RELEASE, WAM is starting on the road to developing just this sort of assistive technology: an exoskeleton that can be worn and that can also act as a muscle so that it can support the whole walking cycle, providing support and control to the user and enabling them to walk otherwise unaided. We have selected some of the likely possibilities from those explored during the RELEASE project and WAM will develop these further, combine them and test them against the strength, stiffness, flexion and strain requirements of the walking process. Three technologies will be explored in parallel: (1) using Vanadium Oxide (V2O5) as a chemical actuator, (2) using magnetic gels as a dynamic controllable mechanism and (3) using interlockable ceramic tiles as a surface medium. 

V2O5 is able to flex when exposed to an electrostatic potential and can exhibit strength (about 10 times the strength found in skeletal muscle) so this would seem to be a useful substance to use as the basis for an actuator. Macroporous magnetic gels can be used to compress rapidly under a magnetic field to deliver drugs (by squeezing the drugs from the pores as the material compresses under the influence of an induced magnetic field). Interlockable ceramic tiles can provide the stiffness needed for the rigidity needed by a skeleton, but once unlocked an allow the structure to bend in a required direction. 

These will be tested separately and in combination to see if the V2O5 working with the magnetic gel could act as a sufficiently strong actuator and key for the locking/unlocking mechanism so that the material can demonstrate sufficient strength, stiffness and strain capabilities to be worth scaling up in a future project to assist walking. Other possibilities would also be available from such material - it does not have to be used only for walking as it could be used for other joints which can need support but which also need to bend - elbow, wrist, ankle as well as knee are all candidates for such support. Also, it might provide an interesting support where it is desirable to make the assistance variable - when the person needs support and when they would benefit from being encouraged to take on the activity themselves. A variably flexible material of this sort would therefore be of use in conditions such as limb fractures (where absolutely fixed support is essential at one point on the process, but rehabilitation of associated muscles would be beneficial as the facture is healing, but is still weak, before the fixed support can be removed) or conditions such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome where support needs might vary. While the technological work is underway we will be working with a patients' group and a group of clinicians to understand more about what end users might be looking for in their assistive technology and how this particular type of support might be useful for them. It is important to realise that this is a novel way of providing dynamic support for activities such as walking and thus there is a sense of all sides needing to understand how best to use the technology as it emerges from the laboratory. 

The present project will not deliver the full working prototype of a walking support system, but it will develop, test and show what can be done in terms of the material and its control system and the extent to which this approach to actuation of locomotory support could be achieved. The final tests will show how much stiffness and strength it can deliver and thus whether or not this is the right way to proceed in further projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WAM is an early-stage (TRL 1-2) project, so we do not expect products to emerge from the project itself, but it provides the essential basic work from which novel assistive technology products will follow in due course. Therefore the impacts to be achieved from WAM are in the long term. These will be in the form of assistive technology and materials development.

Assistive Technology (AT)
WAM is generating a new approach to AT, namely that the possibility of making active support for actions that a person currently cannot - or can only with difficulty - make on their own, but that can also adjust the degree to which the support is provided. This allows for a number of possibilties in terms of rehabilitation and therapy. First, it would be possible for adjustments to be made during use. This could allow, for example, a support for a limb fracture, which is currently static, to be able to be adjusted to stimulate muscle use while the support is still in place to support the healing process and thus speed up recovery. Secondly, it allows for the support to be varied in use in order to encourage/stimulate natural muscular activity so that the AT device does not replace the natural process, but rather supplements it as required and stimulates it to become more proficient over time. Thirdly, it could provide active support for complex actions - walking, arm movements, neck movements - for people who are currently unable to achieve these at all. These types of impact on therapeutic activity will be discussed with patients and clinicians throughout the present project and the means for translation will be developed in order to be ready as the technology develops. UCL, together with UCL Partners, has 25 hospitals, including the national tertiary referral orthopaedics hospital (RNOH), and the UCL Institute of Biomedical Engineering is setting up a formal translation assistance system to accelerate translation of all biomedical engineering research into clinical practice. WAM would be inserted into this process so translation should be rapid. In addition, ASPIRE, together with its patient groups, will enable us to pursue the use of the technology directly with patients.

Materials development
WAM's ability to function as a dynamic but flexible external support system capable of supporting activities such as wrist and arm flexing, knee and hip bending, as well as supported neck rotation presents new opportunities for smart materials in other areas both within the healthcare technology field and elsewhere. We will explore how well the concept would work with other applications in the aerospace, automotive, and white goods industries, where such flexibility might offer new opportuities for supporting mechanisms which require changes in stiffness, strength and strain as part of normal operation. The interest of URT in being involved in the project shows that an innovative composites company sees some value in entering this market.

We will also develop new testing methods, new ways of analysing the interactions between pedestrians and their immediate environment so that sufficient knowledge can be gained to extend the capabilities of the assistive technology. This will potentially turn into new products and techiques which could be exploited, not only within materials and research but also in the application of rehabiltation therapies.

WAM is thus a transformative project, exploring new ways of achieving a different type of support for people requiring assistive technology to help them move around.

The impact is not only within the UK. The generic problems being tackled by WAM also apply elsewhere in the world: China, for example, currently has 67 million people using wheelchairs and is expecting a similar increase in population as the rest of the world because of increasing life expectancy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>994065</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Two programmes that reveal the amazing stories behind everyday objects of desire and how they are miraculously transformed from raw materials into the very stuff of the modern world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>74E87D65-8A80-4482-9D82-03C91E823098</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Broadcast on BBC4 in the UK.

Masterclasses and talks for the public included flintknapping with archaeologist Karl Lee, a 'smell walk' with Dr Victoria Henshaw and 'bodging' and repairing with designer Jasleen Kaur, for example. During our large open days we threw wide the doors of the Makespace and the Materials Library to the public and organised various making activities designed to appeal to seasoned makers, first-time tinkerers and families alike, and curated a themed selection of materials for visitors to explore in the Materials Library. Themes have included 'Plastic Fantastic', 'Luminescence' and 'Foam', for example. We have had many return visitors at these public open days, and the public engagement programme has inspired people to explore new areas of interest, acquire new skills, and engage with experts in diverse fields of materials research and making. For a full list of events up until March 2014, see our annual report: http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/blog/2014/05/first-year-report and for events since then, see the URL below.

Between 2013 and 2014 we hosted eight public open days at UCL with a total attendance of approximately 3500 including a high representation from families and children. Through these events the public get both a taste of the Makespace and Materials Library, and a chance to meet and interact with our wonderful and knowledgeable community of members. This public programme is extremely popular, with many events being booked up in less than five minutes of being released and with extensive waiting lists forming. For example, 1156 people applied to attend Roja Dove: An Olfactory Experience, for which there were only 40 spaces available. We instigated the first Festival of Materials and Making at King's College, and have instituted an annual Festival of Stuff at UCL.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54626865b9f8b0.95985097</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Institute of Making - Research Workshops and Events 2014/2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8DEF18AC-25A8-4AC0-A1B4-DFE6476123DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Institute of Making curated 14 research workshops and events in 2014-2015, reaching participants both within and outside of UCL's research community.

Findings will inform development of technology from a spinal cord injury user's perspective.

Findings will inform on the biomechanical needs currently satisfied by existing exoskeleton technology and propose a specific path for truly user friendly exoskeleton technology. The force sensors developed will enable researchers to fabricate low cost sensors and spread the use of Opensource technology. Once the NHS research protocol is performed, it is expected to set a standard of parameters that any elbow exoskeleton should comply with if the end user is a spinal cord injury patient with injury.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>959209D3-BA14-44B0-9205-4742FC5B3DDA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bd245553a80.41742491</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cege.ucl.ac.uk/arg/WAM/Pages/WAM.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Institute of Making is not aligned with any one course and no formal teaching goes on in the space, but a great deal of informal learning and teaching happens here. We have gone to great lengths to curate the space itself in a way that encourages students, staff and researchers to interact with each other whilst using the equipment and library. By having members from diverse backgrounds and disciplines sharing the same space, they can, and do, learn from each other. This happens organically when undergraduates learn about the practice of research by working in the same space and using the same equipment as PhD students, postdocs and staff. Equally, researchers sometimes learn about making techniques from their students. Our summer studentship scheme has played a crucial role in developing teaching-research interaction; they funded an undergraduate student to do interdisciplinary research over the summer through a collaboration between two different departments.
