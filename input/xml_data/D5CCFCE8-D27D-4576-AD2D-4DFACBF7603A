During the last twenty years, French, German, Italian, Czech, Norwegian, American, and English authors and directors have been inspired by the myth of Caravaggio. Through the analysis of a varied corpus of 'texts', this project explores how some features of the baroque, as theorized by the Italian semiotician Omar Calabrese, allow writers/directors to use the past creatively, so renewing it. Caravaggio's style of painting transformed the spectator into a protagonist, turning art into a potential tool for changing the world. Caravaggio, however, is also a painter who raises the issue of pleasure in representation whose paintings transgress the limits between aesthetic, illusionistic, and erotic pleasure across media (both visual and verbal) and genres. \n\nExcept for Leo Bersani's and Ulysse Dutoit's monograph on Derek Jarman's film Caravaggio (London: BFI, 1999), most of the research carried out on literary representations of Caravaggio forms part of a wider work on a specific author (e.g. Vincenzo Consolo and Andrea Camilleri). To date no attempt has been made to analyse Caravaggio's impact across various genres and different contexts. \n\nThe simultaneous application of iconography and narratology appearing in two seminal texts by Mieke Bal, Reading Rembrandt. Beyond the Word-Image Opposition (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 1991), and Quoting Caravaggio: Contemporary Art, Preposterous History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999) fails to explore entirely direct quotations of Caravaggio's works. Yet this is where the move from the baroque to postmodernism takes place. Caravaggio is now a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThus my project is necessary for the following reasons:\n\n1.Through a thorough analysis of neo-baroque poetics in relation to its seventeenth century source, this project adds to the debate on the relationship between the baroque and postmodernism.\n\n2.It promotes a reflection on the relationship between high art (of which painting is a prime example) and popular culture, by focusing on one cinematic example and a wide range of texts belonging to different genres (historical metafiction, detective fiction, homo-erotic aesthetics) and promoting the study of lesser known authors alongside more established ones. In the case of well-established writers this project offers a new perspective on their work (e.g.: Consolo, Camilleri are extremely well-studied authors, but very little - and in some cases, nothing - has been done as regards their interest in Caravaggio).\n\n3.It returns to the art historical canon, by showing how the process of citation is vital to the new art but also changes the source from which it is derived. In recent exhibitions about Caravaggio writers were invited to give talks inspired by the event (Dario Fo and Franca Rame's lecture/show for the 2003 exhibition in Rome), or to write stories in honour of the Lombard painter (Henning Mankell, Andrea Camilleri, Florian Illies, and Ingrid Noll in the 2006 exhibition in D&amp;uuml;sseldorf).\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25407</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004818/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
