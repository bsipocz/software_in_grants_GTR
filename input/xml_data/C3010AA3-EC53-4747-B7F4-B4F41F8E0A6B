'Performance training' here not only includes preparation for aesthetic performances by actors and dancers, but also refers to education, apprenticeship, rehabilitation and other broader categories of preparation for the performance of social roles and biological duties. 'Anatomy of Performance Training' aims to make a contribution to research into 'training' as an emerging contemporary ideology by contemplating the functions of different body parts in the practices implicated in this ideology.

The project will analyse the practical and symbolic functions of the hand, foot, ear, mouth and heart in these diverse practices to show how each plays a part in the preparation and maintenance of the whole (the body) for the performance of given roles. This is a distinctive way of thinking about the body in training which explains how training helps to keep the body whole and thus maintain the integrity of the roles that we are required to perform, both on stage and in the social realm. This concern for awareness of the body links disparate fields of knowledge: practical training, the philosophy of perception, and theories of the social reproduction of institutions and ideals. So doing shows one way how our 'embodiment' of training causes and maintains the 'worlds' around us and how these worlds (social, biological, cultural) cause and maintain, or threaten, the integrity of the body. 

The primary research for this fellowship project includes participant-observation of actor training techniques, religious training in a Benedictine monastery and training in physical regimes with historical associations with actor training such as Alexander Technique and Yoga. This knowledge is complemented by interviews with, and observations of coaches training elite athletes. All of this primary data is brought together with historical research into the development of training institutions and craft practices and the philosophies of the body to produce findings about the anatomy of training: about the role of the body's anatomy in training and about the 'anatomy' of training itself. These findings are pertinent to philosophy of the body but also to training practice; the meta-analysis of knowledge around training practices make observations relevant to those training how to train others. 

A monograph and a series of related videos will illustrate aspects of the embodied experience of training. The book has five core chapters, each one devoted to a single body part and accompanied by a short video that will be available online. Each chapter describes the uses of this body part in a wide range of training practices and explains how these uses relate to one another in the symbolic function of the body part in training. The videos accompanying each chapter offer a different way to appreciate 'embodied experience' by illustrating the role of the body part in a given practice. The fellowship will also include the development of a workshop for professional theatre makers at Theatre Royal, Plymouth, based on the findings of the research, with the aim of sensitizing performance trainers to how they train.

The structure of the book, and the accompanying videos, illustrate the central thesis: the coordination of individual body parts is necessary for the continuation of the whole as a whole, and that this coordination requires each part to play a particular role. This thesis, and the details of the roles of specific parts, will be explained in a five-lecture series at the Anatomy Museum, London; each lecture, which includes a screening of the relevant video, will focus on a single body part, with a specific emphasis on the project's implications for discourses and educational practices of 'vocational training'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three key beneficiary groups and one part-publicly funded charity organisation targeted by dissemination:

1) Professional theatre practitioners (e.g. directors, choreographers) working towards production and in community and education projects affiliated with the Theatre Royal Plymouth: 
Activities with this group offer training in the theory and practice of training itself to skilled people in non-academic professions aligned with performance practice. A workshop with practitioners working at Theatre Royal Plymouth will be developed, through iterations, and delivered as part of Theatre Royal's Practitioner Development Scheme. This is not a 'how to' workshop but rather offers new perspectives on existing practices and themes within multiple training regimes which may help them to think afresh about their own training practices, and to develop these as appropriate. 

2) The Theatre Royal Plymouth: 
The workshop within the Practitioner Development Scheme is envisaged to bring operational benefit to this part-publicly funded charity organisation, effecting change in organisational culture and 'talent management', enhancing the efficiency, performance and sustainability of the theatre's creative output. 

3) Professional performers and those participating in performance for community development:
This group will receive 'knock-on' impact of the findings as they work with the practitioners participating in the Development Scheme at Theatre Royal; the re-sensitised training practice of theatre makers participating in my workshop may lead to enhanced studio and rehearsal practice for professionals and those taking part in community and education projects with the Theatre Royal. For professional performers, the benefit of working with training practitioners in new ways can contribute towards the cultural life of the region, and beyond. For participants working with Theatre Royal trained practitioners on Creative Learning (CI) projects, improved training practice contributes to the CI mission to build happier, healthier communities. 
 
4) Trainers, educators and those working in cultural industries in the UK and abroad. 
Impact here is conceived through communications activity, translating research to user communities in an accessible way. This group will benefit from the theoretical findings of the research, expressed through public lectures at The Anatomy Theatre at King's College and Peninsula Arts in Plymouth. These findings relate to the situation described by Maria Kapsali wherein, 'the arts and higher education sector have recently witnessed a proliferation of discussions on their social impact and significance, changes in their funding model, and uncertainty about their future growth and development' (Theatre, Dance &amp;amp; Performance Training, 'call for papers', 2013). This fellowship project adds to these discussions and helps to redefine some of their terms, with potential for cultural enrichment. 

Impact for these groups of beneficiaries is also envisaged through communications activity with potential to augment cultural organisational change, operational practices and creative output in the UK and internationally. These groups will be able to access the findings of the research via the online videos hosted on Methuen Drama Online (MDO). Trainers and educators will benefit by seeing old practices in new ways, illustrated through a visual language of the body on film. This may suggest attentiveness to new and different aspects of the embodied experience of training. The international and 'interactive' components of MDO enable communication and collaboration between trainers and educators working internationally and may help to facilitate improved training practice in international contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110664</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Week-long public lecture series at Old Operating Theatre Museum, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B10B967-EE97-4298-8CA2-1C9B010C61E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talks caused discussion of ideas within the research, and attendees from early in the week returned to talks later in the week with more visitors.

My findings have brought benefit to the Theatre Royal Plymouth, a registered charity by effecting change in organisational culture and 'talent management', enhancing the efficiency, performance and sustainability of the theatre's creative output.

My research has also benefited trainers, educators and those working in cultural industries in the UK and abroad. This impact has happened through communications activity. This activity has included a public lecture series and radio and online broadcasts of talks from my research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>96CAAEA1-EBBA-4F2C-A188-CDE9144B83FA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b5da76df289.75177948</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have developed further the philosophy of training to show how, we train because we are human and yet we become human because we train.

I am under contract with Bloomsbury for a third book, and follow up to the book that arose through this project. This third book builds on the findings of this project to add the philosophy of time to our understanding of training, in theory and practice. 

I have also found new collaborators, including Dr Kenneth Aggerholm, a philosopher of sport, and with whom I am authoring a paper for British Philosophy of Sport Association &amp;amp; European Association for the Philosophy of Sport 2017 Conference.
