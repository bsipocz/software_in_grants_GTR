STUDY OF AGEING</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002910/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Sleep has important effects on memory, co-ordination and executive brain functions. There is a relationship between the severity of sleep disturbance and these brain functions in clinical conditions such as Alzheimer?s disease. This suggests that sleep disturbance may be an important early marker of progressive brain disorders and that early treatment of sleep disorders may delay progressive brain disease.&lt;br />&lt;br />Miller &amp;amp; Cappuccio aim to explore the links between the quantity (ie duration) and quality of sleep in relation to the different types of mild brain impairment. They will use the data from approximately 10,000 men and women over the age of 50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), on whom self-reported sleep data is available.They will use statistical methods to explore the effect of social, behavioural and biochemical factors on these associations and will establish a baseline for future follow-up analysis of this data set. Publically accessible anonymously unlinked data sets will be used&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Sleep Health &amp;amp; Society Research Programme is focused on establishing the evidence of the role sleep and in particular, sleep disturbances play in underpinning short and long-term poor functioning and ill health. The Programme uses epidemiological tools to gather data that would be generalizable to the population at large. We use a variety of approaches: evidence synthesis of cross-sectional and prospective studies, direct cross-sectional and prospective analyses of population samples, controlled clinical trials. We maximise the impact of our research findings in several ways. The process by which we have done this has been to use both pre-existing networks and research relationships as well as developing new ones. Our research proposal is timely due to recent proposed increase in Government funding of dementia research. The Prime Minister's ambition is for Britain to be a world leader in dementia research and care. The content of our proposed study fits this context. 

We use several types of impact activities: (i) professional events - we have a track record of invited lectures on sleep worlwide; (ii) public engagement - we have held successful meetings open to the public (ThinkTank Science Museum in Birmingham, University of Warwick Ideas Caf&amp;eacute; initiative; (iii) press and communication activities with the aid of traditional (TV, radio, printed media) and innovative (web-pages, podcasts, i-casts, webinars) means - cf. appearances on BBC and ITV, a three-days sleep series on Korean TV, radio interviews worldwide (cf. BBC, ITN, Sky, CNN, CBC, CBS, RAI), web-productions, podcasts, i-casts; (iv) collaborations and networks (local, national and international) -partnerships with Harvard Medical School, Boston University and Monash; (v) training and transfer of skills - research-led Sleep Medicine teaching module and student research projects leading to publications; (vi) involvement in policy making - cf. EWTD for Junior doctors, American Federal Policy on shift-wrk of truck drivers. One main vehicle of academic dissemination remains through high-impact peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. Since 2005 we have published more than 35 papers and book chapters and the first Textbook of Sleep Epidemiology and Public Health. Milestones and measures of success of our impact activities will be reviewed every 6 months (Web &amp;amp; media hits, citations of papers, Website statistics, exit questionnaires at public engagement events).

Local presentations will be made at the departmental seminar series to disseminate findings and to invite critique from our peers. Publications will be supported by a press release by our Media team (in consultation with the ESRC), with summaries on our website. In addition, as part of the locally funded Boston-Warwick partnership the applicants will visit Boston University to present the results. Findings will be included in the Study Module on Sleep Medicine. 

The project has the support of our Media Relations department. They will liaise with the ESRC so that findings can be disseminated to the general public through our website and by press releases. We will organise show case events to publicise our findings. These events will be open to the wider university community and to members of the public. 

Both applicants have experience in the development and implementation of public health policy (cf WHO collaborating centre for Nutrition). Their research in the cardiovascular field has had a direct impact on both policy formulation and implementation and has been instrumental in changing public health guidelines. Findings will be targeted to public health departments and policy makers. The applicants have experience in disseminating information to general practitioners to assist in the implementation of the BHS/NICE guidelines on the management of hypertension. Moreover, their textbook was designed to reach prevention specialists, policy makers, sleep researchers, clinicians.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>141144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mental Health Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Meetings/Discussions with Mental Health Foundation</gtr:description><gtr:id>530C2FB2-F330-4E98-A00B-B9063AD5A809</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Letter of support for grant application to ESRC SDAI (phase 2) for grant application &amp;quot;The role of sleep in amnestic an non-amnestic cognitive decline: Prospective associations in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)&amp;quot; .

The URSS scheme is open to all Warwick undergraduate students and is designed to enable students to develop their capabilities as a researcher, to actively engage in the production of new knowledge at the University, and to provide an opportunity to inform choices for future study or employment. This event showcased posters from all the students who had taken part in the scheme and allowed students to discuss their projects with other students and members of staff.

The URSS scheme is open to all Warwick undergraduate students and is designed to enable students to develop their capabilities as a researcher, to actively engage in the production of new knowledge at the University, and to provide an opportunity to undertake specific research training.

A chapter in a book was produced as an output to the detailed literature review. This was co-authored by the URSS student and the ESRC grant team.

The talk generated a lot of interest and questions on sleep and ageing. A discussion was held as to whether new measures could be included in future waves of ELSA to enhance the measurement of sleep. 
I was made aware of the presence of a small cohort of ELSA participants who have had detailed activity measurements which might be useful for validation of sleep questionnaires in the elderly.

Wider awareness of our findings. A lady representing a group of individuals in Hackney, which has received a very large Big Lottery grant has invited me to speak to their group about our findings. Other individuals came to see me afterwards to ask more detailed questions with regards to sleep.
Members of the ELSA team will forward details of the cohort on which more detailed measures are available. It is expected that this may lead to new avenues of research, and potentially new funding applications and publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54465fd29c5a43.90044087</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Warwick Undergraduate Research Scholarship scheme (URSS)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Warwick</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>91AED1D3-145F-4F0C-B31A-0DA8580EB288</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee3ae6a5ee3ae7e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My understanding from the e-mail of 17th September from Anna Billingham is that this report is not due until June 2015.

Our findings have been used to generate a Policy Brief, which was presented at an Age UK event and which is currently accessible through their website. It has generated interest from Age UK and the Mental Health Foundation who have agreed to partner with us on future grant applications. We believe our work will contribute to the enhancement of the quality of life for older populations. The findings published in PLOS ONE generated media interest, with an article on the front page of the Daily Express entitled: 'NEW WAY TO BATTLE DEMENTIA', and continuing on page 5.
Other media outlets also reported on our paper. Subsequently, I have been invited to present our work at a number of meetings aimed at both academia but also for policy makers , MP's and general public. The work has also led to new grant applications and PhD proposals.

***Further information taken from previously approved Key findings report is shown below.

Scientific Impact.
Findings from this grant and associated new collaborations, have led to four scientific publications (see publication section), and three further grant applications (see collaborations). Further manuscripts are in progress. Findings have been presented at a variety of national and international scientific meetings (Ten oral; five poster presentations). 

Economic and Societal Impact
Our results have been disseminated to the lay public as well as to professional and scientific audiences. A policy brief was presented to *Age UK (Policy Brief: Sleep, Health and Society: Is sleep important for cognitive wellbeing. For ESRC Age UK Showcase Event). Moreover, the outcomes have been widely publicised in both the national (http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/485373/A-good-night-s-sleep-can-cut-risk-of-dementia) and international press (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health/Sleep-problems-linked-to-memory-functions/articleshow/37331430.cms).
Our work was presented to approximately two hundred individuals a result of an invitation to speak at the Warwickshire Women's Institute Scientific Seminar series. The findings from our recent research paper (http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100991) were presented at an open-access event on 27th June 2014. Over 50 people, including members of the general public were in attendance. Videos of the lectures are available (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/mhwellbeing/sleep). Excellent feedback was received. One individuals stated that they would &amp;quot;seek further help from GP&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;would regulate their sleeping hours more&amp;quot;. Others stated that it &amp;quot;makes you think about life choices&amp;quot; and, that it had &amp;quot;made them aware of more avenues for research&amp;quot;.

Main Findings
Our aim was to investigate the association between sleep disturbances and cognitive function in individuals from an ageing population. Our funding facilitated funding from the University Research Scholarship Scheme to support one of our Medical Students, to conduct a full literature review of the subject. This latter has been presented and accepted as a book chapter. 

We analysed data from 8,789 individuals, from Wave 4 (2008) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). As there was a significant interaction between sleep and age, subsequent analyses were conducted in younger (50-64 years) and older (65+ years) adults separately. Using analysis of covariance, and after adjustment for multiple confounders, we demonstrated that in younger adults duration of sleep explained 15.2% of the variance in amnestic cognitive function (ACF) and 20.6% of and non-amnestic cognitive function (nACF). In older adults the estimates were 21.3% and 25.6% respectively. However, whilst both short and long sleep were associated with lower cognitive function in younger adults, only long duration of sleep was associated with lower cognition in older adults. 

For sleep quality, there was a statistically significant association between sleep quality and both ACF and nACF in the older age group, but not in the younger age group. Sleep quality explained between 15.1% and 25.5% of the variance in cognition. Moreover, the steeper association between sleep quality and ACF in the older than the younger group was observed at any level of sleep duration (See PLOS ONEP1 (http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100991)). The study has been presented at national and international scientific meetings and received coverage in the national and international press. 

Further Research and Funding
Our work has fostered many new collaborations leading to further publications and grant applications as outlined elsewhere. We are now planning to apply for funding to investigate the prospective association between sleep and cognition. For the latter we have established a new collaborative research partnership, with the Mental Health Foundation, Age UK and Clinical colleagues. A policy brief was prepared for Age UK. An additional manuscripts, utilising data from this study is also in preparation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? Through our public impact event we have raised awarness of the importance of sleep in a number of individuals from our community (see above).
? Our work has been widely discussed by charitable organisations (Including MHF and AGE UK).
? Our work is being disseminated via the Age UK website via Policy Briefs.
? Raising clinical awarness may lead to early detection and management of sleep disorders in individuals with memory problems.
? Our work may be used as part of an evidence base required for policy and for pathway change for the management of individuals with sleep and memory problems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F2E34F06-56E3-4F7E-9F15-54A88F775C75</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f7b57bc9476.84654379</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
