This would permit early detection of infections which can lead to rapid and profound loss of vision, and allow accurate targeting of treatment through the unambiguous identification of the nature of the infection. The project includes instrumentation development, laboratory and clinical trials, and the pursuit of a detailed commercialisation plan which includes the identification of potential manufacturers and licensing partners.


Infections of the cornea in the eye can lead to profound loss of vision and in some cases complete destruction of the cornea within 24-48 hours. It is most common in soft contact lens wearers with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 per year. Infections may be caused by bacteria of various types, fungi, viruses and amoebae. Identification of the responsible organism is crucial to selection of appropriate treatment, but techniques have progressed little since those developed by Pasteur and earlier workers in the 18th and 19th century; samples are taken from the infected area and attempts made to culture the organism in laboratories where growth rates vary: it may be several days before organisms can be identified, while the infection grows much more rapidly in the eye. In addition, only in about 50% of cases can laboratory tests identify any growth at all. 

Certain bacteria are known to emit fluorescent light when illuminated with an ultraviolet light. Our project aims to characterise the fluorescence from bacteria known to cause problems in the eye, using laboratory-grown cultures. We will then install a source of UV light, together with focusing optics and a fibre optic, onto a spectrometer suitable for installation in slit lamp as found in a hospital ophthalmology department, and use this system to detect the tell-tale fluorescent signature, first in a laboratory, and then (subject to medical ethics committee approval) in a limited series of trials in a hospital, and demonstrate the ability of the system to quickly and reliably detect certain types of eye infection. This device, if proven, could offer the potential to save the sight of hundreds of people each year by allowing treatment decisions to be made more quickly than has been possible to date.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119613</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mr Jeremy Prydal: Ophthalmology</gtr:description><gtr:id>739A91A0-3B81-48A5-92D0-6F3F52368879</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research paper on Scleritis (Bannister, Prydal et al).

Initial work from the research led to a peer-reviewed paper, and the project has now expanded to include fluorescence spectroscopy. This work has been used to file a patent application relating to the in-vivo application of the technology, and has been identified as a promising technology for use in a broader range of clinical targets (including not just the eye but the lungs, skin and other regions). Ex-Vivo tests of the autofluorescence technique have been carried out on freshly resected lung tissue and skin melanomas with encouraging results, and work on this area continues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>87C5DE80-CDA1-488C-9DC2-C8728E38FD7F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460b6499d7cf5.86924101</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The detailed analysis of the spectrum of light from the body can yield information relevant to the diagnosis of a number of serious conditions including scleritis, infection, and cancer. We are developing instrumentation which exploits this fact, to provide rapid identification of the causes of infection, or the presence of cancerous or pre-cancerous tissue. Advantages of the technique are that it is fast (minutes, rather than days for laboratory culture plate tests), minimally invasive, and can be used to access parts of the body which are very challenging to access otherwise (e.g. the back of the eye).

In 2015/16 we showed that our technique is effective at distinguishing one of the major causes of corneal ulcers (acanthamoeba) from other known causes which are difficult to distinguish. This was the subject of a paper, and is leading to further developments in our expanding collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Use as a rapid tool for identification of microbial strains in the laboratory.
