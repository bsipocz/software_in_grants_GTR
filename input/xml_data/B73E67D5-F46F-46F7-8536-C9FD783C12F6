provide proof-of-concept to a wider market and technology raising. In some instances, they are also part of the final
service delivery; for example, in the case of Planet which augments larger satellites with CubeSats for responsive Earth
observation. This feasibility study seeks to determine the extent to which the momentum and agility of the CubeSat
marketplace and the progress made in overall performance can be applied and aligned to support and capitalise on the
emergence of space-based Quantum Key Distribution, harnessing the developments already underway within the UK in
payload systems. QKD offers a highly secure method for key distribution critical to modern data systems security from
financial transactions to military communications. The work will inform mission architecture, interface specification, system
testing and development roadmaps, and further provide a systems-view across stakeholders. The approach will identify
opportunities to accelerate and augment the technology or service readiness of space-based QKD using CubeSats.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The current QKD market is estimated at 30 MUSD, growing significantly as existing secure methods become compromised
or with the disruptive need / regulatory requirement for quantum-secure cryptographic systems. One comprehensive
market study [Jennewein, 2014], estimates 400 MUSD per year generated by space-based QKD systems within two
decades. 
A compelling argument for a gradual shift to quantum-secured cryptography, is the rising cost of cybercrime coupled with
exposure of weaknesses in conventional systems and the emergence of quantum computing. Whilst the true costs are
sometimes difficult to estimate given reluctance to admit or a failure to recognise breaches, reports indicate that the cost to
the US economy through cybercrime is up to 100 BUSD a year [Jeannot, 2013]. A UK survey [Sophos, 2011] found that
data security was amongst the top concerns of consumers, and that firms losing confidential data would be negatively
impacted.
 Within the team, BT Research and Innovation can provide insight as both a customer and service provider, providing input
as to the use cases and service delivery planning. The former, on the basis of its own networks where future progression
of modern protocols neccessitate distributed server and secure reconfiguration of its global control plane infrastructure.
The latter, as provider of critical communications infrastructure for major telecommunication players globally. In this
context CubeSats are seen for their potential to serve in establishing tactical or geographically remote nodes within
networks.
NewSpace has already helped to grow the UK space industry and export market, drawing investment from venture capital
in the US and elsewhere through 'silicon valley' modelled companies such as Spire and Kepler, driven by providing niche
data products or services. A typical satellite bus can sell for &amp;lt; 200-500 kGBP each dependent upon the complexity, with
each constellation requiring 10-100s of satellites. To date, from the clean rooms of Clyde Space Ltd based in Glasgow,
Spire report to be building a satellite a week, with 20 launched to date, and more ready and waiting for launch. Their
decisions to base and partner with the UK helps to grow a highly skilled local workforce, both within and throughout the UK
Presenting a solution or part-solution for space-based QKD using the now recognised CubeSat bus, presents venture with
a viable entry point for investment, and harnesses the ever increasing performance capabilities of these small space
systems. Identifying and developing niche applications for these systems will help to create or sustain employment both
downstream and upstream. It also can facilitate an earlier launch opportunity due to the standardised interfaces (PODs)
allowing CubeSats to fly on almost all Low Earth Orbit launches with minimal reconfiguration.
 Scotland, and Glasgow in particular, is emerging as a centre for NewSpace and CubeSats in the UK, complementing
existing excellence centred around Surrey in small satellites. A number of companies, including Spire, Clyde Space, Alba
Orbital, and Bright Ascension all offer solutions into this market. The growth of NewSpace has allowed companies such as
Clyde Space Ltd to grow from &amp;lt; 10 to near 100 in less than five years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/S000364/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
