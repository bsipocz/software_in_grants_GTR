The challenges in discovering a new molecular medicine are significant indeed - typically taking about 12 years from laboratory to patient, and costing of the order of $2 bn for each new drug. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is continually looking for new approaches to improve the efficiency and productivity of the drug discovery process.

The binding of a drug to its target protein can be likened to the fitting of a key into a lock, and the design of molecular 'keys' that have the appropriate arrangements of teeth and grooves to complement the 'lock' of the protein binding site is a major challenge - particularly when one considers that the protein binding sites (and hence the molecules that need to interact with them) are generally highly complex and three-dimensional in shape. One approach to this problem, that has become increasing important over the last 15-20 years, is fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). Here, the drug discovery process begins with fragments: very small molecules that are broadly analogous to an individual groove or tooth motif of a key. Fragments are then grown iteratively (to add more grooves and/or teeth) until promising larger and tighter-binding molecules are obtained. Although a relatively new approach, this method has already resulted in medicines that are being used clinically, for example against cancer.

Despite the remarkable rise of FBDD, significant chemical challenges for the field have been identified by industry. For example, limitations in the synthetic chemistry toolkit mean that growth of fragments is much easier in some directions that others. We will therefore expand this toolkit to enable efficient the growth of fragments in many different directions. Crucially, we will demonstrate that our fragment-oriented synthesis (FOS) toolkit can drive the discovery of ligands for pharmaceutically-relevant proteins. To ensure alignment with future discovery needs, we will collaborate with a pharmaceutical company that specialises in FBDD. We will ensure that our FOS toolkit becomes embedded in different types of drug discovery organisations to maximise the impact of the work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of the research are:

1. Companies engaged in drug discovery
Over the last 15-20 years, fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has risen to become a mainstream drug discovery approach that is exploited by all major companies as well as many more specialised organisations. Despite the remarkable rise of FBDD, significant chemical challenges for the field have recently been highlighted by industry. We will develop a fragment-oriented synthesis (FOS) toolkit to address these specific challenges: specifically, to enable the synthesis of more three-dimensional fragments, and to facilitate fragment growth along multiple complementary vectors. To illustrate the value of our FOS toolkit, we will demonstrate that it can drive the discovery of ligands for pharmaceutically-relevant target proteins. To catalyse follow-on highlight articles in high-impact journals (eg Science, Nature and Cell series), trade magazines/websites and drug discovery blogs, we will continue to work closely with the University's Press Office to issue press releases to coincide with high-impact publications. 

Realisation of the full impact of our FOS toolkit will require alignment with future FBDD needs. This alignment will be facilitated by project partnership with Astex. We will also hold a 1-day end-user workshop to which a wide range of drug discovery organisations (both industrial and academic) will be invited. Here, we will disseminate the early results from the project, and consult disparate end-users on their future FBDD needs. Following liaison with the University's research and innovation team, we will decide on the most effective mechanism to embed our FOS toolkit in many different drug discovery organisations.

2. The general public
Ultimately the main benefits of pharmaceutically-related research are societal, through the improved healthcare outcomes and/or quality of life for those patients receiving a new medication. Drug discovery is of huge interest to the general public, but the enabling role of chemistry in this process is under-appreciated. We will commission a mini-MOOC targeted at Year 12/13 pupils that imaginatively illustrates the role of chemistry in drug discovery. Leeds has already launched similar mini-MOOCs in other academic areas which have been undertaken by 1000s of school children per monthly run.

Press releases will be commissioned to publicise major publications and will stimulate media coverage that engages the general public - previous work publicised in this way from our groups has reached the national press. We will additionally continue to communicate our science in person through e.g. invited talks at schools, through presentations at education conferences and participation in the local Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique.

The accompanying Pathway to Impact document provides details of how the following specific objectives will be met:
PtI1. To sustain alignment with fragment-based discovery needs;
PtI2. To highlight the value of the FOS toolkit amongst end-users;
PtI3. To secure pathways to embed the FOS toolkit with end-users; and
PtI4. To engage the general public about the enabling role of chemistry in drug discovery.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>574490</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016618/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
