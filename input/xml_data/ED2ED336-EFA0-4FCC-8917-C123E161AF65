energy use and climate emissions (EP/H033610/1) (TEDDI call Part 1)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I000151/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>There is a general need to carry analysis of the possible broader, systemic impacts of technological transformations on energy and climate emissions of society, and to support policy developers, business strategists and technologists in considering this in their decision making. This need is particularly acute in the case of information technology, where the impact of the changes in behaviour and organisation which are enabled by new technologies is often far greater than the direct impact of the IT solutions deployed.One example currently in transformation is the news publishing and media industry. Over the next decade, a number of digital technologies will mature which will change the industry: high-speed digital printing, e-readers, personalisation technologies, mobile phone readable 2-D barcodes, etc. How the industry exploits these, and the resulting change in the overall system, could have a substantial (but not a-priori predictable) impact on the energy use and carbon footprint of the overall industry.Our research aims to develop methods and tools that would enable collaborative model building to take place at scale to enable shared learning to take place over large sets of stakeholders, and to trial this with a user community associated with the technological transformation of the news publishing industry. The following will be required:- Develop a toolset to allow less systems-aware stakeholders to either develop their own systems model, or explore their understanding of a given model, of the energy use and climate emissions impact of a specific technology intervention. The approach would require an appropriate graphical user interface that enables wide inclusivity.- Develop functionality which allows a community of stakeholders to explore the assumptions behind the models, critique them, and look at the impact of altering the assumptions in some way.- Work with a group of stakeholders to use prototypes of the toolset to develop initial systems models of the news publishing stakeholder system, how technology might transform it in the next 10 years, and the potential energy and climate implications of this. Gather feedback on appropriate design and functionality of the system iteratively. This will be done in collaboration with the Guardian Media Group.Allowing stakeholders in the industry to explore the possible broad impacts of different decisions as this technology transformation unfolds would increase the chance that a lower energy path is taken, and reduce the exposure of the industry to energy and carbon prices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the Research - The Guardian News and Media Ltd will benefit by having a deep and detailed understanding of the potential energy and climate impacts of the future business models they consider, and so will be able to integrate considerations around these into the strategic decisions they take. - The news media industry will benefit by having access to summary results of the work, and also interactive models which they can explore using their own data and assumptions. - The IT and Digital Print industry will benefit by having access to summary results of this work, which will give them a deeper understanding of the potential impacts of their technologies, and hence allow them to consider these factors in their research, product development and marketing. - The Business Strategy community (strategists within businesses, and also consultants in this space) will benefit from having access to a tool which allows them to create models and explore the impact of strategic decisions on energy use and climate impact. [For this benefit to be tangible, further work beyond SYMPACT will be required to generalise beyond the news media sector.] - Interested members of the general public will benefit from having interactive access to the models generated. This will increase understanding of the media transformation which is taking place, it's sustainability implications, and more generally systems thinking and its relevance to sustainability. - The RA and other members of the team will benefit from training in cross-disciplinary research combining systems science, computer science and sustainability analysis. They will also benefit from training in the use of agile software development methodologies in the context of a research environment.

During a session with the developers we explained those principles based on the end-to-end models we presented in research papers. The developers actively engaged in the discussion and we believe that we could influence their decision making at least infomally.

The Guardian has adopted the models developed by the project to provide a new KPIs.

The model was delivered to the Guardian sustainability team at the end of the project and is maintained by them.



We've been told the model of the digital sustainability is also being applied as a key performance indicator that is reported to the board.

Beneficiaries: The Guardian News Media

Contribution Method: The research resulted in a development of a quantitative model that is applied to calculate environmental impact from operation of ICT.

As part of the annual sustainability report of the Guardian newspaper one of the key project results was the assessment of the environmental impact through energy and carbon footprint of the digital news delivery. This was delivered as part of the &amp;quot;Living our values&amp;quot; report (http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/series/sustainability-report-2012 in the section Digital sustainability).



This report is highly respected in the business community. Our assessment is the first of kind in many ways and very likely influential in the media industry and possibly beyond.

Beneficiaries: The Guardian News Media directly. As a matter of public interest, this contribution has value to the broad public and other businesses, both nationally and internationally.

Contribution Method: The assessment resulted in a quantitative assessment of the annual carbon emissions through the online delivery of news. This was the first time, the Guardian could juxtapose the impact of the digital and the traditional print delivery.

Separately, the developed methodology can be used by the Guardian beyond the end of the SYMPACT research project to monitor and reduce their carbon emissions from digital. 

Through their leadership in the space of digital news media both as a technology innovator as well as an organisation with a strong commitment to sustainable issues, this assessment and its methodology is likely to be influential to the wider business community.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4DBD6423-0F8A-4B98-9773-97282683D3CA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-6412678990.897424de25b356</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The SYMPACT project has resulted in a more detailed and refined understanding of the impact of the digital transformation on the energy use and environmental impact of the News and Media industry, particularly Guardian News and Media ltd (GNM). Specifically, it has produced;

- A systems model of the longer term trends in the industry on digital product use and its impact on energy consumption.

- A detailed methodology, model and accompanying data of energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with digital product delivery. The model includes energy usage in the various data centres providing content, the network equipment to deliver it to the end user, and the devices used by the end user to view the service. This model is unique in its ability to be integrated with user behaviour data coming from services such as the GNM's Web Analytics, to give far more accurate impact figures for a given service. It's modelling of uncertainty is more refined than previous models.It has been applied to data from GNM, and the results have been made public in their sustainability report.

- Models allowing a service provider such as GNM to explore the impacts of business strategies, product design decisions, and larger industry trends on their expected energy use and GHG emissions. These have been applied to a number of scenarios which were identified in conversation with business strategists and technologists at GNM. For example, we explored the possible impacts of actively promoting a product based on an eReader.

- A visualisation tool for use by Guardian customers to allow them to explore the energy usage and GHG emissions associated with their use of GNM services. Customers were able to explore different access scenarios - such as video to a mobile phone over 3G, or 10 minutes browsing from a desktop PC, and compare energy usage across the entire delivery chain. This has been used by members of the public at the Guardian Open Weekend in 2012.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are relevant to anyone deploying a large scale high-bandwidth digital service - such as the BBC, Spotify, YouTube, etc. They an help such organisations design their digital services, particularly their deployment architectures, to reduce energy usage.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>13792DF2-2373-466D-B642-2771C1A3E27C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3460653613.750577592344</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Chapter Co-Authorship GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard ICT Sector Guidance</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA20EB38-1259-410E-9C94-063511E556F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In co-authorship with Dan Williams from the University of Reading we have contributed to the development of the GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard ICT Sector Guidance which at the time of the writing is coming to the end of the draft phase.
