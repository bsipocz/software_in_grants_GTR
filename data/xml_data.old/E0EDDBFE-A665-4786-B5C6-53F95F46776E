This process is called DNA replication and it begins at specific locations on the chromosome called replication origins. Bacteria have a single replication origin but organisms with large chromosomes, such as humans, need many origins. We have found that origins are unnecessary, and that cells without them can grow faster than normal.

Our research on DNA replication was carried out in Haloferax volcanii, a member of the archaea. The tree of life is split into three groups: eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Archaea are microbes renowned for living in extreme conditions such as acid pools and salt lakes. Haloferax volcanii comes from the Dead Sea, we chose it because the enzymes that carry out DNA replication in archaea are similar to those used in eukaryotes.

Haloferax volcanii cells without origins use an alternative method called recombination to start DNA replication. Recombination is a form of DNA repair, it is used to mend breaks in the chromosome. These breaks can arise when DNA replication is stalled, which happens if the DNA is damaged and cannot be duplicated. In fact, recombination is used to restart stalled DNA replication in all organisms, and this may be its primary function.

Before recombination can be used to restart stalled DNA replication, the enzymes that are being used to duplicate the DNA must first be removed, so that recombination enzymes can take their place. The disassembly of these enzyme complexes is carried out by a system that tags the proteins with a molecule called ubiquitin - this tag identifies the proteins that are destined for remodelling or destruction.

We have identified in Haloferax volcanii a network of enzymes that act in DNA replication, recombination and protein destruction. We will carry out a systematic search for other enzymes that belong to this network. Our goal is to uncover the regulatory mechanism behind the cell's response to stalled DNA replication. To do this, we will use our experimental data to create a computer model of the regulatory system. In turn, this computer model will tell us which genes and proteins are key to the process, and that we should examine in detail. This experimental approach is called systems biology.

By using Haloferax volcanii cells without origins, we can ensure that all DNA replication is started by recombination. In complex organisms such as humans, origins have become integrated with cellular processes and it is impossible to delete them without detrimental effects. Therefore, our simplified system will allow us to examine the regulatory mechanisms in detail.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>DNA replication is the most fundamental task that cells perform and is initiated at specific sites called origins. Replication is prone to stalling at DNA lesions and to avoid reinitiating at origins, stalled forks are restarted by homologous recombination. However, uncontrolled recombination can lead to genome rearrangements. To avoid this problem, ubiquitin-like modification of the replisome plays a key role in regulating the restart of replication. In eukaryotes, this is driven by the Cdc48 ATPase, which targets ubiquitylated proteins for destruction by the proteasome.

We have uncovered a regulatory network in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii that connects the processes of DNA replication, recombination and ubiquitin-like protein modification. To unravel this network, we will use a systems biology approach. A combination of transcriptomics, proteomics and two-hybrid analysis will be used to establish gene interactions. Cells will then be challenged by agents that block replication, loss-of-function mutations, and drugs that inhibit key regulatory enzymes. The results will be used to inform computational models, which will be refined using data from iterative rounds of transcriptomics and proteomics.

Similar regulatory systems have been studied in other model systems but H. volcanii offers a unique advantage: in origin-less strains, recombination is used constitutively to initiate all DNA replication. This stripped-down system is an ideal model to investigate how the restart of replication forks by homologous recombination is regulated. We will use a systems biology approach that combines high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic methods with genetics, genomics and biochemistry to investigate the links between replication, recombination and ubiquitin-like protein modification.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The outcomes of the proposed work will help with our understanding of genome replication and the human diseases associated with its dysregulation, including cancer. Genomic regions associated with replication fork stalling are hotspots for rearrangements in cancer, while proteasome inhibitors and drugs that modulate ubiquitylation are used in cancer chemotherapy. Biomedical implications of this work fit within the BBSRC's Strategic Research Priority 3 (&amp;quot;Bioscience for health&amp;quot;) and NSF Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) priority &amp;quot;to promote understanding of complex living systems at the molecular, subcellular, and cellular levels&amp;quot;.

The proposed work has implications for industrial biotechnology. Haloferax volcanii originates from the Dead Sea and it maintains an osmotic balance with its environment by accumulating molar salt concentrations in its cytoplasm. Enzymes from H. volcanii are adapted to function in high salt and this makes them of great value to biotechnology companies. Biotechnology implications of this work fit within the BBSRC's Strategic Research Priority 2 &amp;quot;Bioenergy and industrial biotechnology&amp;quot; and NSF priorities in the Catalysis and Biocatalysis program.

How will they benefit from this research?

The project aims to understand how DNA replication fork restart by homologous recombination is modulated by ubiquitin-like protein modification. There are striking parallels between origin-less H. volcanii and cancer cells - polyploidy, accelerated growth and unregulated replication. We anticipate that our results will be informative about the restart of stalled replication forks in humans, since the key enzymes involved in replication are conserved between archaea and humans. Therefore, this project could help uncover new enzymes that are involved in unregulated DNA replication in cancer cells - this would be a step towards improved therapeutic intervention.

Regarding the potential for industrial biotechnology, Drs Allers and Loose already collaborate with Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. The new enzymes we will uncover could include DNA polymerases, nucleases and helicases, which have numerous applications in DNA sequencing technologies. Industrial collaborators such as INVISTA Textiles Ltd have been keen to exploit our expertise in expressing halophilic proteins in H. volcanii. If commercially viable outcomes arise, steps towards exploitation will be taken in partnership with commercialisation services at the Universities of Nottingham and Florida.

What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?

In addition to traditional routes of publication, the outcomes from this project will be communicated through our web pages, social media, the press offices of the Universities of Nottingham and Florida, local schools and science discussion groups, and the BBSRC and NSF media offices. Potential future health benefits will be exploited via colleagues from the medical sciences and in partnership with commercialisation services at the Universities of Nottingham and Florida.

Professional development for staff working on the project

The project offers many opportunities for the postdoctoral researcher and graduate student to acquire new skills. The collaborative nature of the research will expose both individuals to biochemical, genetic and genomic techniques. Training in proteomics, flow cytometry and microscopy will be provided. Scientific communication skills will be fostered by presenting the research at seminars, conferences, and to the public. Appropriate training will be provided by science outreach programmes, at a Genetics Society Workshop on 'Communicating Your Science' and through the UF Career Resource Centre. Training for the researcher and student will be coupled with effective careers advice so that the benefits to the UK and USA can be maximized.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Florida</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Microbiology and Cell Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>NSF Grant on Regulatory Systems that Integrate DNA Replication, Recombination and Protein Modification</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACD3F0CF-AEE2-4E40-8E06-4C23DE90E4F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet (too early).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c27e3977d614.56965201-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Julie Maupin-Furlow leads an internationally recognized research team in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science at the University of Florida.

Replication is prone to stalling at DNA lesions and to avoid reinitiating from origins, stalled forks are restarted by homologous recombination. Ubiquitin-like modification plays a key role in regulating the restart of DNA replication. Recent work in haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii implicated an evolutionary conserved gene neighbourhood centered on RcrA , which is thought to act at stalled replication forks, connecting the processes of DNA replication, recombination and ubiquitin-like protein modification. The project aims to understand how DNA replication fork restart by homologous recombination is modulated by ubiquitin-like protein modification. Haloferax volcanii has a range of genetic tools available and has been shown to use homologous recombination alone in the absence of replication origins, providing a unique system to study homologous recombination-dependent restart of replication forks.

What is the role of Cdc48a during the restart of a stalled replication fork?
Cdc48a is an ATPase linked to protein degradation believed to act at stalled replication forks, using sampylation to modulate remodelling and degradation of fork-associated proteins by the proteasome. The growth rate of cdc48a is slower than that of wild type with a generation time of 5 hours and 3 hours respectively. In order to study the ability of cdc48a strain to survive following treatment with DNA-damaging agents, cells were treated with either UV-irradiation or inter-strand DNA crosslinking agent (MMC). Mutant cells show a growth defect and a significant decrease in survival compared to wild type after DNA damage. These results indicate that Cdc48a is a key protein during the DNA damage response, probably promoting the disassembly of the proteins present at the replication fork via ubiquitin-like modification before the recruitment of the DNA repair proteins to the site of damage.

2. Analysis of in vivo and in vitro protein:protein and protein:DNA interactions. 
What is the role of RcrA in DNA replication and recombination?
RcrA is a CBS domain protein that co-purifies with proteins involved in DNA replication and homologous recombination, including RadA and RadB. We have created three different overexpression vectors containing tagged versions of RadA, RadB and RcrA under the control of the tryptophanase promoter. The interaction observed in vivo between these proteins should be confirmed in vitro. For that purpose, we will purify tagged versions of RadA, RadB and RcrA and their interaction will be assayed by microscale thermopheresis (MST). These experiments will be also carried out in the presence of ssDNA and hrp, the histidine-rich protein found only in archaea located in the rcrA gene neighbourhood.
We have created a strain that express 5&amp;acute;His and 3&amp;acute;StrepII tagged rcrA gene at wild type expression levels under the control of the native promoter (integrated on the H. volcanii chromosome). Pulldown assay will be performed followed by Mass Spectometry to characterize the proteins that interacts with RcrA in vivo. Our aim is to identify new interactors of RcrA in order to elucidate the role and the molecular mechanism RcrA is playing at stalled replication forks.
Is DlnA a Holliday junction resolvase?
DlnA is an RHaseH-like endonuclease member of the YqgF-family of resolvases. To study if DlnA has Mus81-like nicking activity, an essential activity for the conversion of recombination intermediates into replication forks, we purified 5'His and 3'StrepII tagged DlnA and created a wide range of duplex DNA structures2. DlnA:DNA interaction will be assayed by MST.

3.Transcriptional response to DNA damage and replication stress.
We will examine the transcriptional response of the generated H. volcanii mutants. Transcriptional responses will be determined and compared to a wild type strain by RNA-seq. Wild type and mutant strains will be challenged with different DNA damaging agents.
