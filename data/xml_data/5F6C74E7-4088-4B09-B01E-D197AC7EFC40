Over the next decade, European jurisdictions will face new legal and regulatory challenges. The increasing production and use of what can broadly be categorised as 'human enhancement technologies' is creating challenges for the existing legal frameworks in Europe. Examples of these new technologies include pharmacological substances that improve cognition, chemical enhancement in embryo development and hormonal techniques for increasing physical strength. These and similar technologies are not easily accommodated by current laws within European countries and EU-wide regulatory instruments. The use of these technologies has implications in many legal contexts, particularly the regulation of use by professionals such as pilots and medical practitioners. These technologies will (at a theoretical level) re-engage and challenge lawyers in questions of human rights and political responsibility, as well as (at a practical level) necessitate new or amended approaches to the regulation of pharmaceuticals and other such technologies. Given the potential cross-border impacts (e.g. pilots, drivers), there is a strong need for collaboration across jurisdictions. Whilst the network envisaged in this proposal will be composed principally of European scholars, representatives from the United States and Australia will also be included. The Investigators also hope that this will pave the way for further international expansion of the network beyond the 18-month period planned for in this proposal. 

In addition to the academic community, the potential beneficiaries of the research conducted through the proposed Research Network will primarily be policy-makers and professionals within the public and private sectors. Further beneficiaries within industry and the general public are envisaged. With these beneficiaries in mind, the anticipated outputs of the proposed research are principally: 
1) Audience-tailored reports on the outcomes of the workshop outlining:
 a. The potential problems raised by new enhancement technologies
 b. The current legal position relating to enhancement technologies in each jurisdiction and across the EU
 c. Possibilities for regulation (in particular, for example, in relation to the use of technologies by professionals)
The reports will be tailored to particular governmental departments and regulatory bodies, focusing on the main types of technology and groups in society for which they are responsible. They will also be tailored to comment on any particular issues raised by the departments and bodies in response to correspondence from us inviting engagement, sent in the early stages of the research. The reports for the identified groups of professionals will be tailored to their particular professions and refer in general, anonymous terms to the opinion information gathered from members of that professional group. 
2) An edited collection of papers from network participants, expanding on the points above and also exploring the conceptual questions posed for the law. It is envisaged that some of these papers will be produced collaboratively, as a result of links and discussions prompted by the network.
3) An enduring network of legal scholars and practitioners which will be maintained via regular contact and on-going collaboration (potentially promoted via a website).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Other than the academic community, the potential beneficiaries of the research conducted through the proposed Research Network will primarily be policy-makers and professionals within the public and private sectors. Further beneficiaries within industry and the general public are envisaged. 

The proposed research has the potential to significantly influence public policy and legislation, both at a national and an international level. The network will provide a valuable and new opportunity for the sharing of information across the identified boundaries and for conducting pre-emptive legal analysis based on this information. This is the sort of research that can usefully feed directly into the policymaking process. This being so, UK and EU governmental departments and regulatory bodies will be informed of the research, invited to pose questions and will receive tailored reports. 

Valorization groups of surgeons, soldiers and pilots will be the other primary beneficiaries. Having already expressed interest in the Principal Investigator's research activity, they will be invited to provide anecdotal reports of professional uses of enhancement technologies, which will feed into the Network's research activity. These groups will also receive detailed feedback towards the end of the 18-month period, tailored to their particular contexts. 

The research outputs will be of interest to, and could possibly have an impact on, the sectors of industry that develop and produce enhancement technologies. These potential beneficiaries will be interested to know how the legal systems of various countries will be likely to respond to the technologies they develop. They might take this information into account when planning their research and development programmes. Even without such direct impact, the research might affect them indirectly through the policy it has the potential to inform. 

Finally, members of the general public are also likely to be indirect beneficiaries. Where regulation is primarily restrictive, it is assumed that this will be for reasons that aim to protect society from dangerous or untested technology. Where regulation is permissive or even supportive, it is assumed that this will be for reasons that aim to improve people's lives; through improvements to health, through increasing opportunities, or through the enhancement of individuals' general well-being and fulfillment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36168</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Media Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F3F3DF3-6074-44CF-8FFE-65DB9E736062</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Network has established a successful Twitter account (@neurolawnetwork) with over 350 followers as well as a Facebook page.

The Conference aimed to identify the legal issues that arise as a result of these developments in human enhancement technologies. Paper presentations and panel sessions were directed at exploring the ways in which legal systems - both within jurisdictions and across borders - can and should respond to these the important emerging issues. These have focused in particular on a range of issues, including:

- criminal responsibility, 
- the regulation of enhancement technologies
- issues arising from CRISPR-Cas and genetic enhancement
- whether there could be obligations to enhance, 
- enhancement and public health, including radical life extension
- human rights
- the associated harms that are often overlooked or only vaguely dealt with relating to enhancement. 

A number of collaborations have started through the Network including work between Nick Fitz (University of British Columbia) Nick Davis (Manchester Met University) and Janet Bultitude (University of Bath). The conference is due to result in a special edition of the Journal of Law, Information and Science (forthcoming, 2016) as well as papers presented at the conference being published in the Oxford Journal of Bioethics. The Network has engaged with academics and members of the public through our website and twitter feed @NeuroLawNetwork.

Topic 1: Virtual reality technologies and technologies allowing remote control of robotic devices pose new challenges for concepts of harm in relation to personal identity, and for questions of responsibility for actions. On a related note, considered the way that interactions via avatars change the nature of human interactions and the potential for fraud, mistaken identity, assault, property rights, etc. 

Topic 2: Considered the relationship between a failure to enhance and harm, and the legal difficulties in establishing causation in this scenario. It was argued that there was no legal duty for professionals to take drugs to reduce fatigue, but that, since some argue that there is, establishing causation in such a scenario would be problematic. Agreed that a paper to follow up on the question of fatigue and causation would be beneficial. 

Topic 3: Enhancement technologies pose questions for employment rights, discrimination against those not enhancing and potential requirements to enhance. Could fall foul of EU anti-discrimination law, and concerns about coercing into enhancement. 

Topic 4: Considered the terminology in relation to enhancement and whether it is helpful. 

Topic 5: Considered the relationship between enhancement technology and the right to bodily integrity.

Agreed topics for further workshops: regulation at present and in future, human rights implications, definition of enhancement, industry professionals and the challenges they face.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458ff522a9957.06321511</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article for Vice Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A9D2462-680D-4ED9-95A7-7598D0495230</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our conference partnered with Luke Robert Mason, director of Humanity Plus and writer for Vice Online.

These have been numerous, as many participants presented interesting views and raised useful questions. At the completion of the project we will synthesise these into a report. At this stage, we report on the major points raised and discussed at the workshops:
? Virtual reality technologies and technologies allowing remote control of robotic devices pose new challenges for concepts of harm in relation to personal identity, and for questions of responsibility for actions. 
o Discussed whether laws could effectively regulate robotics issues in the same manner as issues concerned with animals, given that the nature of control is more direct. 
o Recognised that developments in Artificial Intelligence would be relevant to the question of control, and therefore the issue of responsibility. 
o Considered the way that interactions via avatars change the nature of human interactions and the potential for fraud, mistaken identity, etc. Also whether assaulting or harassing a robotic avatar would constitute assault or harassment of the controller, and whether harm to the avatar would be property damage or harm to the person. 
o Questioned who would be responsible for faulty robotics in terms of product liability. 
? Considered the relationship between a failure to enhance and harm, and the legal difficulties in establishing causation in this scenario. 
o It was argued that there was no legal duty for professionals to take drugs to reduce fatigue, but that, since some argue that there is, establishing causation in such a scenario would be problematic. 
o Agreed that a paper to follow up on the question of fatigue and causation would be beneficial. 
? Enhancement technologies pose questions for employment rights, discrimination against those not enhancing and potential requirements to enhance.
o Could fall foul of EU anti-discrimination law, and concerns about coercing into enhancement
o Increasing use of robots in, eg medical context, raised concern that robots would replace human operators, creating increased pressure to enhance and raising the question of whether the choice is between mechanisation or enhancement of humans. 
o Considered that there might be a right not to have technology imposed on you, and decided that there is a liberty to opt out, rather than a right
o Considered potential for discrimination against enhanced people, why this would occur and whether it would be an issue
? Considered whether &amp;quot;enhancement&amp;quot; is an appropriately neutral terminology 
? Considered the relationship between enhancement technology and the right to bodily integrity
o Enhancements would not bring a person within discrimination laws, but a person with a prostheses would: important legal distinction
o Issue of integration of the technology with the person's body: prostheses and bodily integrity vs property damage
o Privacy issues posed by ability to stimulate brain, etc
o Both ECHR and disability law might be relevant
? Considered what was meant by &amp;quot;enhancement&amp;quot;, and whether a set definition could be found, or would be useful. Addressed the following conceptual issues:
o Noted that baseline expectations change over time, whilst &amp;quot;enhancement&amp;quot; expectations vary between the public and professionals
o Distinction between enhancement and treatment
o Cognitive vs moral enhancement, and a deceptive focus on pharmaceutical enhancement
o Amenability to regulation and current medical status of enhancements, the difference between prohibition and regulation, and the need for regulation
o Societal fears in relation to unknown technologies, varying access to them
? Considered social approaches to control vs biological approaches and concluded that they were not morally equivalent
o Regulation could be of substances, via professional licensing or self-reporting, or via research review, as well as via product liability or criminalization
? Examined how tDCS works, and what its potential as an enhancement might be
o Noted that there can be off-target effects where stimulation of other parts of the brain occurs, and that there can be other minor side effects
o Recognised that the enhancement offered may be very small in lab conditions, as opposed to the greater enhancement expected by the public, and that some cognitive facilities are more amenable to enhancement in this way
o Concerns expressed about safety perceptions, unintended effects, and long term impact
o Proposed an inclusive online community offering accurate information to the public to promote safe use whilst regulation is still pending
? Considered cross-jurisdictional issues, noting increased prescription of &amp;quot;enhancing&amp;quot; drugs like Ritalin and that different jurisdictions have dealt with this more or less conservatively
? Discussed the potential of genetic enhancement technology and the unknown risks it poses
? Considered human rights implications from enhancement technology
o Considered that human rights conceptions might need to be adjusted if enhancement changes the position of those using it
o Considered the possibility of a right to enhance, with an inclination to reject this idea
o Discussed offenders and biomedical interventions, the problem of valid consent, and bodily integrity
? Looked at regulation of enhancement
o Noted potential liabilities of physicians prescribing enhancement drugs at present
o Rejected the feasibility of a duty to enhance for professionals due to difficulty in establishing legal causation

In addition, the Conference has culminated in a number of key findings including:

- how enhancement technology may have consequences in terms of the standards of criminal responsibility
- how the regulation of enhancement technologies should proceed, including novel ideas that make links to the regulation of foods
- issues arising from CRISPR-Cas and genetic enhancement and whether there ought to be a continued moratorium on germ-line editing
- whether there could be obligations to enhance, in the workplace such as surgeons and pilots and in the law, including for witnesses and jurors
- How enhancements at work relate to the mental and physical health of employees
- How human enhancement and public health fit together and whether there are rights to radical life extension
