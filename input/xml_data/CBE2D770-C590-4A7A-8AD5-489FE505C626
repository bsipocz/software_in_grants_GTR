Construction</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I002596/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The most prominent archaeological features of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) are the colossal stone statues (moai) dating to c. AD 1000 to AD 1600 that once stood on stone ceremonial platforms (ahu) positioned around the coastline of the island. The project aims to develop new interpretations on the organisation and meaning of these monumental construction activities and to unify the hitherto isolated research foci - of statue quarries, statue transport roads, and ahu, into an integrated Island-wide programme of landscape study, survey and excavation.\n\nExtant moai research focuses upon the socio-economic significance of monument production, particularly the pragmatics of competing access to resources, and the mechanics of how moai were transported to the ahu. Our project offers a different perspective by investigating construction as being socially-articulated, taking place at ideologically meaningful places, with the activities being as important as the final product. The fieldwork integrates five prospecting elements: i) Landscape Survey of ahu, statue roads and statue quarries including detailed topographic mapping; ii) mapping of the audio-visual qualities of locations; iii) Geophysical and deep-ground penetrating radar prospecting to locate buried quarry workings and obscured statue transport roads and associated features; iv) Laser scanning of quarry surfaces; and v) excavation of quarry floors and spoil.\n\nRapa Nui is at a fragile moment in its socio-cultural history. The island has a World Heritage status and tourism is rapidly growing with weekly air flights from Santiago and Tahiti. Concurrently, the Chilean Government is in the process of returning land, all of which is dense with archaeology, to the indigenous population. The majority of Rapa Nui's monumental archaeology is deteriorating from salt damage and the vulnerability of the island's archaeology is compounded by a lack of coordinated island-wide databases or co-operative research.\n\nOur aims are:\n1. To date the chronology of statue quarrying, and compare it with known construction chronologies of the ahu .The longevity of Rapa Nui's statue production is a focus of debate. Our excavations aim to date key phases of the pre-eminent statue quarry of Rano Raraku, and of Puna Pau - the quarry for the large red 'hats' (pukao) that adorned the moai on the ahu. Rano Raraku is the only quarry to have had any excavation - by Heyerdahl's team in the 1950s, but the resulting radiocarbon dates are not refined enough to be useful. No absolute chronology exists for the use of pukao.\n2. To explore the social organisation of Rapa Nui's monumental construction, particularly the organisation of quarrying. Visual inspection suggests that the Rano Raraku quarries were divided into distinct clusters of working units. We will investigate this through surface survey and geotechnical survey (see iiii) above).\n3.To better understand the relationships between the landscape locations of statue quarrying, statue transport and ahu with statues. Work at the ahu has either been linked to reconstruction and conservation, or to characterising architectural components and their sequences. Our work instead focuses on them as landscape places and aims to characterise their topographic positions - together with the evidence from environmental reconstruction, and to elucidate their possible intervisibility and inter-audibility with quarries and roads.\n4. For the processes and results of our work to transcend single methodological and academic traditions of the interpretation and public understandings of Rapa Nui's archaeology, and in doing so to aid broadly-informed management of the Rapanuian landscape and support Rapanuians in the self-determination of their own heritage. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project collaborates with the Island's museum (MAPSE) and Chilean National Parks Authority Rapa Nui (CONAF) in documenting, interpreting, presenting and conserving Rapa Nui's heritage. It will enhance the provision of heritage information for Rapanuians and provide Rapanuians with knowledge and skills to manage and interpret their heritage independently of foreign agendas. Areas in which our work will impact are:\n\nNational Government Policies\nThe Chilean government has recently begun returning land to Rapanuian residents, implemented through the Island's land development commission. Our survey records of the densities of prehistoric sites on the landscape will be given to the commission to assist in land management decisions and the distribution of land parcels to lesser archaeologically sensitive areas. \n\nLocal Identity/Self-determination\nOur research contributes to an integrated understanding of the Island's prehistory. It will promote awareness of Island identity through enhancing heritage databases and providing accessible information - for Rapanuians, non-Rapanuian residents and visitors by:\ni) Our databases being freely accessible. They will be input into MAPSE's public-access databases and added to the Rapa Nui Archaeological Database: http://www.rapanuidatabase.org/, as well as being placed with ADS in the UK\nii) A Rapa Nui-Spanish-English MAPSE exhibition of our findings (Year 4) and notice board displays and pamphlets in preceding years \niii) Adding to MAPSE's collections major cultural objects discovered during surface survey/excavation \niv) Trilingual on-site information boards and on-site talks \nv) Public lectures and presentations to the Island's bodies.\n\nSkills Transfer\nWe will employ Rapanuians on our fieldwork and provide training in mapping, survey, excavation, environmental sampling, and finds processing. We will train CONAF park rangers in laser scanning and geophysical survey and the utilisation of these technologies and their datasets for conservation.\n\nRapanuian Youth\nOur fieldwork will support the training of local students in Rapa Nui's archaeology and aid the development of generic skills- mapping, and computing/technical. We will do this by: \ni) Providing Rapa Nui-Spanish school powerpoint packs explaining our work and its context\nii) Hosting school visits to the excavations\niii) Working with the 'A P&amp;oacute; Rapa Nui Youth Involvement Program (http://www.chauvet-translation.com/apo.htm) to equip the Island's high school students to be an integral part of the documentation, study and conservation of their island's past. Our project co-director, Francisco Torres is a co-director of this programme.\n\nHeritage Management and Conservation \nIt is more than ten years since Rapa Nui was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage list of cultural sites, but its management plans are still under discussion. We are working with CONAF on the development of management plans for Puna Pau and Rano Raraku. Our work at the quarries will provide focal points for tourist tours and aid CONAF's current initiatives to create new information boards and position tourist walkways to minimise site damage.\nWe will assist CONAF in using our laser scanning equipment to document and monitor sun and salt erosion and deterioration to quarry surfaces, statue hats and the Orongo ceremonial village. In particular we will provide high precision laser documentation of the petroglyphs of the sacred precinct at Mata Ngarau, Orongo. Mata Ngarau is located at the top of precipitous sea cliffs, which are under of threat of imminent collapse. Although sections of these petroglyphs and the associated houses of Orongo have been scanned by commercial companies they have never been fully digitally documented. \n\nCultural Tourism\nOver 50,000 tourists visit Rapa Nui each year.

(LOC: Jane Downes, Alison Keir, Colin Richards &amp;amp; Kate Welham) 

The 'My Place Our Heritage' education programme was established in January 2014 by Francisco Torres Hochstetter (Museo Antropol&amp;oacute;gico P.Sebasti&amp;aacute;n Englert (MAPSE) and Paulina Jerez Torres (Secretar&amp;iacute;a T&amp;eacute;cnica de Patrimonio Rapa Nui (STP), with LOC: Jane Downes, Alison Keir (University of the Highlands and Islands), Kate Welham (University of Bournemouth) and Colin Richards (University of Manchester). The collaborative initiative was born out of archaeological outreach activities in Rapa Nui undertaken as part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded Landscapes of Construction Project (LOC) in January 2014.
Shared issues and connectivity were identified between the Rapa Nui and the Orkney islands' communities needs in terms of education, training and capacity building, seen as necessary to underpin sustainable heritage management. The ensuing heritage education programme was initiated through a mutual desire to establish continuity and sustainability in heritage education for school children in Rapa Nui, and in Orkney.The future aims of the joint initiative are to establish virtual contact between school pupils and an exchange of findings and experiences, to lead to exchange visits. The concept of linking two island communities through schools' heritage education was felt to have wider benefits of cultural exchanged there was a shared desire to have the role of archaeology and cultural heritage education better articulated with Learning for Sustainability (or Education for Sustainability).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rapa Nui National Park</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Contributing to Heritage Plan for The Rapa Nui World Heritage Landscape (Plan del Patrimonio Rapa Nui).</gtr:description><gtr:id>15D5D63E-D2C4-441D-BAEC-428DF22D4EFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is still in an early stage.

The collaborative initiative was born out of archaeological outreach activities in Rapa Nui undertaken as part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded Landscapes of Construction Project (LOC) in January 2014.
Shared issues and connectivity were identified between the Rapa Nui and the Orkney islands' communities needs in terms of education, training and capacity building, seen as necessary to underpin sustainable heritage management. The ensuing heritage education programme was initiated through a mutual desire to establish continuity and sustainability in heritage education for school children in Rapa Nui, and in Orkney.The future aims of the joint initiative are to establish virtual contact between school pupils and an exchange of findings and experiences, to lead to exchange visits. The concept of linking two island communities through schools' heritage education was felt to have wider benefits of cultural exchanged there was a shared desire to have the role of archaeology and cultural heritage education better articulated with Learning for Sustainability (or Education for Sustainability).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Forest Corporation (CONAF)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>2015 Survey of the Archaeological and Erosional Environment of of the Poike Peninsula, Rapa Nui</gtr:description><gtr:id>7076CDD8-FE49-4256-92B6-5A304095CE8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advisory documents.

Impacts: World media coverage - Times Newspaper supplement 2012 and international newspaper, radio and BBC coverage. New information boards and displays at Puna Pau. National Park guides and local tourist guides trained to disseminate the new information.

2) Findings: The routes, and the distribution and types of archaeological features associated with, and in the vicinity of, the moai (statue) roads, leading to and from the Rano Raraku statues quarries. Impacts: international media coverage, request to work with National Parks Authority (CONAF) Rapa Nui in creating a National Park Heritage Trail along the statue roads.

3) Findings: First detailing of the characteristics of monumental eye petroglyphs at Rano Raraku statue quarry and Puna Pau, including previously unknown/not recorded examples. Request from CONAF Rapa Nui to train park rangers in recording quarry petroglyphs and monitoring their fragile state of preservation. These petroglyphs are now mentioned on site tours by park guides and tourist guides and change interpretations of quarrying from a solely practical activity to one that had ideological associations.

4) Findings: Evidence that the recumbent statues (moai) along many of the statue roads were not abandoned in transport but were originally standing monuments along the roads. This work is ongoing but will impact on traditional views of the so-called collapse of Rapa Nui statue-building societies.

5) Findings: New evidence for numerous quarries associated with the construction of ahu (the ceremonial platforms on which the statues were placed) and new evidence for the regular presence of 'canoe' ramps associated with the ahu. Impacts: these databases of threatened unmapped sites which are key to the totality of understanding Rapa Nui's landscape-scale heritage, have been digitally filed with CONAF Rapa Nui for incorporation into the its listing of archaeologically sensitive landscapes and will aid the identification by the Chilean government of viable areas for land return to indigenous Rapanui.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CCF3C544-09C7-40D8-96C1-4F87BD0CBC3B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54626c7eeb3970.84182892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) LOC had recovered the first dates and evidence of quarrying techniques, tools and activities and new evidence for prehistoric roads at Puna Pau, the quarry for the famous statue hats that adorn the Rapa Nui (Easter Island) statues. 

2) Identification and detailing of the routes of the moai (statue) roads, leading to and from the Rano Raraku statue quarries, and of the distribution and types of archaeological features associated with, and in the wider landscape around them.

3) The first detailing of the characteristics of monumental eye petroglyphs and their quarry contexts at Rano Raraku statue quarry and Puna Pau, including many previously unknown/not recorded examples. 

4) Evidence that the recumbent statues (moai) along the statue roads were not abandoned in transport (which is the traditional interpretation), but were originally standing monuments along the roads (achieved through LOC's use of geophysical prospecting and monitoring of the weathering characteristics of the statues). 

5) The identification of numerous quarries associated with the construction of ahu (the ceremonial platforms on which the statues were placed).

6) Identification of the regular presence of 'canoe' ramps associated with the ahu, suggesting the importance of these monuments in linking land and sea, and overseeing routes between the two. 

7). A greater understanding of the associated domestic archaeology of ahu. This includes prehistoric domestic architecture, numerous stone quarries and agricultural features extending up to 2km inland from the coastal ahu. LOC has identified and mapped the settlement archaeology associated with more than 30 ahu on a landscape scale. This allows a better understanding of the spatial articulation of Rapa Nui societies at the time of statue construction.

8). Approximately 100 hare paenga - boat-shaped houses - have been surveyed in detail to isolate their use and construction sequences and the diverse origins of the stones used in their construction. This provides a greater understanding of the use and conceptualisation of stone as a material of construction on Rapa Nui beyond the traditional focus by the public and academia on its monumental use for statues.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Previous archaeological work on Rapa Nui has been disjointed and has not considered the archaeology of the societies that constructed the statues (moai) as an inter-related whole. By contrast, the links so far made by LOC between the moai and the moai topknot quarries, the 'moai roads', ahu, and the wider industrial, domestic and ritual landscape of the Island are new and evidence the essential role of construction activities in the belief systems and organisation of Rapa Nui prehistoric society. We have done this by combining a landscape scale of study with multiple methods and scales of science-based and sensory fieldwork. This combination is both new for Rapa Nui but also for the archaeology of Oceania generally and has potential to be developed in other Pacific island contexts. LOC's findings provide the academic foundations of linking Rapa Nui's archaeology to a wider Polynesian context, and this could be further explored for Rapa Nui's prehistoric art, and domestic architecture, as well as its traditions of monumentality and stone use. Rapa Nui has long had an iconic status of exemplifying social collapse through overuse of resources and a consequential cessation of monument construction. More thematically, in terms of understanding the emergence and collapse of civilisations and their associated traditions of monumentality, LOC's work shifts this simplistic focus on monumental statues to a society that had a sophisticated relationship with the use of stone resources at a domestic and agricultural scale. This provides an alternative perspective for the future exploration comparative regional scenarios of how societies utilize construction activities rather than monumentality to express ideologies and aspects of social coherence. For Rapa Nui today, the bigger interpretative picture that our work elucidates, broadens the active role of archaeological data to different Island stakeholders. CONAF for example has already started to use LOC's findings in heritage conservation and presentation. It is of ongoing value in land return in isolating complexes of archeological features, rather than individual monuments, for preservation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>17B9DDB0-9097-4EE0-A8A2-5CCC23F7CA57</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54626d50109640.22587735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Recording and analysis of weathering on recumbent moai situated along the southern Ara Moai (Moai Road) between Rano Raraku and Ahu Hoa Anga Vaka A Tua Poi, Rapa Nui.
