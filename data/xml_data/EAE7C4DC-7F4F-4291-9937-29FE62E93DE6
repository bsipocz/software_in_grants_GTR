In human, for example, it is estimated that about one billion nerve cells form more than one quadrillion specific connections. During development of the neuronal network, nerve fibres must follow the defined pathways and project to the correct targets. In this process, nerve fibres are guided by external molecular cues derived from their pathways and targets. Guidance cues are recognized by nerve fibres through specific 'receptors'. Therefore, studies on the interaction between guidance molecules and their receptors are a key to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of brain development. The proposed research focuses on a protein called Nel. Although Nel exists in the developing nervous system and has structural features that are found in other molecules that play important biological functions, little is known about its functions in development of the nervous system. In addition, the receptor(s) for Nel has not been identified. Our preliminary studies have already indicated that Nel is a novel axon guidance cue in the visual system. In the proposed research, we will analyze the functions of Nel in development of the visual system and identify its receptor. We expect that the proposed research will reveal the function of Nel in neuronal network formation and the molecular mechanism by which Nel controls behaviour of nerve fibres. In addition, results from this project will have major clinical implications for strategies aimed at neuronal regeneration after brain and spinal cord injuries and for treatment of birth defects affecting the nervous system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed research focuses on Nel, which is an extracellular glycoprotein that contains six epidermal growth factor like domains. In this proposal, we will investigate the functions of Nel in the developing visual system and identify its cognate receptors. We propose the following four aims. Aim I: In vivo functions of Nel in the retinotectal projection. Functions of Nel in the developing chicken visual system will be tested directly in vivo. We will focus on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon guidance within the retina and in the tectum. We will take both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. In gain-of-function experiments, Nel will be overexpressed in the retina/tectum by using in ovo electroporation. Loss-of-function experiments will utilize knockdown using short-hairpin RNA for Nel. Then effects on RGC axons guidance will be examined by axon tracing. Aim II: Functions of Nel in the regulation of in vitro RGC axon behaviour. We will examine effects of Nel on several different aspects of axon behaviour in established in vitro assays. We will perform stripe assays and growth cone steering assays. Aim III: Structure-function analyses of Nel binding to RGC axons and Nel-induced axon outgrowth inhibition and growth cone collapse. This aim will determine the domain(s) of Nel that is essential for binding to RGC axons end exerting its effects on axon behaviour. We will make a series of deletion mutants of Nel that lack specific domain(s) of the protein and fuse them to an alkaline phosphatase (AP) tag. Then, the mutant Nel-AP fusions will be tested in binding assays and axon behaviour assays. Aim IV: Identification of the Nel receptor(s). We will identify the cognate receptor(s) for Nel in this aim. To do this, we will screen expression libraries by affinity probe in situ approach using Nel-AP. After receptor cloning, we will characterize the receptor-ligand interaction.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>563403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Friends of Anchor Pilot Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Friends of ANCHOR</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>37CEEBB4-437C-4285-8863-5BF1441EF602</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58be1631796d13.94526795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Friends of Anchor Pilot Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Friends of ANCHOR</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F718F8F3-071E-49B2-8EBB-03C7F590A425</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c3381539c3.71242504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49530</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Bowel &amp;amp; Cancer Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Bowel &amp; Cancer Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D70D5700-890E-4F7E-B8BB-CABA10F52746</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58be16d6d477d1.25350740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>12000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>NHS Grampian Endowment Fund</gtr:department><gtr:description>NHS Grampian Endowment Fund Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>NHS Grampian</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>95B1AE3B-10CC-45F2-AD7D-35B73BD9AC45</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c45bbdc787.15471772</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The broad goal of the proposed research is to improve knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of cell-cell interaction during development. The direct objective of this proposal is to elucidate the function and signalling mechanisms of Nel (Neural epidermal growth factor-like). Nel is a multimeric, multimodular extracellular glycoprotein with heparin-binding activity and structural similarities to thrombospondin-1. Although Nel is strongly expressed in the developing nervous system, its functions in neural development are largely unknown. The project specifically investigates the functions of Nel in chicken retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon guidance and retinotectal projection.



In the original grant application, we proposed the following four specific Aims. 

Aim I: In vivo functions of Nel in the chicken retinotectal projection.

Aim II: Functions of Nel in the regulation of in vitro RGC axon behaviour.

Aim III: Structure-function analyses of Nel binding to RGC axons and Nel-induced axon outgrowth inhibition and growth cone collapse.

Aim IV: Identification of the Nel receptor(s).



As described below, we have made significant progress in those aims. Key findings obtained from each aim of this grant are summarised below.



Aim I: In vivo functions of Nel in the retinotectal projection.

To study the functions of Nel directly in vivo, we have taken two complementary approaches: gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. In gain-of-function experiments, we have overexpressed Nel in the developing chick visual system, and examined its effects on RGC axon projection. We have found that ectopic expression of Nel causes repulsion of RGC axons in vivo and disrupts the retinotectal projection. This result indicates that Nel can act as an inhibitory guidance cue for retinal axons in vivo.



As a loss-of-function approach, we have developed a novel system that allows transposon-mediated introduction of artificial miRNA into chick embryos. We have confirmed that this system can efficiently knock down expression of Nel in the developing visual system. We believe that this new system provides a stable and efficient loss-of-function option and can contribute to the analysis of gene functions during chick development. By using this system, our studies have detected defects in visual projection caused by knockdown of Nel expression. One paper has been submitted and another manuscript is currently in preparation for publication of these results.



Aim II: Functions of Nel in the regulation of in vitro RGC axon behaviour.

In this aim, we have determined the function of Nel in regulation of chick RGC axon behaviour in vitro. Whereas the receptor for Nel has not yet been identified, Nel-binding activity was detected in RGC axons, suggesting that RGC axons express a receptor for Nel. We examined the effects of Nel on RGC axon behaviour in in vitro axon guidance assays. In axon outgrowth assays, we have found that Nel significantly inhibits RGC axon outgrowth. This inhibition was a specific effect, because outgrowth of olfactory axons, which do not show significant Nel binding activity, was not affected by Nel. In growth cone collapse assays, we have found that Nel induces growth cone collapse in RGC axons in a dose dependent manner. Those results have been published in Mol. Cell Neurosci. (Jiang, Y. et al. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 41, 113 (2009)).



Aim III: Structure-function analyses of Nel binding to RGC axons and Nel-induced axon outgrowth inhibition and growth cone collapse. 

The Nel protein contains an N-terminal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-N) domain, five cysteine rich domains, and six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. However, little is known about the functions of specific domains of the Nel protein. In this aim, we have performed structure-function analysis of Nel, by using a series of expression constructs for different regions of the Nel protein. We have demonstrated that the TSP-N domain is responsible for homo-multimer formation of Nel and its heparin-binding activity. When Nel and related Nell1 are expressed in the same cells in vitro, they can form hetero-multimers through the TSP-N domain. This interaction is specific, because Nel or Nell1 do not hetero-oligomerise with thrombospondin-1. Interestingly, Nel and Nell1 are expressed in several regions of the mouse central nervous system with partly overlapping patterns, suggesting the possibility that Nel-Nell1 hetero-oligomers exist and function in vivo. Whereas both the TSP-N domain and cysteine rich domains can bind to retinal axons in vivo, only the latter causes growth cone collapse in cultured retinal axons, suggesting that cysteine rich domains interact with and activate an inhibitory axon guidance receptor. These results suggest that Nel interacts with a range of molecules through its different domains and exerts distinct functions. Those results have been published on line and are currently in press by J. Biol. Chem. (Nakamura, R. et al. J. Biol. Chem. (2011), in press).



Aim IV: Identification of the Nel receptor(s).

We have been taking an expression cloning approach to identify the cognate receptors for Nel. We have constructed expression cDNA libraries from embryonic chick brains, and screened them by using a Nel protein fused to an alkaline phosphatase tag as a probe. Prof. John Flanagan (Harvard Medical School, USA), who has developed this methodology and has extensive experience with receptor/ligand identification using this technique, has been providing us with advice. We have obtained several candidate clones from those screenings, and are currently characterising them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The proposed project will provide essential information for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of vertebrate neuronal network formation, but will also have major implications for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving neuronal regeneration following brain and spinal cord lesions. We have disseminated our findings to clinician-scientists and the commercial sector in the following ways, and will continue those activities.



- First, we have presented our results at international conferences that are attended by both basic researchers and clinicians. 



- Second, we will actively seek opportunities of collaborations with clinicians to explore the potential clinical applications of the proposed research. 



- Third, if the project reveals novel signalling pathways that are involved in Nel/Nell2-mediated axon inhibition, we will initiate a collaboration to set up a screen for small molecules that antagonise those pathways. We will obtain assistance from the Kosterlitz Centre for Therapeutics at the University of Aberdeen (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/kosterlits/), an organisation that provides links between academics, industrial partners and the business sector, including assistance in pursuing translational and commercial opportunities. We will also work with the Research and Innovation Department (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/research-innovation/) and Business Development Team at the University of Aberdeen to facilitate the exploitation and application of the proposed research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>54C4B8EE-1541-4821-A094-B16849EA54D1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6267752914.007523777224ac</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Deletion mutant constructs of Nel</gtr:description><gtr:id>7479E0B5-B886-472D-AAF8-A84F85626581</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These constructs would be useful for identifying molecular mechanisms of Nel signal transduction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545d4715ebcbc3.98361815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Nel expression constructs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Construct for synthesizing a Nel RNA probe.</gtr:description><gtr:id>426ED72A-8635-4F53-B3AC-69AA52D8D204</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545d46731bfda2.65787654</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Plasmid construct for a Nel RNA probe</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DCDDE0F-32E3-42E4-97DF-E1DC0442629A</gtr:id><gtr:title>In vitro guidance of retinal axons by a tectal lamina-specific glycoprotein Nel.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and cellular neurosciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f7d6414b5561959e026a21adb7b56753"><gtr:id>f7d6414b5561959e026a21adb7b56753</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jiang Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1044-7431</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545d0701edd0f8.86427676</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE4CFB41-CE6F-41A5-BAE7-9534C464B379</gtr:id><gtr:title>Expression and regulatory effects on cancer cell behavior of NELL1 and NELL2 in human renal cell carcinoma.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cancer science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e6e349f8d07c8cf823af8d5509964a29"><gtr:id>e6e349f8d07c8cf823af8d5509964a29</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nakamura R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1347-9032</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c1f7e7f704.94163101</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CAA1AF4-D921-4D78-AE58-A0AF54A52760</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nel positively regulates the genesis of retinal ganglion cells by promoting their differentiation and survival during development.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology of the cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/438ca9e6208452b54f4beeccb5076f14"><gtr:id>438ca9e6208452b54f4beeccb5076f14</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nakamoto C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1059-1524</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545d0702508a44.81168111</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41B7D7F8-B2D9-4775-B9DF-1743EB21B2BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structure-function analysis of Nel, a thrombospondin-1-like glycoprotein involved in neural development and functions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e6e349f8d07c8cf823af8d5509964a29"><gtr:id>e6e349f8d07c8cf823af8d5509964a29</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nakamura R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545d07022906f9.41251994</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G007632/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
