Supercomputers differ from standard home computers in that they have many thousands of processors instead of just one or two. Supercomputers can therefore perform calculations that would not be practical or possible on a standard computer in your home. These tasks could not be run even on the best laptop or desktop computer available. In some cases, tasks would run but would take years to complete. In others, the task could not be run at all because too much data would need to be held in memory simultaneously. 

Simulations on ARCHER are addressing many of the UK's current challenges within society. Examples include: the development of efficient renewable energy sources to meet the UK's energy and environmental targets; the forecasting of extreme weather events to provide vital early warnings; the design of new drugs and technologies to address current health challenges; the modelling of turbulent flow over vehicles to improve fuel consumption and/or performance; and even simulating how dinosaurs walked. 

One aim of this proposal is to demonstrate these benefits to the general public through a series of outreach activities. A set of exciting and accessible demonstrators will be developed and taken to science festivals across the UK. A resource pack specifically designed for teachers will be developed, as will a set of accessible case studies. 

A second aim is to encourage equality and diversity within the supercomputing community. The project will look to motivate and encourage wider participation in computational science and supercomputing, through teacher resources, on-line resources and tailored events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ARCHER service facilitates high quality science from a broad range of disciplines across EPSRC's and NERC's remits. The outcome is science that generates significant societal impact, improving health and overall quality of life in the UK and beyond. This science influences policy and impacts on the UK's economy. The science on ARCHER covers the spectrum of EPSRC and NERC strategic themes including the digital economy, energy, global uncertainties, healthcare technologies, living with environmental change and engineering. The aim of this proposal is to capture and showcase this impact.

The primary beneficiaries of the impact from ARCHER are:

- The general public, through enhanced quality of life and health;

- Policymakers and stakeholders through improved policy and agendas;

- Secondary school children, undergraduates and early career researchers through enhanced opportunities and improved economic outcomes;

- Society, through the diversification of the HPC talent pool, and the benefits resulting from research and support teams more representative of the society they serve;

- HPC professionals and ARCHER users through improved skills and opportunities leading to economic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>484734</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hands-on Porting and Optimisation Workshop 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A2BFD1C-A3D4-4E61-8EF7-39F36697B5DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop helped new users port their code on to ARCHER, and helped current ARCHER users improve their codes performance and scaling.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0447f0dc7b8.08412803</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://events.prace-ri.eu/event/380/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Big Bang Fair 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE6D974E-FD08-40EB-AA47-E27876C5A98D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ARCHER Outreach again ran a booth at the Big Bang Fair 2017 at the NEC, Birmingham.

Josephine Beech-Brandt 
October 2016

The second ARCHER Champions Workshop took place in Oxford (thanks to OeRC) in September
and was a lunchtime-lunchtime one day meeting, including an evening meal.
There were 25 attendees, 10 of which had attended the first Champions workshop, and 3
bursaries were awarded to cover reasonable travel and accommodation costs.
There was an in-depth look at the eCSE activity, a session on the newly announced KNL system,
and updates from other sites. Time for discussion sessions was included.
Topics Covered:
? HPC Service Provision for the UK
? GPU Provision
? KNL on ARCHER
? ARCHER SAFE Updates and Developments
? Outreach activities using Wee Archie as a focus
? Getting started on ARCHER
? More in-depth look at the eCSE activity
Outcomes:
? Good number of attendees with 10 repeat attendees (expand if possible in future)
? Feedback from the attendees (overall very positive)
? Discussion sessions went well (try to include more in future, one each half session)
? Champions making use of ARCHER Champions Project time 
? Good to get more external contributors and plan to increase for Champions 3
? Look to monitor what Champions are doing
? Opportunity to engage with users and Tier-2 sites
? Slides were all placed on the Champions website
? Slack channel within RSE space was created 
? Use of Champions email for Training and Tier 2 for local dissemination
? Next Champions event with HPC-SIG in Leeds in February with focus on Tier 2 and 
Training</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c69f50ef6fb5.74643516</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/champions/workshops/oxf_sept2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ARCHER Champions Workshop (Leeds)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6200C39C-A7F7-4B91-9C26-15B8A9FC37A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ARCHER Champions Workshop held alongside HPC-SIG.
