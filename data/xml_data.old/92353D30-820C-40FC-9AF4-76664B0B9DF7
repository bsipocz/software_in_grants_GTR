Frequently, contemporary evolution is associated with human activities for example antibiotic resistance in bacteria, metal pollution tolerance in plants, pesticide and herbicide resistance, and changes in fish stocks in response to over-fishing. Understanding how populations adapt to rapid and sustained anthropogenic change is imperative for predicting limits to population persistence, and reducing species extinction rates.

Our traditional view of evolution suggests that adaptation occurs through offspring inheriting genes from their parents that increase their survival and reproduction (fitness) in the current environment. Genetic variation is assumed to arise through random genetic mutations. But since most random mutations decrease an organism's fitness, and even random mutations that increase fitness initially only occur in a single individual, which might fail to breed just by chance, it is hard to see how random mutations alone can explain contemporary evolution in response to rapid anthropogenic change. 

If populations are large enough, an advantageous mutation may already exist in the population that can 'rescue' it from extinction. However, an emerging alternative hypothesis that this study will focus on is that populations initially evolve through a process of non-genetic inheritance, in which novel phenotypes are generated by the transmission of factors other than DNA sequence. 

'Parental effects' arise when parents differentially allocate non-genetic materials to their offspring altering their behaviour, morphology, or physiology. For example, in many species females produce fewer larger offspring when they experience harsh conditions. Alternatively, 'Epigenetic inheritance' occurs when the epigenetic marks responsible for changing the way that DNA is folded in a cell is inherited from one generation to the next, changing the pattern of genes that are switched on or off at any given time. This is essentially the same mechanism that explains how distinct cell types in our bodies are maintained from one cell division to the next.

Currently we have little idea how important non-genetic inheritance is in enabling populations to evolve in response to rapid environmental change, or which mechanism(s) might be involved. This is because in sexually reproducing organisms each individual has its own unique set of genes making it difficult to separate genetic inheritance from non-genetic inheritance and secondly because studies of non-genetic inheritance must be conducted over at least 3 generations, something which is not feasible in many study systems. In this study we will overcome these problems by studying non-genetic inheritance in the water flea, Daphnia pulex; an organism that has a generation time of 10 days and reproduces clonally, meaning that all offspring are genetically identical to their mothers.

We will quantify the non-genetic inheritance generated by exposure to different common freshwater pollutants by comparing the growth, survival, reproduction and patterns of gene expression of genetically identical offspring from ancestors exposed to pollution or not. The relative importance of parental effects and epigenetic inheritance will be assessed by determining whether differences in offspring traits in exposed and non-exposed lineages are explained by differences in offspring provisioning or changes in the patterns of genes switched on or off and the epigenetic marks responsible for folding DNA molecules in the cell. Finally, we will assess the evolutionary implications of non-genetic inheritance by determining whether the exposure of ancestors to pollutants changes the outcome of competition experiments between replicated genetically identical populations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>i) Who will benefit from this research and how? 

a) Commercial private sector interested in the monitoring and prevention of freshwater pollution.
By studying differences in the patterns of gene expression of clones exposed to specific environmental stressors it will be possible to develop ecotoxicological bioassays that illuminate both the mode of action of different types of pollutants, but also the degree of exposure. Such assays would have commercial and legislative value in the fields of ecotoxicology, environmental consultancy and water treatment. 

b) Policy makers
Governments all around the world currently use the survival and reproduction of Daphnia as a test for determining acceptable thresholds of freshwater pollutants. The development of tests based on genomic approaches will provide a more direct assessment of the in situ pollution levels and more detail about the nature of pollutant exposure. Current tests make no provision for non-genetic inheritance, despite the fact that resistance to different stressors can occur over a number of generations. Our data will quantify this problem, enabling a re-assessment of current methodologies.

c) Wider public.
By improving the procedures and policy used to monitor freshwater pollution, and reducing the chances of pollutants entering the food chain, the project will preserve natural environments, a societal benefit, and decrease risks to human health. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly being implicated with the environmental modulation of numerous diseases including aging, cancer, schizophrenia and lifestyle diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Understanding how the environment can alter epigenetic states, and how stable these effects are over generations, will also therefore have a direct health benefit for the wider public. 

d) Wider public - public understanding of science.
Reversing the public perception that evolution is a slow process is important given that anthropogenic effects are the primary driver of rapid evolutionary change. Second, the concepts of non-genetic inheritance and epigenetics are poorly understood by the general public, although their increasing implication in the manifestation of disease process means that it is imperative that these topics enter the public domain. 

e) Training of scientists
The project will train researchers in state of the art ecological genomic techniques that are transferable to other fields such as health and medicine, stem cell technology, disease biology, agriculture, conservation, and environmental sciences.

f) Other fields of academic research
Our findings will be of broad interest to a range of different disciplines including:

- Evolutionary biologists and Molecular ecologists interested in mechanisms of adaptation and resolving the debate concerning the need for broader definition of inheritance.
- Ecotoxicologists interested in understanding acclimation to pollutants and developing genomic biomarkers.
- Developmental biologists interested in developing a model system in which to study epigenetics. As a crustacean, Daphnia provides a useful comparison with Drosophila to test whether same genes are subject to epigenetic control across species. 
- Medical scientists interested in studying the epigenetic mechanisms associated with cancers and other pathologies. Many of the genes involved are conserved across species, and so the study of the interaction between the environment and the epigenome in another model species may highlight novel processes of interest to medical epigenetics. 
- Environmental scientists interested in the persistence of toxins in the environment and the transfer of effects from one generation to the next.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>487678</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>John Colbourne (Daphnia genomics consortium)</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC3260BB-A760-40C8-AD42-8E291131F31C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Plaistow, S.J., Colbourne, J. &amp;amp; Paterson, S.

This has led to the submission of a further NERC standard grant. We have also begun to apply the knowledge gleaned in the grant to rapid adaptation in the wild. Our results led directly to a NERC highlight topic grant on limits to adaptation. 

The results in our grant have also led to a new Royal Society partnership that we are using as outreach. In collaboration with Dr John Dyer (Head of science innovation at UTC) we are designing and overseeing an annual Daphnia work package at the UTC that will involve cohorts of 30-50 students each year. Our primary goals are (i) to link the research in our laboratory to the learning of science-orientated students at the UTC; (ii) to create a &amp;quot;hands-on&amp;quot; learning experience introducing students (and indirectly their parents) to non-genetic inheritance and its ecological, evolutionary and health significance; (iii) to have students develop generic field and laboratory skills they can use in academia or vocational careers in the health and life sciences, (iv) to publish in titles such as the Journal of Biological Education and generate clone collections and knowledge of direct relevance to the research in the PI's lab.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8477A825-FB1A-4D29-AF69-A979D8F7095A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546381e33fb853.99219494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Below I summarise the outcomes from the 4 main objectives of the grant: 1) To quantify and compare the nature and duration of non-genetic inheritance generated by exposure to different types of novel anthropogenic stressor. - we have demonstrated that exposure to pollution can alter the phenotypes of descendants in the three generations following exposure. The exact outcome of exposure to pollutant differed according to the pollutant parents were exposed to and the genotype of the parents but primarily affected growth and development. 2) To assess to what extent patterns of non-genetic inheritance arise through epigenetic processes and determine whether epigenetic effects vary for different kinds of stressor. We examined the phenotypes associated with non-genetic inheritance in more detail using gene expression microarrays to identify genes and genetic pathways differentially expressed in descendants of ancestors exposed to freshwater pollutants (indirect evidence of non-genetic inheritance). The data generated is quite inconclusive. We are still investigating new ways to analyse this data to extract the most meaning from it. 3) To identify genome wide changes in epigenetic modification following exposure to a novel stressor and quantify natural variation in these regions among different clones from a natural population. We used whole genome bisulphite sequencing to test the hypothesis that exposure to pollution (Cadmium, Glyphosate, 4-Nonylphenol) can induce epigenetic modifications that can then be stably inherited. We found that in D. pulex, 0.71% of cytosines in the CpG context are heavily methylated (more than 50%). Of those, they were significantly more likely to be in promoters or exons. We identified approximately 1000 genes that had at least 1 SNP differentially methylated in response to our different pollution treatments. Approximately 1/3 of those were overlapping between treatments. Nearly half of the SNP's remained differentially methylated after the pollutant exposure had been removed for 8 months (approximately 16 generations) providing evidence for stable pollution induced epigenetic inheritance. 4) To determine to what extent non-genetic inheritance can alter the evolutionary dynamics of experimental populations. We tested the hypothesis that pollution induced NGI can alter eco-evolutionary dynamics. Pollution-induced NGI altered relative clone frequencies causing differences in the population dynamics over the first 25 weeks of the experiment, but as clone frequencies converged, differences in population dynamics disappeared. In non-polluted populations clone frequencies and population dynamics were initially similar, but as populations approached carrying capacity NGI altered relative clone frequencies. In these populations, an effect of NGI on clone frequency was still apparent after 42 weeks, demonstrating that NGI can influence eco-evolutionary dynamics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our data might lead to the development of ecotoxicological bioassays and has implications for ecological risk assessment. We are already beginning to collaborate with industry (UNILEVER) in this regard. More detailed understanding of epigenetic inheritance may be important in understanding how genes and the environment lead to phenotypic variation. This may be especially important for traits like complex diseases which cannot be understood based on DNA sequence alone. Our work may also provide a detailed example of how exposure to novel environments can lead to rapid evolution in populations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94A9FB1E-6BB4-4D43-8546-228C4571E318</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463811091c274.54362670</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Effect of 3 pollutants on descendant phenotypes over the next 3 generations for 3 Daphnia pulex clones from a single population</gtr:description><gtr:id>87F47AA6-6557-4F16-86B3-C97E4D33D9B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still be written up</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d6f7353c28.13534824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Persistence of pollution induced NGI on phenotype</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The effect of long-term glyphosate exposure on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of 40 Daphnia pulex experimental populations over 42 weeks</gtr:description><gtr:id>08F8FB44-294D-4B28-88F8-2D0D6AEF2223</gtr:id><gtr:impact>still being written up</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d787cfcda6.65265269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pollution effects on Eco-Evolutionary dynamics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We reviewed, tested and refined techniques for analysing probabilistic maturation reaction norms.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C845995-9A09-4A5A-B442-A37E66C54E04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546365d4f19b73.74183012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Models for analysing maturation data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We use phenotypic change vectors to qualify and quantify differences in whole organism multivariate plasticity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>086B7D0C-A5E7-407A-9B49-F34D51868D31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463653e3750b0.83549302</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Phenotypic change vectors</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The effect of chronic exposure to CD, Glyphosate and 4-Nonylphenol on Daphnia pulex microRNA expression</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE21798C-628B-41E9-A94F-9768F19150F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>still being written up</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d7fc738ed4.82772142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Micro RNA expression</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Pollutant effects on Daphnia pulex methylome for Cadmium, Glyphosate, 4-Nonyl-phenol and their persistence over 16 generations</gtr:description><gtr:id>7F62D10A-DE32-412C-9BC2-69A55D08F20A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper is still being written</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9bb063f77a5.19033331</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pollutant effects on D. pulex methylome</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a semi-automated image analysis technique for studying Daphnia population dynamics</gtr:description><gtr:id>3173C13B-57E8-4588-988F-1AE4535C5DF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Allows the study of eco-evolutionary feedback loops</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6c46551df80.31887200</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Semi-automated Daphnia population counts</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D55E8F3-23E8-4C32-811F-2EBFFCE1A062</gtr:id><gtr:title>How to measure maturation: a comparison of probabilistic methods used to test for genotypic variation and plasticity in the decision to mature.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Evolution;
