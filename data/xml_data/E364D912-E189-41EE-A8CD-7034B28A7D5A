Was it &amp;quot;weany, weedy, weaky&amp;quot;, as the schoolboy joke has it? How do we know - how can we know - how Latin or other dead languages were pronounced? 19th and 20th century scholarship developed methods for reconstructing the pronunciation of words from the past, and extended this to inferring the forms of words from a time before any written records exist. For example, from word-forms as diverse as Modern English &amp;quot;work&amp;quot;, Old English &amp;quot;weorc&amp;quot;, Old High German &amp;quot;werc&amp;quot;, Latin &amp;quot;orgia&amp;quot;, Greek &amp;quot;ergon&amp;quot;, and Armenian &amp;quot;gorc&amp;quot;, philologists infer a Proto-Indo-European stem uerg-, a formula hinting at a pronunciation something like &amp;quot;werg&amp;quot;. But what did it actually sound like? In this project, I shall apply and further develop some new software methods developed in the last few years by me and my collaborator and project partner, the Cambridge statistics Professor John Aston, to triangulate backwards from contemporary audio recordings of simple words in modern languages to regenerate audible spoken words from the past. To achieve this we use speech signal processing techniques borrowed from speech synthesis to analyse the modern recordings, represent them using mathematical functions, infer possible and probably ancestral forms using computational statistical techniques, and finally convert the inferred ancestral forms back into audible speech, using speech synthesis. In our first experiments, we have been working on modelling sound changes that led to the current pronunciations of French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese digits, from earlier Romance words originally going back to Latin. In this project I shall extend this work to some Germanic languages (English, German dialects and Dutch), together with Modern Greek, to try to advance the horizon of audio reconstruction into the deeper past of the Indo-European language family. This enterprise is similar to the virtual reconstruction of e.g. the visualisation through animation of dinosaurs in documentaries or films, or the reconstruction of ancient pottery or other objects. If we only have a few sherds or bone-fragments to go on, the reconstruction of a vase or skull will be largely a virtual reconstruction, e.g. a drawing or model. Audio reconstruction is, equally, a virtual addition to our construction of the past. 
 Previously, philologists have amassed a considerable and deep understanding of what sound changes have taken place in various languages, and to some extent, when; the how or why remain areas of speculation. Acoustic modelling of speech evolution makes possible an improved understanding of what, and casts light on how, if only by unveiling possibilities. And evolutionary modelling will benefit by more refined and empirically accurate models of language change; for instance by discovering whether or how historical change in language differs in detail from biological evolution.
 In addition to our specific technical aims, this type of work has wider ramifications for the dividing line that is normally drawn between science and humanities. This work storms across that line, bringing science and computation into an area of work that was previously firmly part of Classics and linguistics. Such a redrawing of disciplinary boundaries challenges and redefines old conceptions of the &amp;quot;two cultures&amp;quot; of arts vs. science. In this endeavour, each side needs the other: without the quantitative computational techniques from those sciences, comparative philologists are largely confined to written records and symbol-oriented methods; without linguistic-historical knowledge, statistical speech science would be forced to re-trace centuries of philological work, unncessarily (and perhaps unsuccessfully). This work brings new methods from science into an area of cultural studies, and deploys cultural knowledge to advance those new scientific methods. It demolishes a wall between &amp;quot;Science&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Culture&amp;quot;.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wider, non-academic audience for the results of our historical reconstructions include school teachers of languages that are no longer spoken (e.g. in better informing students as to the most likely original pronunciation). Archaeologists in museums and universities, as custodians of the relics of ancient civilizations, might also naturally be interested in this work. Just as the virtual reconstruction of artefacts and animals from the past is also evident in e.g. TV documentaries (such as &amp;quot;Time Team&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&amp;quot;) and films (&amp;quot;Jurassic Park&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Stargate&amp;quot;), there could also be some reception of our results in those areas. The overall impact of dissemination of our work and its results to these wider audiences will be to improve public understanding of what older stages of languages were like - in particular, by &amp;quot;bringing them to life&amp;quot; again, to challenge the increasingly common view that dead languages and/or education in classical languages are of no relevance to modern life. Furthermore, this work strongly challenges the increasingly fragmented view of learning, in which humanities and sciences are seen as disjoint cultures, each of which is somewhat uncomprehending of the other. Any public discussion of our work must recognise that this is not a product of humanities OR science, but an essential fusion of the two, with neither side laying any claim to priority over the other.

In order to engage the interest of non-academic audiences, I shall present our work and its outputs, and make our data and software freely available, through our websites. I shall inform print and broadcast journalists of it, through our press office, and we shall seek opportunities to offer presentations, richly illustrated with audio examples, at events aimed at secondary education, such as outreach talks and open days.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>63531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Science Festival 2015 (Bradford)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1A42B86-1015-4ED3-A8CB-9E0362A7BC0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a lecture about the Ancient Sounds project at the British Science Festival.
