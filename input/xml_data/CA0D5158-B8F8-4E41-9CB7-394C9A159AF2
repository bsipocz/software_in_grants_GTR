In durable nonwovens the hygiene problem is addressed mostly through anti-microbials such as silver and quaternary ammonium compounds. However these present environmental and toxicological risks, are of limited efficacy on biofilms, and also present a risk of increasing microbial resistance. Recently the screening of a library of over 600 furanone derived lactams has revealed variants that disrupt quorum sensing during biofilm growth and development. This feasibility project will explore the application of these as anti-biofilm coatings on nonwoven textiles. Using different application techniques during manufacture, analogues will be covalently and non-covalently bound within the matrices, or at the surface, of polyolefin and cellulosic materials. The efficacy and durability of the antifouling coating on nonwoven products will be explored and the possibility of a biotechnology platform that covers a range of applications across durable nonwoven market segments will be assessed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Within the nonwovens sector personal and household care, hygiene, medical and filtration products are constantly challenged by microbial contamination.

Namely, the beneficiaries of the research include those benefiting from:

a. the commercial adoption of the non-woven devices themselves (the general public, the environment and facilities providers, the UK economy);

b. the substitution of antimicrobial agents for non-mutation driving chemistries (the general public, the public health sector, the environment);

c. the research findings generated through the research process.

Firstly, the treated consumer products will benefit the general public. Specifically, they will provide users with an affordable multi-use alternative for the current disposable wipes, resulting in effective hygiene promoting products with reduced probability of side effects after use (eg skin irritation).

Similarly, as a consequence to the substitution of disposable product with multi-use alternative, the outputs of this projects will result in less waste thus lower burden on facilities providers such as the local councils (landfill facilities) and water board (sewer blockage); this will lead to a positive environmental impact.

Additionally, the UK economy, via the development of a new business offering from the partner Unilever and its suppliers, will benefit from the outputs of this project.

Secondly, the substitution of antimicrobial agents that are known to drive selection of antibiotic resistant strains with a benign alternative will benefit the general public and public health sector by potentially slowing the rate of bacterial and microbial mutation through reducing frequency of exposure to antimicrobials.

In addition, current antimicrobial agents contain chemicals that are harmful for the environment (heavy metals and quaternary ammonium compounds). The substitution of current consumer offerings with the more sustainable, nature-derived and benign alternatives proposed in this project will thus benefit the environment through reduced pollution.

Finally, the research findings generated will find wider applications in the fields of bioscience and textile science. Specifically, the knowledge gained from the modifications of the lactams will provide a deeper understanding of their mode of action and scope for modification (e.g. solubility). These will have a number of ramifications regarding the selection, modification and use of lactams that will stimulate further research in the development of future anti-biofilm agents. Similarly, the knowledge gained concerning the scope for modification and immobilisation/location of bioactive agents on textile materials will have direct applications in the field of textile science and textile finishing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49523</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Currently formulating research 4* paper</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>390E670C-126C-4C4D-A203-AF961D9589EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58be7d0515dc05.23551307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Lactam chemistry provides antimicrobial activity on textiles and paper</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Applied for further BBSRC funding</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>023EA229-0717-4094-ACE1-8681E9C35F9D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58be7c50f0b3a8.21576160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P000231/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5B73146D-6DEF-4D88-BE83-FE7B9DB21D62</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
