The Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Ethnic Diversity and Social Cohesion</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L011255/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This FRL project is concerned with how rising immigration and increasing ethnic diversity affect social cohesion. The UK is currently undergoing a significant demographic shift in the ethnic composition of its populace, with the proportion of non-White British rising from 13% to 20% between 2001 and 2011. Across academic, governmental and public spheres, concerns are being articulated that this growing diversity poses a threat to: residential community cohesion (undermining trust and connectivity between neighbours); wider, societal cohesion (leading to civic disengagement, declining trust in strangers and lower support for welfare policies); and inter-group cohesion (cultivating inter-ethnic tensions, and driving support for far-right organisations). When even conservative estimates predict this trend will only increase, understanding if, how and why ethnic diversity affects social cohesion, and what can be done to ameliorate any pejorative effects, is of paramount importance to the maintenance of a cohesive, harmonious society.

Yet, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how of ethnic diversity affects social cohesion. Firstly, much of the current research focuses on how being exposed to diversity within one's residential community affects social cohesion. However, the community is just one site at which individuals come into contact with other ethnic groups. In places like schools, universities, workplaces, volunteering groups, individuals are being exposed to diverse environments everyday. However, how levels of diversity in these places affect social cohesion is largely unknown. This is an important omission given that individuals are actually more likely to encounter diversity in these places than in their neighbourhoods. Secondly, most research assumes that as diversity within an adult's neighbourhood increases, their social cohesion will shift accordingly. However, how adults respond to ethnically diverse environments is likely influenced by all kinds of experiences throughout their lives, such as the attitudes of their parents, the diversity of their schools, and how diverse the neighbourhoods were they grew up in. To understand how diversity affects social cohesion we therefore also need to know what individuals' experiences of ethnic diversity have been over their entire lives. 

The primary aim of this research is therefore to try and create a much fuller picture of how ethnic diversity affects social cohesion by: firstly, looking at how coming into contact with other groups in schools, workplaces, or civic groups, along with neighbourhoods, affects cohesion; and secondly, how experiences of diversity over one's whole life affects cohesion. Only with this more complete picture of the complex social worlds of individuals can we hope to understand the effect of diversity on social cohesion. However, if we do find that increasing diversity, in certain places, at certain points over an individual's life, can harm social cohesion, then we need to know 'what works' to ameliorate such frictions. This research will therefore investigate how interventions, such as intercultural education, workplace diversity training, national multiculturalism policies, and ethnic mixing programs for adolescents can help alleviate any pressures of increasing diversity. Key to this endeavour will be an analysis of one of the current government's key integration policies: the National Citizen Service.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the topical yet sensitive nature of the debate into ethnic diversity and social cohesion this FRL project has the capacity to have substantial impact across a range of non-academic beneficiaries, significantly contributing to the maintenance of a vibrant and fair society; in particular, through its production of a robust evidence-base on the efficacy of site-specific and national interventions, alongside its investigation of the government's National Citizen Service (NCS). See 'pathways to impact' for a full list of beneficiaries.

1. Governmental departments and policy groups
The findings will have direct relevance for bodies dealing with integration and cohesion, including the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Race and Community. However, the scope of this project, integrating adults and adolescents, across sites such as workplaces, communities, and schools, is relevant to a range of departments e.g. Education, the Home Office, the Cabinet Office, and the DWP, with the capacity to demonstrate the need for cross-departmental approaches to issues of social cohesion, pertinent given the government's predominant focus on communities as key sites of integration and the relegation of national government to 'exceptional circumstances'. The project will also provide critical feedback into the efficacy of a flagship governmental policy: the NCS. This project will also aid local government, providing key evidence for supporting collaborations between schools, community groups, civic organisations and employers in the management of local issues of cohesion. Given parallel international debates, this project has the ability to contribute similarly to non-UK governments. 

2. NCS Trust and youth engagement schemes
The NCS analysis will provide both robust monitoring of its efficacy and evidenced-based insights into how the aims of the scheme (such as fostering positive out-group relations and social cohesion) can be effectively maximised (especially through the analysis of randomised prejudice-reduction interventions). This body of evidence will also prove useful for other youth organisations and 'service learning' schemes aiming to contribute (locally or nationally) to local, inter-group and wider social cohesion, both within and outside of the UK.

3. Educational institutions and employers
The analysis of how diversity (and disadvantage) can affect both cohesion within these organisations, and wider societal cohesion, can build awareness of possible sites of friction. However, the analysis of within-site interventions, such as intercultural teaching and workplace diversity schemes, will provide effective evidence for negotiating issues of diversity amongst their members, as well as augmenting diversity's positive contribution, especially pertinent given the responsibilities of organisations to tackle issues of discrimination and equality.

4. Third-sector organisations
The project findings will resonate strongly with third-sector organisations working on issues of social cohesion, in the UK and internationally. In particular, those organisations promoting cohesion by bringing together representatives from local business, schools, voluntary organizations, housing services, and community groups may particularly benefit from the holistic analysis of such approaches to social cohesion. 

5. Public sphere
This project will also contribute to the debates ongoing within political, media and general-public spheres. The application of quantitative modelling to large-scale, representative data sets will produce a strong evidence-base to examine the myriad claims of the impacts of immigration and ethnic diversity on society. Ultimately, however, all individuals will benefit from the maintenance of a harmonious and cohesive society, while the parallel analysis of disadvantage may potentially help refocus the debate on to forces more detrimental to social cohesion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233023</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Citizen Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the National Citizen Service</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E780FC1-62E8-46C6-940E-44FAC359C1F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- A series of questions I produced have been added to the National Citizen Service evaluation study currently being undertaken

Work on the National Citizen Service

The National Citizen Service (NCS) is a UK Government sponsored scheme engaging 15-17 year olds in a programme of service learning. It is run by the NCS Trust, alongside the Cabinet Office. The NCS Trust supported my original project application. Since beginning the project I have been liaising with both the NCS Trust and Cabinet Office to be able to examine the efficacy of the scheme for social cohesion. This has involved invitations to discuss the project at the NCS Trust offices, at the Cabinet Office, and an invitation to participate in the All Party Parliamentary Group on the National Citizen Service and Volunteering. Through discussions with the NCS Trust/Cabinet Office, I was able to have a number of survey questions specific to my research project included on the 2015-16 Cabinet Office-run evaluation of the NCS programme, which aimed to improve the evaluation's measurement of issues related to social cohesion and inter-group relations. I have also managed to secure access to the full evaluation data.

As the data is currently being collected, the potential impact from this element of my project is yet to fully emerge. However, based on the engagement with the NCS/Cabinet Office, I have been invited to become part of the NCS Advisory Committee, organised by the Cabinet Office, to discuss methods of improving the scheme's outcomes. Furthermore, this work has led me to help other youth organisations (e.g. City Year) design and develop their own evaluation programmes.

2. Work with government/policy

My current work, including my recent publications, has also led me to develop ties within government. This has included an invitation to give evidence to the government commissioned Louise Casey Review on issues of integration in the UK. It has also led to invitations to discuss my research with the members of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG); in particular, my current research into the role of segregation in social cohesion. The DCLG are currently beginning a new project into examining processes of integration and cohesion in the UK and my work has helped inform new directions to take their investigation. In particular, this involved meetings with members of the DCLG on the measurement of ethnic diversity and residential segregation, and the opportunities this can provide for producing a typology of communities to focus on integration.

3. Wider-engagement

Recent research published in peer-reviewed journals has also been cited on Radio 4 and drawn on by journalists in discussions of immigration and cohesion, as well as generating a number of reddit threads. Subsequent formal press releases generated attentions within a number of national publications (e.g. the Daily Mail, the Times), international publications (e.g. Junge Freiheit/Germany) and regional publications (e.g. Northwest Property Trade magazine), as well as invitations to discuss the findings on the radio (e.g. BBC Three Counties), and invitations to write blog posts for Think Tanks (e.g. Policy Exchange).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2DB78454-97E0-4B17-B136-D1AF511C4525</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b4b16c4c16a8.60307189</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has, thus far, made a number of key developments in the field of ethnic diversity, immigration and social cohesion:

- The role of segregation

Previous research has looked at how the ethnic composition of a community affects inter-group relations and social cohesion, producing, for the most part, mixed findings. However, we demonstrate how equally diverse communities can be either highly integrated or highly segregated. Incorporating segregation into our framework, we demonstrate that the impact of the ethnic composition of a community on prejudice is highly dependent on how segregated the community is. In more homogeneous areas, attitudes towards minorities are generally more positive. In diverse, integrated communities, inter-group relations are just as positive. It is only diverse, segregated communities in which inter-group tensions are apparent. Further analysis demonstrates that this is partly a consequence of a lack of mixing in diverse, segregated communities, and partly a consequence of residents perceiving minorities as a greater threat to their economic and social status.

In a related analysis, we extended this idea to examine the role of segregation in the oft-demonstrated negative relationship between ethnic diversity in a community and levels of trust amongst residents. Previous studies show how trust between neighbours appears lower in highly diverse neighbourhoods. We again incorporated segregation into this question. We tested whether the impact of living in a diverse neighbourhood is actually dependent on how segregated the wider-community is in which a neighbourhood is nested. In other words, is the negative effect concentrated in diverse neighbourhoods in which most people from different ethnic groups in the wider-community live apart? We found this to be the case: the impact of neighbourhood diversity on trust between residents is highly dependent on how segregated the wider-community is in which a neighbourhood is nested.

- A longitudinal test of the ethnic diversity and community cohesion debate

A significant volume of cross-sectional research has demonstrated that intra-neighbourhood cohesion is lower at higher levels of ethnic diversity. However, cross-sectional analysis is susceptible to a number of biases which could be driving these findings. I therefore set out to robustly test the causal claims behind the findings that ethnic diversity might harm local social cohesion. Applying 3-waves of UK panel data, spanning a period of 17 years, I examined how attitudes amongst residents change: if a community becomes more diverse around them; or, if they move from a more/less diverse community into a less/more diverse community. I found that, on one hand, the current cross-sectional literature is correct: if a community becomes more diverse around residents they report less positive attitudes towards their local area. Similarly, if a resident moves from a more diverse to a less diverse community, they generally report an improvement in attitudes. However, residents moving from a more homogeneous area to a more mixed area do not develop less positive feelings towards their areas. Therefore, while diversity can undermine residents' feelings towards their communities, at the same time, this likely depends, to some extent, on prior-attitudes towards diversity. 

- The role of positive and negative mixing between ethnic groups

Positive inter-group mixing is seen as a key tool towards building positive inter-group relations and ameliorating potential conflict between ethnic groups. In particular, as a country becomes more diverse, while it may generate perceived-threats, it also provides opportunities for threat-reduction through greater inter-group mixing. However, much of this research has (at least implicitly) assumed that the mixing experienced as diversity increases will be positive. We aimed to examine the idea that ethnic diversity may bring greater opportunities for both positive and negative contact, and that while the former can help rescind prejudicial attitudes the latter may foment them. Examining this we found that increasing diversity does increase rates of positive and negative contact, i.e. that diversity can drive both positive and negative effects via greater inter-group mixing. Much of the current debate focuses on the idea that it is the absence of mixing which results in the problems of diversity. However, these findings demonstrate that mixing, in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to positive outcomes, and more attention needs to be paid to the conditions of the mixing, and cultivating more positive forms (and limiting more negative forms).

- Ethnic diversity across neighbourhoods and workplaces 

Much of the debate into how increasing ethnic diversity affects social cohesion and inter-group relations has focused on the experiences of residential communities. However, neighbourhoods form just one context across which individuals experience ethnic diversity. One key context that has received far less attention is the workplace. We demonstrate that individuals in more diverse workplaces tend to generally report more positive attitudes towards minority groups, compared to individuals in more diverse neighbourhoods. This is driven by the much higher levels of positive mixing that occurs across this context, relative to neighbourhoods.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The hope is that these findings may be useful to a number of different audiences.
