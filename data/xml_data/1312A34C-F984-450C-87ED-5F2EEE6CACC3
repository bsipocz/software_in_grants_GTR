basketry</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N007697/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Woven Communities: the Warp and the Weft aims to draw on practical basketry as an important tool for enhancing public engagement with museum collections and as a means of extending reminiscence work within museums and promoting design thinking. We will work with the Scottish Basketmakers Circle (SBC), our partners from an earlier project, and 5 new partners: National Museums of Rural Life, the Highland Folk Museum, the Scottish Fisheries Museum, Shetland Museum, and An Lanntair, a multi-arts centre on Lewis. 

The project has four key aims. First, we will carry out a series of public engagement activities in museums linked to their basketry collections with the aim of eliciting life histories and social memories, and thus increasing audience engagement. We have found that making and demonstrating craft activities such as basketry are very productive in reminiscence sessions. Yet while artefacts are often employed as important reference points for eliciting social memories, the actual practice of making such artefacts is only now being considered. Secondly, we will draw on the technical benefit of basket-makers working with museum curators to enhance knowledge of early 20th century Scottish basketry collections. Thirdly, we aim to explore the significance of basketry for design thinking. Because basketry is not replicable by machine, many design processes such as planning, problem-solving and innovation are embedded in the practical act of basket-work. This has led us to consider the value of thinking-in-practice and dynamic problem-solving attendant on basketry, as an important aspect of design thinking. In discussion with CraftScotland and the Craft Council, we will develop a paper for informing craft policy on this theme. Finally, the interactive nature of our website has led to us being approached by An Lanntair, Lewis, which has requested we contribute to their bi-lingual (Gaelic/English) dementia project, drawing on our practical basketry skills for eliciting hand-memories with elders with dementia on Lewis

To achieve these aims we will conduct practical reminiscent events focussed around workshops and replica making in each venue. These will range from making Easter straw bonnets, fishing creels and sculls, to Traveller basketry, exploring the whole process from gathering raw materials (such as heather) to finished product, and involving all generations. Through the regionally specific nature of these events, it may even be possible to link artefacts in collections with descendants of former users or producers. We will invite a Masters student from Museum Studies in St Andrews to document and upload the data as part of their dissertation project. We will video record practitioners making key basket forms to further document memories and discussion linked to the events. This will also enable us to extend our capacity for conveying skills, and provide legacy material for use by museums. 

Outcomes will include increased public engagement with museum collections, and therefore enhanced impact, as more regional public contribute to knowledge about their own social history through practical engagement. This will lead to new and accessible insights to the social history of collections. Through working with makers, curators will gain improved documentation of collections. There will be greater understanding of the benefits of handwork for working with people with dementia; and of the value of handwork for design thinking through our policy document for craft and design education. Several of our partners have agreed to host study days tailored to their collections, which will further extend impact and public engagement, as will the international symposium which will form the culmination of the project. Several of our partners have also expressed a keen interest in developing a touring exhibition and catalogue following the project. We also aim to produce an illustrated and accessible book as further legacy of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through working with our partners, we will have access to and engagement with audiences across Scotland, from the Central Lowlands, the Northern and Western Isles, the Highlands to the east coast. Impact from the project will extend through our public engagement projects beyond museums and galleries to their audiences, substantially increasing access to collections.
1. The practical reminiscence sessions hosted by our partners will enhance public engagement with museum collections and generate new cultural knowledge. Thus, more regional public will learn about their social history through basketry, a fabric of society intimately bound up with their community's past skills and practices. They will also learn more about their local museum collection and its links with other museums at a national level.
2. These activities will develop new contexts for use of the collections through the local histories elicited in interaction with the public. Both 1&amp;amp;2 will enhance audience engagement and attendance.
3. We will develop understanding of and techniques for making significant, but no-longer made basket forms such as sculls, mudags and ciosans, extending this knowledge through our makers to curators, museums and their communities.
4. By updating the new material generated for museums with illustrated records, we will ensure enhancement of museum information and improve curatorial knowledge which will have benefit beyond the life of the project, while at the same time training a student for the future.
5. The NMoRL and Highland Folk Museum have collections from across Scotland. Collaborating on a national project will enhance communication between national and regional museums, developing regional knowledge exchange and enabling organizations to learn more about the extent and connections between their collections.
6. Our document for crafts educational policy on the value of craft practice for memory and design thinking will further extend impact through educational and craft networks.
7. All our partners encourage best use of their collections through public events, including study days and exhibitions. We will enhance impact by running a series of study days and an international symposium. These include one study day at NMoRL, Creating a Reminiscence Space, aimed at craft, educational and social history professionals, including the Scottish Vernacular Buildings Working Group, Scottish Working People's History Trust, and Social History Curators' Group. A second at the NMoRL, with demonstrations of materials and harvesting, will be open to the wider public. The international symposium, Basketry: Making, Memory, and Mind, at St Andrews will synthesize findings from the whole project, inviting national and international participants, including anthropologists, craft-and design-historians, ethno-botanists, social historians, art students, curators, craft experts, psychologists, policy makers and the general public.
Each event will be advertised widely and open to the public, and we will ensure maximum audiences through the museums' publicity.
8. We also aim to curate a small exhibition of the project. At this stage we cannot commit to this taking place within the timeframe of the project. The National Museum, Shetland Museum and An Lanntair have expressed interest in this.
9. Our interactive website, which we will continue to update during the project, will further extend audiences. All partners will have links to the website.
10. We will produce an illustrated accessible volume, with input from our basket-makers and curatorial partners, on the social history of Scottish communities through baskets.
11. Each museum will have a much stronger, more accessible knowledge base for contextualisation and publicizing its collections to encourage new audiences to engage with them beyond the timespan of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75793</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition - Woven Communities, a fabric of society</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6274873-40AE-4544-B3FF-D6911B369BFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An in-depth look at the many and various baskets used by fisherfolk, exploring the techniques and materials used to create the specialised shapes and forms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c941d4ab2f16.59539427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Woven Communities 2  Symposium 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2CCEC368-8CC3-43FD-BCF6-B570BDCEBA13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>3 day symposium</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9428ca9b174.72152353</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N007697/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3EA5AAEC-135B-436C-8F77-F32CCCA7FF8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>813866E9-8B0A-431C-A847-83DDED510CF0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rel, Material &amp; Cog Anthrop</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
