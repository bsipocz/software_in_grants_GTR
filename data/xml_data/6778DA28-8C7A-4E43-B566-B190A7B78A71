However, small-scale local enterprises generally do not have the wherewithal to provide dedicated roles and expertise in sustainability and environmental stewardship. This problem can be overcome by university researchers, with expertise in these areas, working closely with small enterprises to create mutually beneficial, practical and economically viable solutions that are feasible at the local and regional levels.

This research project will carry out practice-based research at the local/regional level, working with micro-enterprises (&amp;lt;10 employees) to develop a practical Guide and online line resources for the implementation of design for sustainability in local 'making' businesses (small-scale manufacturing - furniture, lighting, ceramics, etc.). The Guide and its interactive resources will be a practical resource for designers and local enterprises and will provide a basis for these enterprises to upload examples, share their insights, add relevant information and offer feedback - thus offering a continuous improvement model that will be a valuable resource for businesses and for academics to build an effective, practical Guide and resources that are of real-world value.

This research will bring together the considerable expert knowledge of the PI (design for sustainability) and the Co-I (design futures) with first-hand information and insights from local/regional enterprises and associated stakeholders (chambers of commerce, business groups, suppliers etc.). In this way, the project will benefit from knowledge exchange between academia and business, will lay the groundwork for practical impact and thus will be beneficial to the competitiveness and economy future of the study region (Cumbria). The research findings, insights, lessons learned and approach can then be adapted to suit the needs of enterprises in other regions.

The research approach will begin by combining theoretical information and principles in design for sustainability and design futures with information gathered from field research in the study region. This provides a basis for design practice. Based on findings, the development of context-specific design criteria will lead to initial design concepts. Drawing on the practical experience, expertise and design skills of the PI, Co-I and RAs, initial design concepts will form a basis for workshops or exploratory dialogues with local enterprises and associated stakeholders. Design criteria will be refined, concepts will be modified and new directions identified. A further set of design concepts will lead to a series of design prototypes, which will form the basis of further dialogues with enterprises, the results of which will form the basis of the Guide (e.g. Design for Sustainability in Small Maker Enterprises: A 10 Step Guide) and associated, interactive resources. [This will be quite different from other guides currently available, such as the EUs Best Practice Guidance for Successful SME Engagement from the Institute of Sustainability which is &amp;quot;aimed primarily at individuals working in procurement/supply chain or contract management roles within large organisations&amp;quot;.]

The Guide and interactive website will be a practical resource for small maker enterprises and a valuable research tool for university researchers to continuously improve the practical impact and viability of context-specific research in design for sustainability.

The research findings will be widely disseminated. Key findings and materials will be included on the dedicated website. There will be a series of journal papers, a book, conference papers and practical workshops, exhibitions of prototypes and shorter articles in professional journals, magazines and e-zines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research upon a variety of non-academic beneficiaries can be summarized as follows:

- Local maker enterprises will be participants in, will contribute to, and will be provided with a guide that will allow them to effectively learn from academic research and other practitioners to develop and contribute to locally-appropriate, sustainable and meaningful designs, products and practices, and understand how these can be integrated with contemporary technologies, processes and communication strategies; 

- Consumers will be provided with innovative, locally relevant, sustainable and meaningful designs and products along with a raised awareness of ethical and environmentally responsible processes; 

- Commerce and industry will benefit from the development of commercially sustainable modes of engagement for the production of designs, products and practices that contribute to a new, more sustainable, meaningful and relevant rendition of material culture.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>464639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Unmaking Waste Exhibition, SASA Gallery, University of South Australia, Adelaide
