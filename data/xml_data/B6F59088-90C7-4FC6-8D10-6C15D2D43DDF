Supported by two research officers, Burns and Wolffe will collaborate with Archdeacon William Jacob of the diocese of London to convene seminars in which historical insights into contemporary problems will be discussed with leading figures in the diocese responsible for formulating both diocesan and national policy. Working with Neil Evans, the diocese's director of professional development, the historians will also contribute to training programmes for clergy and other local leaders, furnishing historical perspectives on practical concerns. Local seminars in locations across London will engage wider church and community audiences. All these encounters will draw on the resources of Lambeth Palace Library. Resource packs and a website will convey the fruits of the project as a whole to a still wider audience and provide expert guidance to those who may be inspired to further explore the history of their local church or congregation.\n\nThis pioneering project brings together two leading historians of modern English religion, the most important archive of the Church of England and the most dynamic and strategically important of its dioceses. The last twenty years have transformed academic understandings of the place of religion in modern English society, and produced a sophisticated appreciation of the dynamics of the Anglican church's relations with both national and local communities, as a pastoral and missionary enterprise, as an influence on public policy, and as a community in an increasingly multifaith environment. In exploring these themes, historians, including project leaders Wolffe and Burns, have devoted much attention to the history of the diocese of London, and exploited the rich holdings of Lambeth Palace Library. This is the leading national repository for English religious history, with collections designated outstanding by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council; and containing key archives for the religious history of London, including the papers of its Anglican bishops. \n\nYet much of this academic work remains largely unknown to current Anglican clergy and churchgoers, who are also unfamiliar with the rich archives on which it is based. This deprives the church of a vital intellectual asset in devising approaches to many current challenges. There are striking parallels with the issues that confronted the Victorian and Edwardian church; moreover local communities, both of churchgoers and non-churchgoers, lack crucial insights into the processes that generated the societies (and buildings) in which they find themselves. For the diocese of London, this is particularly the case given the wealth of relevant historical work and the importance of the issues encountered. It is a key metropolitan institution engaged with the multi-ethnic community of contemporary London through schools, community services, welfare provision, and the maintenance and utilisation of a rich built heritage.\n\nThis project has great potential benefits for all involved. Academics working on the history of the modern church will gain additional insight through understanding how the contemporary church operates.The historians will see the themes they are pursuing in a new light, and will be able to feed the knowledge they gain back into the wider scholarly community through articles and conference papers. Lambeth Palace Library will benefit from increased knowledge and usage of its important collections, so furthering its aim of promoting the utilization of its holdings. Local communities will acquire better self-understanding. And the diocese will be able to root its approach both to pastoral provision and serving the people of London ina better appreciation of its own past success and failures in these endeavours.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Religious Archives Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>President of Religious Archives Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>22586333-F42D-4291-B904-D7411243E426</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See above.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a4c68a4b73.62468770-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>See above.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a direct result of my profile in the development of religious archives arising from these projects, the Religious Archives Group has elected me as its President from 2017.

The relationships worked well and were managed through a steering group on which all four partners were represented. They continue to work together to develop and manage the legacy of the project.



The experience has given all partners increased confidence in pursuing further collaborations. The Open University is currently working in partnership with Royal Holloway University of London and in more informal collaboration with a range of religious bodies, in a ?follow-up? phase of the project. The experience has been particularly valuable for Lambeth Palace Library in demonstrating what can be achieved and in opening the door to further collaborations. They are currently discussing further partnerships with King's College London and with Royal Holloway University of London. The project helped to change the attitudes in the Library to working with external partners and their strategic plan now highlights outreach far more than it has in the past. The Bishop of London has recently demonstrated his sense of the developing potential of academic partnerships through consulting with several practitioners and academics, including Professor Burns, on strategies for promoting more ethical financial behaviour in the City of London.



During the course of the work an opportunity arose for a pilot project in partnership with a school, Christ Church Hampstead Church of England Primary: academic team members provided and advised on resources for the history of the school and nearby church which were then used by the school?s teaching staff to develop appropriate teaching materials for children from Reception to Year 6. Partnerships with two further schools (one primary, one secondary) are being developed in the ?Follow-On? phase of the project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Grant from Mercers Company</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Mercers Company</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>FBE7AEC4-41CE-468A-AE56-3CD4ACA63A5F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-449503390.537112360687a6cc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project stimulated the Church of England in London to reflect on its past on a much more informed and constructively self-critical manner than it did hitherto, helping to shape the development of subsequent vision and strategy.

Some of the key themes highlighted were:

? Exploring and appreciating the complexities of secularization and religious change; 

? The long-term experience of extensive migration as a formative influence on the religious life of London; 

? Research methods and resources for local religious history;

? The value of historical knowledge and perspective as a basis for informed responses to challenges facing churches and their leaders in the present day; 

? The role of history in shaping diverse and contingent identities;

? The community-building potential of collective engagement with history, both within religious organizations, and in strengthening their links with wider publics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The endeavour to make academic research more usable to non-academic contexts has been the central purpose and rationale of the project. Such uses will include: 

? Strategic reflection and planning by churches and other religious organizations; 

? The writing of church and parish histories by those not trained as professional historians; 

? Encouraging constructively critical engagement with the past by churchgoers and the general public; 

? Developing teaching resources for schools and the vocational training of clergy and ministers. 

These uses are enabled by dissemination through a website and a range of publications, including a printed and downloadable report, and a booklet specifically targeted at a non-academic readership.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52B66023-C0FC-4338-8D23-5876CC26862F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9559757960.55026775cc558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/buildingonhistory</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C1C5D5F7-A7A6-4BAA-8671-C97CC49723ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Church on its Past: Studies in Church History 50</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f0027b7d00e226e502c216ae8d30caf6"><gtr:id>f0027b7d00e226e502c216ae8d30caf6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe, John</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-954468-101-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5463213d4bb7f7.29121493</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>62C7C01D-1203-469D-AFD1-570990117DBC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Innovative Methods in the Study of Religion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3d7e3198b001388172892f4d52cd09f"><gtr:id>d3d7e3198b001388172892f4d52cd09f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>John Maiden (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_513067723313ba3b6a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B063910-FF57-49D3-811F-05FCD8138698</gtr:id><gtr:title>The chicken or the egg? building anglican churches and building congregations in a victorian london suburb</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Material Religion</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1"><gtr:id>b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0850859acfde1</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>00F6CAB5-FAB1-4542-9B1B-3520B3F55D57</gtr:id><gtr:title>Church Growth in Britain: 1980 to the Present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a13723c5683a28f9e7e61a04c710423c"><gtr:id>a13723c5683a28f9e7e61a04c710423c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe, John and Jackson, Bob</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4094-2576-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54632254de8de3.33751415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E78895E4-15A9-4DF6-8149-9188EF2F8C7E</gtr:id><gtr:title>From the Reformation to the Permissive Society</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b126955bca25a34cf0f0dec73975f3ac"><gtr:id>b126955bca25a34cf0f0dec73975f3ac</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burns, Arthur</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84383-558-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5463286c845f18.62012929</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F0AD1AC0-531B-4952-9FE4-4F447F66821A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards the Post-Secular City?
