However, because situations can arise where some of these bacteria can cause serious and life threatening infections, most of the research effort has focused on studying how they cause disease, rather than studying how they establish and maintain a healthy relationship with us their human hosts, despite the huge potential to identify and exploit novel health benefits. This proposal aims to address this deficit of knowledge by focusing on a specific bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, this is both a member of our upper respiratory tract micro-flora, but also can cause serious diseases.

The Massey and McLoughlin Labs have been working independently for many years to characterize how S. aureus interacts with its environment. A recent finding by the Massey Lab has brought the two groups together with a single purpose. The secretion of toxins by bacteria has for decades been considered an important part of how they cause disease, however we now believe that toxins are considerably more important to the ability of this bacteria to establish and maintain their healthy carriage status. While the McLoughlin Lab has been studying how toxin production allows S. aureus to survive for prolonged periods inside phagocytes (immune cells that engulf and usually destroy bacteria), the Massey Lab has been studying how toxins give S. aureus a competitive advantage against other bacterial member of our micro-flora. Bringing these findings together we now believe that they are key to the ability of these bacteria to exist in a healthy carriage status within us. 

The project will first determine how toxin expression allows S. aureus to maintain its presence while surrounded by other competing bacterial members of the micro-flora (objective 1). We will also determine the role toxin production plays in prolonging the ability of these bacteria to survive inside immune cells by interfering with a specific physiological pathway within the cells (objective 2). We will also characterise a novel system we have identified that we believe is responsible for the secretion of these toxins into the environment (objective 3). Finally we will demonstrate the importance of toxins to our co-existence with bacteria using a mouse model of carriage established in the McLoughlin Lab (objective 4).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Staphylococcus aureus is significant member of the human microbiome with between 20 and 60% of the human population being colonized, and we have demonstrated that toxin production by S. aureus is strongly associated with its colonisation status. Given the vast majority of interactions that occur between S. aureus and human is during colonization, this suggests that toxin production must play a significant role in this organism's ability to establish and maintain a healthy relationship with its host.

Our preliminary data suggest that toxin production has the dual effect of giving S. aureus a competitive advantage against other bacterial member of the nasal micro-flora, and prolonging survival inside phagocytes. We believe these combined activities are key to S. aureus' ability to establish and maintain its commensal life style. Verifying this experimentally is the major focus of this proposal, and will be achieved as follows:

Objective 1: Establishing the role of PSMs in maintaining competitiveness. Verify the role of PSM production for S. aureus in competing with other members of the nasal microbiome in conditions representative of the nose. 

Objective 2: Establishing the role of PSMs in facilitating intracellular survival through the manipulation of autophagic pathways. Verify that PSM production facilitates intracellular survival within phagocytes through the manipulation of autophagic pathways. 

Objective 3: Characterising the role of the MepRAB efflux system in PSM secretion. The role of the MepRAB system, which is a member of the MATE family of extrusions proteins, in the secretion of PSMs will be determined using a combination of protein focused analysis. 

Objective 4: Demonstrate in vivo that the dual effect of PSM production on intra-nasal competition and phagocyte subversion enables S. aureus to establish and maintain a commensal status. This will be achieved by verifying our in vitro findings in a mouse model of S. aureus colonization.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>How the trillions of bacteria that live in and on us maintain their colonization status in the face of competition from other microbes and the onslaught of our immune system is a fundamental biological question of which we have very little understanding. Additional impact may come from the focus of this study on a notorious AMR pathogen, where these finding could help identify novel means of preventing infection. Addressing this deficit of knowledge is the aim of this proposal.

The study of the human microbiome has received a lot of attention recently, and although some reports have been over-interpreted with correlation being confused with causation, it is widely accepted that our microbiome plays a significant role in our health. Despite this importance, all of the research to date focuses on the make up of the microbiome and how this associates with specific health conditions, with little attention given to how the individual species within the microbiome interact or how they interact with our immune system to enable them to exist on our bodies. An appreciation of how microbial communities outside of the gut modulate host immunity however, remains even less well established. There is emerging evidence that skin microflora can control immune homeostasis independently of the gut flora, but immunomodulation by the respiratory tract microbiome has never been comprehensively explored. 

Evolutionary biologists have for decades appreciated with complex role virulence plays in the evolution of microbes, where transmission is the ultimate driving force. However, this understanding does not always filter through to other researchers interested in microbiology. By focusing on Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrating the complex role of toxins in establishing a healthy relationship with humans, rather than causing disease, this work will help to bring the gap in appreciation for the complexity of microbial evolution.

Deliverables: Upon completion of this project we will have demonstrated the role toxin production (in particular the PSMs) play is giving S. aureus a competitive edge within the nasal micro-flora, and how this also enables S. aureus to survive for prolonged periods within phagocytes. We will also demonstrate how these features enable these bacteria to establish and maintain a healthy relationship with a model host organism.

Pharmaceutical Companies: 
Carriage of S. aureus can pose an infection risk for many of the species of animal that are colonized by them. For humans this risk is such that certain high-risk groups of patients are screened for carriage and often decolonized using topical antibiotics such as mupirocin. Understanding the factors that affect carriage could lead to the identification of novel decolonization strategies that do not involve the use of antibiotics. Thus minimizing the use of these drugs and reducing the selective pressure on the bacteria to evolve further resistance. To appreciate the potential financial impact of this we have compared this to the antibiotic mupirocin, and while specific figures are challenging to collect, in 2006 the global topical antibiotic and sulphonamide market was valued at more than US$800 million, with mupirocin making up a substantial proportion of this (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2007. 6, 865-866). As with all antibiotics, resistance to this is now developing and so alternative means of controlling infections are needed.

Patients, NHS, Veterinary Practices: 
The prevention of S. aureus infections through the development of a novel prophylactic strategy would simultaneously reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these infections, and reduce the use of antibiotic, a major aim of all antibiotic stewardship programs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>389251</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R009724/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>685A8D5E-BD8A-4D8D-BAC5-607439217156</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
