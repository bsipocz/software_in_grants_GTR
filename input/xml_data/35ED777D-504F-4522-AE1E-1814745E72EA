lungs are an excellent way of delivering pharmaceutical drugs into the body to treat
various diseases. This is because they have a large surface area, are moist and have a good
blood supply. Unlike tablet medicines, which are often slowly absorbed in the gut and then
processed by the liver before they can have their effect, inhaled drugs are absorbed more
rapidly and exert their effects quicker. Consequently, inhaled drugs are often in smaller doses
than oral forms, give fewer side-effects and likely to have a quicker onset of action, which can
lead to better control of disease symptoms and improved patient outcomes.
When pharmaceutical companies are developing inhaled drugs, for example for asthma, they
are mainly concerned with getting small-sized drug particles to reach the deepest parts of the
lung where it is assumed that the particles are absorbed into the body. However, little is
known about the way the drug interacts with the lung fluids. This is important to know as the
lung fluids are the initial point of contact for the drugs delivered by the inhaled route and the
media in which the drug dissolves/is released. Clearly, it is crucial to understand the
interaction between pharmaceutical drugs and the lung fluids so that drug release mechanisms
can be understood. There is currently no technology available to simulate the environment of
the deep lung so that these types of interactions can be researched.
Pulmorphix is in the process of developing an innovative technology which replicates lung
conditions. The objective of this research is to set up ways in which we can investigate how
inhaled drugs interact with lung fluids in an environment which closely resembles that of the
deep lung. This information is of value to scientists designing inhaled drugs as the
information generated by this technology will help them develop improved drug formulations -
which will ultimately improve patient quality of life (e.g. for individuals with asthma or
diabetes).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>86901</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710426</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
