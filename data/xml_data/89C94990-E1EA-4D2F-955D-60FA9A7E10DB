Disability history has developed over the past decade to show that meanings of impairment are not biologically determined but subject to change over time. Yet much of this research is focused on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and traces the historical roots of the barriers faced by disabled people in the present to citizenship. Research on disability before 1800 tends to focus on its more 'freakish' aspects, such as broadside accounts of 'monstrous births', rather than its more common manifestations. Furthermore, existing histories of disability are generally founded on institutional and top-down histories of what was done to disabled people; little is known about the experience of disability in history. Despite the view that the period from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries witnessed significant changes both in the treatment of disabled people and in social perceptions of disability, the era has not yet received detailed historical attention. 'Imagining Disability' seeks to make good this neglect, analysing cultural representations of disability and the testimonies of disabled people themselves to explore the meanings of impairment in this period. \n\nThe principal output of the project will be a monograph that provides the first book-length study of physical impairment in this period. Cultural meanings of disability will be explored via a diverse range of sources, from sermons and medical texts to jokes, newspapers and prints. The book also examines how disabled men and women drew on these representations in making sense of their own experiences via analyses of elite memoirs and letters and a variety of narratives produced by the disabled poor found in pauper letters, petitions and criminal court records. It challenges dominant historical assumptions about the period as one which witnessed a transformation of perceptions of disability from one based on a 'religious' model to one based on medical understanding, by showing overlap between different modes of conceptualising impairment. It also challenges the accepted picture of the eighteenth century as a time insensitive and ill-adapted to bodily disability, contributing to wider discussions about Enlightenment society.\n\nThe research is of contemporary as well as historical importance. It makes an important contribution to the broader project of restoring disabled people to history, acting as a form of empowerment to a group that traditionally has been marginalised. Key debates about disability in the eighteenth century recur in the modern era. The public perception and treatment of disabled war veterans is a current issue in Britain as part of the wider debate about the continued viability of military intervention in Afghanistan. At the same time, concerns about 'fraudulent' claimants to disability benefits (which echo eighteenth-century diatribes against 'sham cripples' begging on the streets) have resurfaced in the British media in the context of controversy about eligibility to state welfare provision. This research has potential to make an impact on policy debates about eligibility for support by examining the historical problems of defining genuine and fake claimants to relief. It draws on historical evidence to urge policy makers not to pander to media prejudices in their perception of what is 'disabling' and in judging the legitimacy of claimants. An article aimed at communicating 'lessons from history' to policy makers will demonstrate the relevance of the research in this respect. The resulting publications will appeal to scholars of disability history, eighteenth-century social and cultural history and anyone interested in human diversity.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal non-academic beneficiaries of this research will be disabled people, their families, carers and allies, and policy makers concerned with disability and equality.\n\nDisabled persons account for a substantial number of people in Britain today. Although calculations of the size of the disabled population depend on the definition of disability used, it has been estimated that there are over 11 million disabled adults in Britain, about 20% of the total population. Knowledge of the historical roles and experiences of disabled people is important for understanding processes of change and for meeting the needs of disabled people in Britain today and in the future, not just by highlighting the 'mistakes' of previous generations in their treatment of disability, but also by exploring how disabled people themselves fashioned their identities in the past and met the challenges facing them. Disability history has the potential to give a voice to a marginalised group, empowering them by giving their concerns and status historic roots. For example, the proposed research represents a departure from standard histories of physical anomaly in the pre-modern past which have customarily focused on the exotic or monstrous aspects of disability, and emphasised sources which interpreted disability as a divine punishment for sin, by showing how this was not the only paradigm through which disability was understood. By providing a more varied perspective on disability that incorporates the testimonies of disabled people themselves this research will have an impact on the ongoing construction of disabled people's lives and identities, helping to counter ingrained cultural prejudices against disability by showing that there was not an inevitable link between disability and 'freakery'. \n\nThe research has contemporary relevance as well as historical importance. The public perception and treatment of disabled war veterans is a current issue in Britain as part of the wider debate about the continued viability of military intervention in Afghanistan. At the same time, concerns about 'fraudulent' claimants to disability benefits (which echo eighteenth-century diatribes against 'sham cripples' begging on the streets) have resurfaced in the British media and this looks likely to remain an important area of policy debate over the next few years as politicians look to make cuts in public spending. This research has potential to make an impact on policy debates about eligibility for support by examining the historical problems of defining genuine and fake claimants to relief. It does so by showing that policy makers should not pander to media prejudices in their perception of what is 'disabling' and in judging the legitimacy of claimants.\n\nThe impact of the research will be achieved via effective communication of its findings to audiences of disabled people and policy makers. I am a member of the Disability History Group which exists to provide a public forum for disability research, disseminating the findings of research to an audience of academics, disabled people and caregivers via its website and conferences. Findings of research already undertaken for this project have been presented at the group's inaugural conference in 2007 and further findings will be disseminated at its conference in 2010. Press releases will publicise the research to the general public, especially to disabled groups via the disability press. In addition to the academic monograph that will be the project's key output, a shorter article will be prepared and submitted to the online journal, History and Policy, examining the issue of 'fraudulent' disability in historical perspective. This journal exists to present the findings of historical research to a wider audience of politicians and policy makers and publication here will ensure that the policy implications of the rese</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64751</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Disability: A New History</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02A2B0BA-23DB-43AA-BCC6-BA180A63BAC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was designer and academic adviser on a ten part series for BBC Radio 4, 'Disability: A New History' broadcast 27 May to 7 June 2013. I worked with the producer, Elizabeth Burke, Loftus Media, and the presenter Peter White to devise content for all ten episodes which used my book, 'Disability in Eighteenth-Century England' (Written using this AHRC funding) as its main point of reference. I provided expert interviews for four of the ten programmes, suggested other speakers, provided source materials which were read by actors and guided interpretation throughout. The series reached an average of 2.6 million listeners and resulted in free downloadable podcasts and transcriptions being made available. It received critical acclaim in the national press and was shortlisted as Research Project of the Year in the 2014 Times Higher Education Awards.

The series attracted much discussion in the press and social media. On Twitter several disability campaigners and organisations such as Remploy debated questions raised by the series, such as whether disabled performers in the eighteenth century were exploited or entrepreneurs - a theme addressed in episode 3. Some in the disability community tweeted about how the series had empowered them by allowing them to imagine their lives through the ages. The Daily Telegraph (29 May 2013) marveled at the 'surprising amount of documentary evidence' revealed by the series, while the Observer (2 June 201) noted how the series created a new kind of history because 'the disabled have never really featured in our stories of ourselves'. I received correspondence from the public asking for further information and assisted in the deposit of an important source relating to the disabled artist Matthew Buchinger (1674-1739) in the Wellcome Library.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-362235764.378901360cc1b750</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b021mdwt</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Form or Function?

It resulted in the completion of a 92,000 word book manuscript for Routledge with publication due in April 2012. Its main findings were as follows:



1. The project examined meanings of disability via a study of language, asking how far functional impairment was delineated from other forms of bodily aberration. It found that the terms 'disabled' and 'able-bodied' were used in this period, but they were not yet viewed as fundamental categories of identity based on universal standards of function or appearance. 'Disabled' was most often used in a narrower sense than today to refer to men wounded in battle. There was significant overlap between concepts of disability and deformity and languages of physical difference were significant to the wider ordering of eighteenth-century society, being used in discussions of social class and racial 'othering'. 



2. It challenged conventional historical thinking that during the eighteenth century there was a wholesale shift in perceptions of disability from 'religious' to 'medical' frameworks of understanding. It found that both religious and medical models were important to making sense of physical impairment in this period and often complemented each other. In the religious sphere the notion that disability was a punishment for sin was challenged by the view that disability was a potentially virtuous condition that brought a person closer to God through stoic bearing with affliction. Nevertheless, ideas of parental 'blame' continued in medical literature, for instance in texts that explained childhood disabilities such as rickets as the consequence of poor diet or parental licentiousness.



3. The project also examined the impact of concepts of politeness and sensibility by asking how far attitudes towards disability were influenced by a more 'modern' understanding based on compassion and accommodation of difference. In spite of new codes of conduct that proscribed staring at others' afflictions and a raft of philanthropic initiatives, sympathy towards people with disabilities could not be taken for granted and many people continued to view disability as a source of entertainment or cruel humour or viewed the display of impairments with suspicion that they might be feigned. 



4. Nevertheless, in spite of this, there were a number of challenges to conventional thinking about disability, including autobiographical writing, self-portraits and a variety of personal testimonies from people with disabilities from all social backgrounds. 



5. The project used personal testimonies produced by the disabled poor found in court records and poor law materials to examine the family experiences and working lives of people with various impairments. It showed how the family functioned as a caring environment, but disability could put families under strain both emotionally and economically.



6. Throughout the research, it was found that perceptions and experiences of disability were shaped by class and gender. Those further down the social scale were far more vulnerable to the economic consequences of disablement, while for men disability might bring a double loss of identity as breadwinner and head of the patriarchal household.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has a number of non-academic potential uses:



1. Findings of the research have a bearing on public policy and media debates about disabilty and welfare, particularly the ways in which claimants have been viewed as 'deserving' or 'undeserving' of assistance. The work shows that sympathetic attitudes towards disability have often been selective, with some disabled 'types' (such as children or soldiers wounded in heroic national service) being deemed more worthy of compassion than others. This has a direct bearing on current debates about welfare reform and highlights the long history of mistrust of the disabled poor. I have discussed this aspect of the research in my article for History and Policy (see outputs).



2. The research explores an aspect of human experience that is ubiquitous, but has not yet reached a wider audience. It is relevant to disabled people and their families interested in treatment of disability in previous centuries, to medical and social care professionals evaluating different approaches to disability, and to the wider public. Disability is something that potentially affects everyone. It is relevant to anyone coping wiht the life-altering consequences of accident, injury or chronic illness, or adapting to the fading sight, hearing and strength that accompany aging. Defined in these broad terms, disability history is therefore not just about an oppressed minority, but is also part of every family's history.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DC4894BB-4F25-446B-BF9C-D3F70911C57C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1358569107.3523545775e7056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FEA813A1-9D42-40E4-887B-A8779534FFE2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Technologies of the Body: Polite Consumption and the Correction of Deformity in Eighteenth-Century England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0e2d0947beef3a4da746fc9d89cbb670"><gtr:id>0e2d0947beef3a4da746fc9d89cbb670</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turner D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d800e4b376e6.39233733</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>65021EB1-264E-49A7-9796-73ED69CB945D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disability in Eighteenth-century England: Imagining Physical Impairment</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8ca24ee823665ef66626f7752b0d171"><gtr:id>b8ca24ee823665ef66626f7752b0d171</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turner David M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415886444</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_88575073923bf2953c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H039244/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
