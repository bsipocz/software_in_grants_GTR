However, bacteria (or germs) are becoming resistant to existing antibiotics. A rising number of patients are developing resistant infections for which there are limited antibiotics that work. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. When resistant bacteria cause pneumonia it is very difficult to treat. Patients may become distressed, have to stay in hospital longer, and in some cases, the infection can lead to death.
An extremely limited number of new and effective antibiotics for pneumonia have been developed over the past thirty years. This is because several drugs that appeared promising in the laboratory did not work as well as expected in patients. Of greatest concern is the fact that bacteria are quickly becoming resistant to the antibiotics we currently rely on. New antibiotics are urgently required for patients with resistant infections. This research will use state-of-the-art techniques to build tools to identify antibiotic dosages that are safe and effective for patients with pneumonia. By facilitating the accelerated development of precious new medicines, patients around the world will benefit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims 
The overall aim is to generate new knowledge of antibacterial concentration-time (C-T) profiles in subcompartments of the lung and how these relate to microbiological outcomes (bacterial kill and the suppression of resistance) by:
1. Exploring the consequences of using drug C-T profiles in plasma versus epithelial lining fluid (ELF) for planning regimens in early phase clinical studies for HAP.
2. Characterising the spatial distribution of meropenem in subcompartments of normal and infected lung.
3. Developing a semi-mechanistic physiology-based (PB) pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model to describe how PK differences in plasma, ELF and target tissue relate to microbiological outcomes.
Methodology
1. Dynamic in-vitro experiments will be conducted using a Hollow Fibre Infection Model to quantify how differential C-T profiles in plasma and ELF affect bacterial kill and the emergence of resistance. The clinical effectiveness of a new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor will be predicted by benchmarking its in-vitro efficacy at the level of plasma and ELF against meropenem.
2. PK-PD relationships will be evaluated using a murine model of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. Drug concentrations in plasma, ELF and lung homogenates will be quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Histology-guided high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) will characterise spatial distribution and provide a semi-quantitative estimate of meropenem metabolism in lung.
3. A PBPK model will be developed and combined with an experimental PK-PD model, illustrating the potential to predict the time course of bacterial kill and emergence of resistance at clinically relevant sites for HAP.
Scientific opportunities
This Fellowship will build tools to accelerate the successful development of new antibacterial drugs for patients with pneumonia that are safe, effective and reduce the emergence of resistance</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267269</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R016895/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
