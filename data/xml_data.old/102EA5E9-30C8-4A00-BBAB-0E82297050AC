However they have been affected by radical changes in global retail trends and public sector cuts which are relegating them to a marginal space. At the same time, markets specialising in food, local produce, fashion and crafts, aimed at high income consumers and tourists are in resurgence with Borough in London and La Boqueria in Barcelona held as successful models. Research is urgent to understand the current situation of markets and their potential community value which may be at risk as evidenced by the rise of campaigns, particularly in London, denouncing the displacement of independent retailers and vulnerable users. 
To respond to this knowledge gap and need for policy advice, this research will provide a fresh, novel and holistic way to understand the community value, which so far has been evidenced in international academic and policy literature but remains disconnected. For our research we will define the community value of TRM as constituted of three interconnected dimensions: 1. Economic as places that provide affordable food, products and services as well as create opportunities for low cost business start-ups. 2. Social as platforms for social mobility and the development of community ties and trust leading to better social inclusion. 3. Cultural as spaces for experiencing a diversity of cultures and ethnicities and provide a sense of place for migrants, ethnic minorities and generally vulnerable citizens. 
The project will be organised around four tasks. First we will critically analyse how the current public discourse around TRM is being framed nationally and internationally through an analysis of industry, academic, community, media and policy publications. Second, in collaboration with stakeholders through interviews and workshops, we will tease out the various ways in which key TRM stakeholders understand their community value. A third task will gain an in depth and rigorous understanding of markets users' experiences via interviews, focus groups and a large market user survey in three markets which we have selected as Sheffield Moor, Stockport and Queens Market in London. These represent the profound transformations that TRM are going through in different ways: the three are based in dense urban areas with significant deprived pockets within their catchments, they are all owned and managed by local authorities with severe funding pressures but are at various stages of redevelopment. With the data from the large scale survey we will perform a geospatial analysis identifying the socio-demographic groups that market users come from at the different case studies and relating this to their various experiences. The fourth task will concentrate in the development of usable outputs and tools for key TRM stakeholders such as market trader organisation, local authorities, national level policy makers, third sector organisations and local community groups all engaged in the future of TRM. 
To extend our potential to have a real societal impact we will co-produce our research with non-academic partners from the TRM sector (National Market Traders Federation) and experts in community economics (New Economics Foundation) and we will be supported through a Steering Group with other organisations at various stages of the research (See letters). The project will result in five academic articles in international journals. We will produce reports aimed at policy makers within the TRM sector and accessible short reports and non-academic articles all disseminated through our communication strategy. We will also hold practical workshops with traders, market managers and community groups to test and feedback on our findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit all of those with responsibilities in the TRM sector as well as current and potential market users and members of the public in general. In particular: 

Market Traders: There are around 55,000 people directly employed by TRM, half of them organised around the nation-wide National Markets Traders Federation (NMTF), Co-Is in this proposal, which has 23,000 members. They support traders on the ground, lobby government for the improvement of conditions in the sector and campaign widely to raise the profile of markets. Traders, through dedicated workshops, reports and non-academic publications, will benefit by having rigorous evidence about the socio-economic value that their jobs bring, promoting their sector to government bodies and the public in general. 

Market operators and managers: There are around 1,226 TRM in the UK many of them organised around the National Association of British Market Authorities (NABMA) which has around 200 members and which supports our proposal (See letters). There are also private international operators such as Geraud and a new London Markets Board. These stakeholders are represented in the All Party Parliamentary Group on Markets (APPG) which is supportive of this project (See letters). At our case study markets, through dedicated workshops and reports, managers will benefit by the evidence generated from customer surveys thus giving them more information about their customer base. Nationally, via policy reports, workshops and presentations, operators will benefit from the policy tools to enhance the community value of markets, replicable for their own markets. These insights will support their activities aimed at showing the added value of this sector vis a vis corporate supermarkets at a time of increased competition and shrinking public budgets. 

Market campaigns and community local groups: There are many campaigns emerging in the UK bringing together market users and traders to stop the neglect, disappearance or gentrification of their markets, such as Friends of Queens Market, Save Chrisp Street Market, Save Berwick Street Market, Wards Corner Community Coalition (all in London), Friends of Leeds Kirkgate Market or Friends of Peterborough Market with whom the PI is in direct contact. Campaigners will benefit by having rigorous data and a methodology, disseminated in reports, workshops and short publications, to evidence the community value of markets, which they campaign for, particularly in processes of urban regeneration when TRM are often under threat. 

National level public officials / policy makers. The Department for Communities and Local Government and Department for Business and Innovation have direct responsibilities over markets as well as the Future High Streets Forum, the Association of Town Centre Management, Royal Town Planning Institute or Local Government Association. Through targeted dissemination of our policy reports and in a final project event, these policy makers will be shown a complex and holistic understanding of the value of TRM thus improving their knowledge in important decisions. 

Market users and members of the public in general. It is estimated that there are 26 billion shopping visits to TRM each year (NABMA and NMTF, 2016) and they contribute to the economic and cultural life of towns and cities thus TRM are an important part of many people's lives. Through a carefully planned communication strategy involving social and traditional media, we will disseminate our findings to a wide audience spreading awareness of the community value of TRM which can impact on decisions over the promotion and improvement of markets. The most vulnerable groups will particularly profit by our evidence as policy makers' will have tools to tailor their policies towards them. In the case study markets, users will benefit from finding out more about the community role of their markets impacting on their pride and sense of place.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>485878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010547/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E531E0AA-923F-4B08-BC17-0B51B22FCA38</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Recreation/Tourism Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
