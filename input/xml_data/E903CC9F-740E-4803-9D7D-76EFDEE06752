The improved mobile-based supervision and training will link CHWs more closely to the local primary healthcare system so as they can be more effective in reducing poverty through improving the access of local communities to health care.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this activity?
The project's research questions address five groups of beneficiaries. The three direct beneficiaries will be: (i) the 64 CHWs and (ii) 8 supervisors directly involved in the project and (iii) AMREF in Kenya. The two indirect beneficiaries will be (iv) the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MOPHS) and (v) the communities the CHWs serve in Makueni County and the Kibera informal settlement in Southern Nairobi.

How will they benefit from this activity?
(i) CHWs will benefit from increased communication with their supervisors thus improving their integration with the local primary healthcare system. 
(ii) Supervisors will also benefit from the improved communication links and will be able to better tailor their support to CHWs as they will have asynchronous access to CHWs' personal practice data (including the points where they requested help) for the first time. 
(iii) For AMREF the main benefits will be (a) access to a grounded dataset to better understand and analyse CHWs learning needs (b) an evidence-base of how CHW service delivery is improved by the intervention and (c) specifics of the on-the-ground support structures needed for intervention implementation.
(iv) The Kenyan MOPHS will benefit from iterative policy briefings on the role of mobile learning in CHW supervision and training, inputting into specific implementation strategies at community level.
(v) The communities in Makueni County and Kibera will benefit from improved access to health care.

What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this activity?
(i) In order to build capacity at the NGO level, the project researchers will share their research methods expertise and AMREF staff will be encourage to take part in data analysis according to their skills and interests. 
(ii) In support of this training, two members of AMREF staff will undertake a two capacity-building trips to the IoE.
(iii) The participatory action research (PAR) approach ensures that CHWs and their supervisors will be participants in the entire research process, with the priorities of CHWs and their supervisors addressed through genuine collaboration and the co-construction of knowledge.
(iv) The stakeholder inception workshop, held at month 1, will ensure that the project is fully grounded in the local context and focuses on the poverty-relevant practices of CHWs. 
(v) The mobile application wil be made freely available under a creative commons licence.
(vi) Findings will be reported back to all participants in appropriate formats (e.g. story narratives and case studies) using venues arranged through the support of local community organisations.

The legacy of the research will be managed building on the expertise of AMREF in developing their nurse training eLearning programme in a public-private partnership with Accenture, the Nursing Council of Kenya and the MOPHS and then passing it over to the Nursing Council to scale-up and run independently. We will learn from and build on this strategy for seeking wider use and uptake of our mobile learning intervention as opportunities arise.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>417352</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Amref Health Africa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Amref</gtr:description><gtr:id>A61D996F-0F77-4DD7-BF10-6CF054ECB00C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>see relevant sections of the form</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56aa4b37d4acf6.50375226-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Set up the fieldwork, with our involvement, and kept the relationships on the ground in Kenya going while we were not in the country.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Kenyan collaborator - in charge of liasing on the ground with community health workers and the Kenyan Ministry of Health</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The impact of mobile technologies on education in low- and middle-income countries: A mixed-methods systematic review</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FBB9C63E-2C3C-4120-B3F3-926FEDF10990</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion of early work on the results of the first systematic review undertaken of mobile leanring in development.

It addressed this by developing an accessible mobile learning intervention that encouraged more supportive supervision and helped to link this more closely to CHW practice. This consisted of three inter-related parts: Mobile webapps, face-to-face training and community support. 

The project generated significant new knowledge in the following areas: 

1. How to use a participatory action research approach to develop mHealth applications for CHWs and their supervisors (known as community health extension workers, or CHEWs) working in low-resource settings;
2. How a protocol for the assessment of child development stages can be used for decision support by CHWs as part of a mobile app. Aligned to this, the project showed how mobile messaging apps (i.e. Whatsapp) can be used for mentorship and improved social support;
3. How to develop mobile apps that support the professional development of CHWs, moving beyond a simple information acquisition model of learning to one focused on successful social participation;
4. How mobile-based supervision and training can be successfully embedded within the existing structures of community-based care;
5. How a 'theory of change' approach to evaluation can be used to detail the ways in which CHW and supervisor actions are changed by the addition of a mobile app to their practice.

Two mobile webapps were developed in consultation with paediatricians in Kenya and in the UK: the REFER app and the ALPHA app. 
? The REFER app built capacity by teaching 100 community health workers the skills of how to assess the motor, cognitive and social development of children under five. The app enabled supervisors to provide feedback on the CHWs' assessments and practices, so as to enhance their skills and improve their performance. This was the first time that these CHWs were trained in skills around the developmental assessment of children. 
? The second app, ALPHA, allowed supervisors and Public Health Officers to design their own mobile training apps, without the need to code.
For the marginalised communities of Makueni County and the Kibera informal settlement in Nairobi, the project resulted in:
? Improved access to primary and community-based health care for children with disabilities and their families;
? Training of CHWs and CHEWs in assessing child development in under-5s, resulting in the identification of over 40 families with a disabled child. Neither CHWs nor CHEWs had received any training on the development of children under five prior to the project. In addition, both CHWs and CHEWs received training in the use of smartphones;
? CHW, CHEW and household knowledge of the development milestones of children under five has increased substantially;
? Through workshops on child development and disability, the supervision and mentorship skills of CHEWs have been improved;
? Improved referral decision-making by CHWs, resulting in more efficient use of medical time and resources. 

Project partnership supported capacity building, through community exchange visits, and training for Amref researchers in the UK. This enabled the research in mHealth to inform practice in the Kenyan context.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The next step to take forward this work is to understand how mobile interventions in health care training can be better linked to broader conceptualisations of poverty alleviation. While most measures of poverty alleviation focus on income, research in development studies has consistently shown that trying to understand poverty alleviation by focusing on economic measures alone ignores the bigger picture. Work remains to be done on using this broader conceptualisation to inform the evaluation of mHealth interventions as tools for poverty alleviation.

The role of mHealth interventions in addressing the &amp;quot;treatment gap&amp;quot;, where health services only reach a very small minority of those in low-income settings, remains an under-explored area. There is great potential in partnering with health workers and hospitals to explore how this can be addressed by investigating the take-up of mHealth interventions at scale in real-word settings. 

With respect to policy, and in response to the call from the Ministry of Health in Kenya, a welcome next step would be support for more co-ordination between mHealth research projects so they can pool their findings, resources and expertise. In particular, expertise on transferring combined research findings from funded projects into high-level policy discussions would be welcome. This could be done with NGOs and the private sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C8EE3A18-9A08-4A84-8DD0-DECDFC483CA5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a8a2a65db4a6.50742030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.mchw.org/?page_id=14</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Smartphone app developed in collaboration with the study participants in this project.
