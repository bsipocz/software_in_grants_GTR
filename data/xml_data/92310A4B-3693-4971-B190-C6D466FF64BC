Since 1983 it has produced a series of films released annually in December and colloquially referred to as 'cinepanettoni' ('film-Christmas-cakes'). These might inexactly be compared to the British 'Carry On' films in their utilization of a regular cast of stock comic types, and of a broad sexual humour; however, they are remarkably hybrid texts which also feature, for example, thriller and travelogue elements in order to appeal to a variegated public. The films have been successful enough to have become part of the annual festive rituals for large numbers of Italians, and have spawned offshoots as star actors are employed to produce copycat films; the industry is now attempting to generate an equivalent series of films for the summer season.\nDespite its success, the genre remains unstudied, and has suffered a critical disdain from those representing authoritative film criticism and scholarship. Few Italians with a degree will admit to having watched a 'cinepanettone'; indeed, the films are seen as symptomatic or even partly causative of the election of successive right-wing governments. This attitude is self-evidently inadequate to the analysis of a complex phenomenon with discernable roots in Italian film tradition. It also suggests that the study of the 'cinepanettone' genre offers a set of challenges to scholarship, because of the hybrid character of the texts themselves, because of the complex manner of their consumption, and perhaps most of all, as a consequence of the manner in which they have traditionally been received (and denigrated) by right thinking people in Italy and in Italian studies.\nMy working outline for the book project is as follows: \n1. analysis of the body of films from synchronic and diachronic perspectives, and in terms of form and content\n2. analysis of the genre's relationship to Italian film history and other national productions (especially France)\n3. analysis of the industrial context (production and distribution), and of the personnel, including an analysis of the place of actors/stars\n4. analysis of the consumption, utilization and circulation of these films by their audience(s)\n5. consideration of the place of these films in relation to critically privileged forms of Italian cinema, and to the concept of 'national' cinema per se\nMy model for the form of the book will be the British Film Institute's classics series, though its content will be in explicit opposition to the guiding principles of that series (not least in that I will be dealing with a genre rather than a single text).\nWhy is this project important? Anthropology tells us that the repetitive character of genre production is a refraction of the foundational aspects of human culture; at the same time, genre can mediate and elaborate 'traumatic' challenges to the social structure. The study of the 'cinepanettone' is, therefore, at one level a significant anthropological and social study, and requires instruments drawn from those fields. At the same time, the very success of these films augurs their intrinsic interest. The project is also intended to euthanatize a tendentious but critically treasured perception that Italian cinema is a crude 'mirror' of the nation, and only those texts that explicitly address the question of identity are to be valued. The project may well offer a model for such benevolent euthanasia in other national contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I will maximise the social and economic impact of my research in the following ways:\n\nCollaboration with cinemas and film festivals: \nThe publication of the Holiday Pictures book in English will make an unfamiliar genre available to a UK public and raise questions about the nature and status of popular cinema genres in Italy and in the UK. I therefore propose:\nto approach the Bradford National Media Museum to organise a film season and/or study day devoted to popular genres in the UK and elsewhere\nto collaborate with the Leeds Hyde Park Cinema on the selection, presentation and projection of popular Italian films\nto approach the organisers of the Cambridge Film Festival to propose a season of cinepanettoni films at a future festival. Such a season would have associated study events open to the public, as well as invited speakers to introduce individual films. Producers and personnel associated with the films would also be invited.\n\nPresentations and provision of study material to students in secondary schools and others:\nAs admissions and widening participation officer for the Italian Department at Leeds I will present my research to groups in secondary schools in Yorkshire and further afield, and will invite schools to the university for study days. Students will also be invited to the events proposed above in collaboration with the Bradford Media Museum and the Cambridge Film Festival, and to the 'European Identities: Past and Present' lecture series, described below. \nI am developing at Leeds an introduction to Italian cinema studies web resource, and materials from my research into the cinepanettone will form a substantial part of this resource. The web resource will be available for use by schools and other education institutions, as well as by the general public. \n\nPresentations to interested societies and the general public: \nOne of the aims of this project to foster understanding of the place of conventionally despised forms of entertainment in a national culture. The conclusions I arrive at in relation to Italy will be relevant also to the UK. I will therefore be presenting this research to the general public via at least the following forums: \nItalian Societies. For example, in May 2010 I will be presenting my work to the Voglia d'Italia group, the Italian society for South Yorkshire and North Notts.\nI will be giving a talk on Italian cinema and national identity as part of the public lecture series 'European Identities: Past and Present' run in spring 2010 at the Uni. of Leeds. \n\nPotential benefit to the UK economy:\nI expect the publication of the Holiday Pictures book in Italian to be a controversial event which will lead to invitations from media and universities to discuss the research (as was the case with my previous monograph. I will be presenting the book in bookshops, libraries and other forums. This will have the effect of encouraging Italian students to apply to Leeds for graduate study, as well as enhancing the reputation of Leeds and the UK for world leading research. \nMy book will add to our understanding of the role of popular forms in sustaining a struggling cinema industry (a description that applies to the British as well as the Italian industry). In contributing to the debate about the structure of the British cinema industry I would expect to influence to a small degree the formation of policy on the public funding of film production.\nThrough the film festival initiatives outlined above I hope to facilitate contact between representatives of the film industries in Italy and the UK. There is a tradition of European co-production in Italy, and British actors and technicians have found employment in the Italian industry even in recent years. I hope that the activities generated by my research will encourage co-production or other collaboration between individuals and entities in th</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28305</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Impact of film festival programming and media debate.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BEEF420C-406F-4F20-81B1-44362D489BB7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b89bf3029603.14210208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Italian film industry has often been pronounced moribund but has always survived by providing critically despised films for a popular audience. Since the early 1980s, irregularly at first and then annually, it has produced a series of comedies with titles like Vacanze di Natale '90 (Enrico Oldoini, 1990) and Natale a Rio (Neri Parenti, 2008), released in time for Christmas and colloquially referred to as 'cinepanettoni'. In Italian film studies, as in journalistic discourse, the cinepanettone has become a byword for low quality and a metonym for the degradation of Italian film culture. The traditional suspicion of the popular (in the sense of mass culture) in culturally authoritative circles in Italy itself has meant that the cinepanettone remains almost unstudied. Italian cinema studies remains wedded to the notion of a 'national' cinema, where the 'national' is conceived of as a kind of diplomatic project to be presented abroad, and genre and popular filmmaking (and film-going) is still seen as inauthentic and pernicious. Though constantly berated for their superficiality the cinepanettoni seem for their detractors to be far more than mere films: they are discursive tokens employed in the contested self-definition of Italy and Italians.

Another way to put this is to say that the cinepanettoni deserve the status of a revised category of 'Italian national cinema'. The cinepanettone constitutes Italian national cinema because of its consumption almost exclusively within Italy itself as part of annual holiday ritual. In its carnivalesque celebration of socially inappropriate behaviour and values the cinepanettone offers, precisely, a sense of community, of home, as the cinema audience enjoys the antics of its fellow Italians in a liminal suspended space, typically abroad. 

For many the cinepanettoni are this shared celebration; for others, the very idea these films could speak to, of or for 'us' is appalling. This conflict of feelings should not be dismissed, for it is exactly its controversial character that has allowed the cinepanettone to exemplify the constructive and contested process of imagining the national community. The popularity of the form may have faded, but the scale and longevity of the cinepanettone's intra-national success indicates its role as a key site for questioning what it means to be Italian.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Application to other periods in Italy, or to other national
