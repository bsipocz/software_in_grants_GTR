This project will examine how marginalized groups such as indigenous people enact the right to have rights through practices of insurgent citizenship. In this context, the project will address a practical and a conceptual paradox.\n\nThe practical paradox concerns how best to understand the politics of human rights exemplified in the struggle of the Aboriginal tent embassy in Australia. The movement for Aboriginal sovereignty began in Australia in 1972 when several young indigenous men claimed to establish an embassy in front of Parliament House on behalf of the Aboriginal nation. In this demonstration, immanent outsiders to a polity (indigenous people) claimed a right that they did not have within existing practices of citizenship. Human rights are commonly viewed as universal entitlements that we have as human beings irrespective of our membership in a particular political community. But the demonstration of Tent Ambassadors seem to reverse this common sense: the protesters demonstrate their universal entitlement as human beings by both insisting on their status as 'aliens' within the Australian polity and acting as if they are citizens of a Sovereign Aboriginal Nation.\n\nThe conceptual paradox follows from this and concerns the paradox that Arendt's notion of the right to have rights gives rise to. Arendt's prescient analysis of the perplexities of the rights of man, published just after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, seemed to show that it is only by virtue of citizenship that we have any rights at all. In inter-war Europe, stateless people found themselves in precisely the situation in which they needed to invoke their human rights. Yet they were effectively rightless. Consequently, Arendt claimed that the only true human right is the right to have rights. But this leads to the question in what sense those who become rightless (by virtue of being excluded from citizenship) might claim the right to have rights. The project will address this paradox by examining how Arendt's analysis of the right to have rights has been developed within three paradigms in contemporary political theory, exemplified in the work of Seyla Benhabib (Frankfurt school), Giorgio Agamben (Heideggerian) and Jacques Ranci&amp;egrave;re (post-Marxist).\n\nThe project will analyse the languages and practices through which immanent outsiders invoke human rights to engage in acts of insurgent citizenship. The study of languages will inquire into what can be said. It will do so by investigating Arendt's conception of the right to have rights and how it has been interpreted in contemporary political theory. The study of practices will inquire into what can be done. It will investigate the strategies of insurgent citizenship exemplified by the Tent Ambassadors and their impact on the practices of citizenship they contest. Rather than distinguishing sharply between theory and practice, the specialized discourse of political theorists and the political activism of the social movements will be treated as different aspects of generalized political thinking ('the political') that is the proper object of reflection of a political theory of politics.\n\nA workshop will be held in Canberra to engage Aboriginal activists and scholars in the project. The main outcomes will be a sole-authored monograph and a co-edited book (with Shino Konishi, ANU), including a contributing chapter and co-authored introduction.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit activists involved with the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Australia by deepening our understanding of the nature of their political activity and the effectiveness of their strategies. The project will provide an opportunity for activists to develop links with academics through participation in the workshop. It will also provide institutional resources for activists to reach a broader audience through the public conference that will be held in Canberra following the fellowship. The project will ensure that activists associated with the Tent Embassy protest and the Working Group for Aboriginal Rights benefit from the research by actively involving them from the outset and by providing them with an opportunity to address both an academic and broader popular audience.\n\nThe research will also benefit human rights activists and organizations more generally. The theory of human rights that the project aims to develop has the potential to benefit human rights activists more broadly by providing a new vocabulary in which to articulate and develop strategies for social transformation. The project aims to maximize the impact of the research findings by presenting them at a public conference to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Tent Embassy.\n\nThe research will benefit the wider public by deepening our understanding of the nature of democratic citizenship and its relation to the politics of human rights. We commonly understand ways of being political in terms of the dominant representation of citizenship by ruling groups in society. This project will deepen our understanding of practices of citizenship by demonstrating how they are dependent on the immanent outsiders they exclude. It will also enrich our understanding of citizenship by demonstrating how immanent outsiders contest and transform the self-understanding of citizens though enacting the right to have rights. Moreover it will challenge our prevailing humanitarian view of the politics of human rights.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>53655</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Film and Sound Archive (Australia)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Screening of Ningla A-Na and recording of interviews</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8CA3EBF-FD69-449D-AD28-7C39A0F9C2F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The panel discussion was recorded by the NFSA and made publicly available.

The Symposium held on 20-22 June 2011 was covered by local and national radio. This included reports and interviews with participants for local radio stations in Canberra. It also includes two documentaries for national radio: 'Fire in the Belly' by Toni Hassan for Awaye, ABC Radio National, aired on 10 December 2011 and The Aboriginal Embassy Symposium by Rebecca George for The Wire, Independent Radio, 24 June 2011. Andrew Schaap was a guest on 'Fire First', 3CR community radio programme on Aboriginal affairs. The programme broadcast 1972 recordings of speeches made at the Aboriginal Embassy discovered during archival research for the project. Andrew discussed the significance of the recordings with Robbie Thorpe and Claire Land. The media coverage surrounding this event helped to place the Embassy within the public consciousness in Australia in the lead up to the fortieth anniversary on 26 January 2012. The impact of the symposium on the media was to reflect a deeper understanding of the social, historical and political significance of the Embassy and the reasons why it remains in Canberra. The academic context of the symposium provided a setting in which political actors were able to reflect on their achievements and to discuss contemporary political challenges. It provides a forum in which the achievements of an older generation of political actors could receive public recognition and knowledge and wisdom could be passed on to younger generations and the wider community.

2. On the basis of this research project, I was invited to present a keynote lecture at the Annual Conference on Radical Democracy, which is convened by graduate students at the New School for Social Research and Cornell University. This lecture presented both the theoretical and empirical findings of the research to an international audience. It served to inform participants about the struggle for indigenous rights in Australia, allowing for comparison with indigenous struggle in other parts of the world, especially South America. The paper also provoked reflection on the place of First Peoples within the theory and practice of radical democracy.

3. My research findings have also been engaged with by another AHRC-funded project on Diplomatic Cultures. I was invited to present my research findings from this project at a workshop on Alternative cultures of diplomacy in The Hague on 8-9 November 2013, which included the participation of Foreign Office and was hosted by the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation (UNPE).

4. I was further invited to contribute a chapter on the relation between the Aboriginal Embassy and Australian citizenship for the Routledge Handbook of Global Citizenship, for dissemination to a non-academic audience.

5. I was invited to participate as a international collaborator on an Australian Research Council project on Resistance, Recognition and Reconciliation in Australia (2013-2015). My role in the project will be to consider the implications of my findings about the significance of the Aboriginal Embassy for the contemporary political debate about recognition of Aboriginal peoples within the Australian constitution.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9FE1BE51-2E83-49E6-A566-FD398D42CA6B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-3090530441.226932de287320</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C389AE8-BE28-4502-B104-7D1B92C99F74</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aboriginal Sovereignty and the Politics of Reconciliation: The Constituent Power of the Aboriginal Embassy in Australia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning D: Society and Space</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/825a6df96b42e49687d3e9d7ff51ae27"><gtr:id>825a6df96b42e49687d3e9d7ff51ae27</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Muldoon P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d039039563a26d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD803B3F-2587-4A67-81B2-BF57A6213FC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Jacques Ranciere in the Contemporary Scence: The Philosophy of Radical Equality</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/834241332221744bf476701ad892081f"><gtr:id>834241332221744bf476701ad892081f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schaap A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 9781441114099</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54687646b50751.74440569</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B9B07CF-C839-4D86-84E7-15328E1BA73E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Human Rights and the Political Paradox</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Australian Humanities Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/834241332221744bf476701ad892081f"><gtr:id>834241332221744bf476701ad892081f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schaap A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546875360be4a8.91237910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>766DECA0-9648-4266-B055-3FA2990859F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Aboriginal Tent Embassy and Australian Citizenship</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11f1a098812e20ab47af42e69d71c684"><gtr:id>11f1a098812e20ab47af42e69d71c684</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howell E &amp;
