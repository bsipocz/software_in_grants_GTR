Studies to date have examined only one or two parts of the ?citizenship process?, meaning the tests themselves, the citizenship ceremonies, the preparation courses many immigrants take beforehand, as well as the consequences of the tests for those to whom it is addressed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will adopt a more comprehensive approach to these issues, examining the lived experiences of the citizenship process as a whole via interviews with people about their experiences with preparation courses and their participation in the citizenship tests and ceremonies in Leicester and London. To analyse the effects of the process on the longer term, statistical analysis of survey data will also be undertaken. The overall goal is to learn about immigrants' perceptions and experiences of this process, to understand how it affects their sense of belonging, political participation and subjective well-being (happiness).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate three areas of impact:
- increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy: by assessing the quality of services and policy, connecting the needs of policy-makers, service-providers and users involved in the citizenship process
- enhancing quality of life and wellbeing: by improving migrants' understanding of the citizenship process
- improving social cohesion: by increasing awareness of different groups (and the public at large) of consequences of the citizenship process

Project results will demonstrate individuals' and groups' needs in accessing the citizenship test, providers/organizers' understandings of learners' experiences, barriers to and examples of good practice in supporting learners, the long-term outcomes of this process and the extent to which intended objectives are achieved.

The following groups will benefit from and be interested in this work:

- Immigrant and refugee advocacy organisations and Immigrant groups:
The project will engage directly with migrants and organisations involved in the citizenship process including through community facilitators.
Problems organizations identified in discussions with the research team include: learning why people choose to take the test or not; what its impacts are and how different groups experience it; whether non-profit organisations should consider providing test preparation; and awareness of long-term impacts.
This engagement will ensure the policy relevance of the research by providing diagnosis of the needs and abilities of different migrant groups. It will also encourage reflexivity and challenge preconceptions of advocacy and service providers thereby feeding into longer term strategy and practice.

- Community colleges and other organizations that prepare individuals for citizenship tests, test centre officials, local government officials, UKBA, Home Office:
The project will contribute to an evidence base regarding the test-taking process that could prove influential in shaping how community colleges and other organizations prepare people to take the test. More broadly it will contribute to policy debates surrounding the value of the test and its role as a means of integration in the short and long-term, e.g. generating better understanding of different groups' experiences and perceptions of the tests and ceremonies; and assessing effectiveness of preparation and the test as a mechanism of inclusion.
At the end of project workshops we will discuss project results, provide participants with an opportunity to critically reflect on their everyday experience, facilitate the development of networks between different actors, provide an opportunity for users to comment on the practical implications of the research for their own work, identify further issues that research could investigate and develop collaborations for future policy-relevant research in partnership. These workshops will ensure impact beyond the life-span of the project among participants who will be drawn from the different groups listed above.

- Wider Public, Policy Actors:
The final non-specialist report and executive summary will enable us to engage with other groups beyond those participating directly in the project and after it is concluded. The report will present key findings and reflections from the academic and stakeholder workshops, and will outline the policy and practical implications of the research for individuals, groups and organisations involved in the 'citizenship process'.
A recent spate of articles on the citizenship test, focusing on its perceived difficulty and fairness suggests the research would be highly newsworthy and of interest to the wider public. Non-specialist publications through policy networks, think tanks (e.g. Institute for Public Policy Research) and media engagement through op-eds for general press in London and Leicester will enable us to reach policy actors and organisations, beyond the life span of the project</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>351276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with members of Greater London Authority Social Cohesion Team</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BBE934B0-4F58-4086-ABFB-76D4B7A199B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In December 2016, Leah Bassel met with members of the Greater London Authority Social Cohesion team who had participated in the September 2016 stakeholder workshops. Through this discussion Leah provided further information on the findings from the project. Key areas were identified that are of specific interest to the Social Cohesion team, whereby project findings could directly inform policy making and which would be useful to highlight in the final, non-specialist report. Further events at which project findings could be shared were also identified (requests for further involvement, plans for future activity).

Following the meeting Leah shared further sources that had been identified as relevant to the work of the team. Specifically, Leah sent her Discover Society article which responds to the Casey Review of Opportunity and Integration by drawing on the findings relating to women's experiences of the naturalisation process.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd4f20ad6de7.13124904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Undergraduate and Masters teaching drawing on the project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C1BD503-CFD1-41AD-8C51-3CACC49227C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project has generated teaching material for sessions in co-I Monforte's Ethnicity and Society Undergraduate module, and PI Bassel has lectured to MA students on research methods and fieldwork using the project as a case study.

Audience members reported surprise and interest in the findings from the project, particularly the difficulty of the test requirements and the length and complexity of the naturalisation process.
CARIS staff found the presentation to be quite effective in challenging preconceived notions about what is required to naturalise, and in providing information about the toll the process can take on different people (depending on nationality, gender, language proficiency).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98b4e69e769.49435939</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit and informal discussion with Islington Chinese Association, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4E12566-2AC7-4B2B-A028-F8CD42A5EE63</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On March 9 2017, Leah Bassel visited the Islington Chinese Association to share project results and discuss further dissemination strategies.

Many participants at this event worked directly with migrants engaged in the citizenship test process and reported that our findings both confirmed their own knowledge based on their professional practice and drew new issues to light e.g. the lack of clarity around requirements of the process ('good character') and the difference in pass rates by nationality. 

In addition to the audience reporting change in views and opinions, we were asked to circulate further information from our study (i.e. our final, non-specialist report) and participants expressed interest in attending our end-of-project final public debate on June 9 2017.

We will also explore the possibility of incorporating findings from the project in the learner curriculum. for adult learners who are exploring citizenship as well as acquiring English language skills at the College. This could generate a significant impact from the study beyond the lifespan of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd4cf7758fc3.71183218</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Doctoral Students at workshop: Migration in Interdisciplinary Perspective, University of Leicester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B83C70DB-E473-4B72-9359-CAB4410FB3B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On January 18, 2017, Leah Bassel, Pierre Monforte and David Bartram presented the project to 25 doctoral students and academic colleagues as part of an interdisciplinary workshop led by the Leicester Migration Network.

- in London on September 17 2016, hosted at CARIS Haringey 
- in Leicester on September 24 2017, hosted at The Race Equality Centre

Participants included:
- members of the research team
- representatives of local and city-level government bodies (e.g. Greater London Authority, Leicester City Council)
- politicians (e.g. local councillors)
- local and national third sector and advocacy organisations
- colleges providing language training and support to migrants undertaking the citizenship process
- migrant advocates
- migrants with direct experience of the citizenship process
- University of Leicester postgraduate students working in this field who assisted as notetakers and in drafting the workshop report

The workshops were designed to:
? Disseminate the findings of the study
? Understand workshop participants' views of the test, the process (including ceremony), and how it affects people;
? Consider how the project findings connect with knowledge and experiences of workshop participants, whether and how they think the research is relevant and needed;
? Identify appropriate next steps (including what should be done with the research, and what can be achieved). In particular, we sought feedback to shape our final, non-specialist report

The research team presented the background and objectives of the study, as well as the most significant research findings (please see powerpoint presentation available on project website). These different points were then discussed through general exchanges as well as through small group discussions.

The general response of the participant groups was that they were not surprised by the findings of the research. In fact most people validated the results and agreed that they were a good reflection of their experience.
Participants then considered the following issues:
? Many participants were surprised by some of the reasons why an applicant was denied the right to apply for citizenship (e.g. One potential applicant was denied to apply for citizenship due to failing to report a minor offense in the past).

? There was a further discussion on how ambiguous the rules of 'good character/behaviour' are. In this respect, it was argued that 'applicants should put everything down and let the officers decide', to reduce the rate of rejection. 

? Participants in one workshop argued that the 'good character' requirement was problematic, in particular for refugees who have entered/are currently entering the country 'irregularly' thus breaching immigration laws. They suggested that this would have a negative effect on their citizenship application.

? In this discussion the question of the cost of the test was raised again. Participants agreed with the findings that the test was a costly experience and lack of resources often has a negative impact on the applicants' citizenship application. Withdrawal of preparatory classes was perceived as narrowing down possibilities to gain knowledge.

? Language: The second workshop strongly expressed concerns about language being an impediment in completing the test successfully. 

Participants elaborated on these findings via a lively discussion by sharing their own stories and examples, in particular on the issues of language, cost and content of the test. They concluded that these are the key parameters that ought to be taken into consideration when designing the citizenship test since they can have direct implications for the success rates of applications.


Both workshops offered key insights into why this research is important and its impact.
? Participants agreed that the research may serve as a source of information, evidence and reference for the government by taking the findings to MPs. The research can serve as an evaluation of whether existing policy and practices need reviewing or changing - e.g. What constitutes 'Good character'? Is the citizenship process an elitist/unfair policy? For some the research can help to improve the process by informing it so that there can be a reduction in the number of failures. For others the study highlights the experiences of their clients, from different parts of the world, some of whom have a harder time in the process and there is a need for data relating to this to be published (e.g. pass rates by nationality).

? As a follow up to this need for data that was identified, after the workshops the research team circulated the Migration Observatory 2015 report on naturalisation to all workshop participants. This report includes information about statistics on refusal on grounds of 'good character', which had been a central topic of discussion in both workshops. It can be accessed here: 
http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Briefing-Naturalisation.pdf

? Several participants also argued that research may be used to challenge the way the test is currently designed. Specifically, during the workshop it was proposed that: a) practical questions about life in the UK should be re-included in the test, as they help towards integration; b) the test lacks appropriate reference to colonisation and the &amp;quot;British Empire&amp;quot;, thus failing to represent adequately British history

? Several participants noted the importance of hearing migrants' voices through the study. They noted that the research serves to 'give voice' to people going through the process. They found that the project effectively captures the views and experiences that migrants have been feeding back to their organisations for years. This was described as 'powerful' because it enables the people working in these organisations to go back to the migrants they are supporting and tell them that their views are not unique, but part of a broader trend: '[the project] captures the views of many migrants', showing that they are not the only ones having these thoughts.'

? However, some participants suggested that the findings of this study cannot change existing sentiments of the British public. Citizenship can no longer guarantee integration due to the negative effect of recent events such Brexit and terrorist acts.

A workshop summary was then circulated to all participants (including those who were invited but not able to attend, which comprised many groups and organisations that were involved in the study) and other stakeholders. We invited feedback particularly to shape the drafting of our final, non-specialist report. The powerpoint presentation was also made available on our project website.

Outcomes and impacts: 
Following on from these workshops the project team has been invited to further present their work (requests about further participation or involvement, plans made for future related activity)
The team circulated key texts and information about the naturalisation process that were identified as useful to participants in the workshop (requests for further information)
Specific areas where research could directly contribute to participants' work were identified, to be discussed further (decision made or influenced, plans made for future related activity)

As a result of this presentation Bassel and Monforte have been invited to present project findings at the Evelyn Oldfield Unit, to migrants and refugees who are taking an accredited course to gain the skills and confidence to be able to research issues of refugee and migrant communities including education, training and employment, welfare and social concerns. 

Further possible opportunities were identified e.g. presenting research findings to members of the Kurdish community in north London.

The powerpoint presentation was also circulated to all group members, including those who were not able to attend the session.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd51ee1e5406.38293149</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We held two very well-attended stakeholder workshops in September 2016 and have since been presenting our findings to different groups that were directly involved in the project (see Engagement activities) as well as other stakeholders. Through this process we have been identifying the ways in which our findings can influence policy and practice (e.g. Greater London Authority and Leicester City Council, local councillors' work in Leicester and London, English language programmes and support for teacher and learners involved in English for Speakers of Other Languages provision).

This dissemination and consultation process in turn is feeding into our non-specialist report, shaping both its form and content. This process will be complemented by our public debate, held on June 9 2017 in Leicester, where project findings will be discussed and debates by academics, politicians, migrant rights activists and members of the public (please see 'Outputs &amp;amp; Knowledge/Future Steps' section). We aim to formally launch this report in Autumn 2017 and then work closely with a range of groups, including those identified above, to ensure impact beyond the lifespan of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>49228275-A4B1-4C42-968E-C09104C9D9C9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546098a3abb938.14390447</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is now in its final year. 

Data Collection:

All data have now been collected: 158 interviews were conducted with migrants of 39 nationalities, at different stages of the citizenship test process, in Leicester and London. These interviews have all been transcribed. Transcripts were then analysed using NVivo. The coding frame was developed over a period of 8 months, encompassing coding nodes that derived directly from the research questions as well as new, emerging themes. To ensure intercoder reliability transcripts were double (and even triple-) coded by several members of the project team. Transcripts were then recoded using the final coding frame and applying harmonized coding practice. Data analysis was intensive, with significant time allocated to this phase in order to ensure we fully exploited the insights from our large and diverse sample.

In addition, four focus groups were conducted with EU citizens in Leicester immediately prior to and after the June Brexit referendum. These focus groups have enabled us to explore understandings of naturalization and strategies adopted by this group in the current context.

Understanding Society data Wave 6 became available in December 2016, permitting quantitative analysis of political participation, belonging and well-being.

Key emerging findings:

Research Question 1: How do immigrants experience the citizenship process?

- Distinction processes: 
We have identified distinct processes through which some migrants draw a line between their own attitudes and behavior around naturalization and that of other migrants, thereby demonstrating that they have 'deserved' citizenship. Our findings thereby confirm existing studies on the turn toward 'earned' citizenship in migrants' experiences, and also explore the less-understood dimension of how some migrants themselves participate in reproducing these understandings of citizenship.

- Gender: 
Women are over-represented in our sample, with 94 female participants out of 158. This has provided the opportunity to focus on gender dimensions of experiences of naturalization. We find that the citizenship test process can exacerbate existing inequalities, particularly for women who are situated less favourably in hierarchies of 'race', class and nationality. 

- The Role of Negotiation: 
We explore the multiple political stances and reactions to the test process that our participants articulate. Drawing on this multiplicity we question the transformative intention of the process, but also complement figures in the naturalisation literature which tend to focus on one dimension, e.g. 'neoliberal citizens'. Instead we find that while many of these reactions are present, these approaches do not encompass the plurality of experiences. We propose a more nuanced figure: 'citizen-negotiators', socially situated actors who attempt to assert control over their lives as they navigate the test process and state power.

- The Brexit context: 
The analysis emerging from our focus groups and interviews shows how the Brexit referendum has affected how EU citizens living in the UK experience the citizenship test process. We explore how they construct new strategies of access to citizenship, which denote a perceived uncertainty about their future in the UK as well as a questioning of their position in society. At a more general level, we explore how their perception of citizenship in the Brexit context relates to their migration trajectories as well as to their specific position in the labour market.

Research Question 2: What are the consequences of the citizenship process on immigrants' sense of belonging and political participation?

- Political engagement and active citizenship: 
In many cases, participants describe or endorse their own understandings of 'active citizenship' in ways that do not refer to or accept the stated intentions of the citizenship test process, or draw on the materials and knowledge involved. We consider this disconnect to be significant and are exploring the extent to which 'active citizenship' connects meaningfully with the experiences of participants in our study.

Mixed methods analysis:

Using panel data from &amp;quot;Understanding Society&amp;quot;, we investigate interest/participation in politics among those who are non-citizens at Wave 1, comparing those who became citizens by Wave 6 to those who remained non-citizens. Analysis is underway to consider whether becoming a UK citizen (in part via meeting the requirements to pass the Life in the UK test and participate in a citizenship ceremony) is associated with an increase (or a decrease) in one's interest/participation in politics. This analysis is complemented by the qualitative data, which show how participants' interest in politics is not directly related to their experience of the citizenship test process.

Using panel data from &amp;quot;Understanding Society&amp;quot;, we also investigate sense of belonging among those who are non-citizens at Wave 1, comparing those who became citizens by Wave 6 to those who remained non-citizens. Through our qualitative analysis we find attachment to diversity alongside experiences of racism, and a 'horizontal' dimension to belonging understood in social terms (relating to fellow citizens and groups) as well as vertically to the nation. We show how the attachment to diversity becomes an object of negotiation on the part of EU citizens living in the UK in the context of Brexit. More generally, we show that the Brexit context exacerbates specific strategies of belonging on the part of EU citizens: strategies in which the construction of hierarchies of class and race is prominent.

Research Question 3: What are the consequences of the citizenship process on immigrants' subjective well-being (happiness)?

Analysis of Understanding Society data is in progress to consider whether becoming a UK citizen (in part via meeting the requirements to pass the Life in the UK test and participate in a citizenship ceremony) is associated with an increase (or a decrease) in one's subjective well-being (happiness).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see Other outputs/knowledge, future steps</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>50D34A16-EDB0-49C7-A517-75AD449CACF1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546098dff35285.20009991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/sociology/research/uk-citizenship-process/our-publications</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The research team is in the process of preparing and formatting the data so that anonymity and confidentiality will be secured before it is made available through the UK Data Service.
