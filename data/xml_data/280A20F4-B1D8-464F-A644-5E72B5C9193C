sector, driving much of the creative conceptualization for the mass-market sector. However, lack of time and resources in
the resource- and time-poor fashion and textile sector has inhibited R&amp;amp;D culture in fashion SMEs, weakening the UK
sector's ability to innovate and capitalize on invention, and retain competitive edge internationally. Increasing pressures
such as natural resource depletion, escalating consumption and waste, competition from overseas, and financial
fluctuations driven by the seasonal nature of designer fashion all strongly indicate that the current fashion business model
is unsustainable from both ecological and economic perspectives.
Collaborative research and development between fashion designers and university researchers has great potential in
addressing these issues, however this space is currently in its infancy.
Micro enterprises and SMEs have a poor understanding of university research, its potential benefits and available funding
opportunities. These businesses cannot allocate resource toward R&amp;amp;D beyond the inventive approaches applied but
seldom capitalized upon in designer fashion. University researchers often work in isolation from the sector, use a different
language and time frames that are not always compatible with industry needs and expectations.
FIRE.Digital addresses these issues by developing the first digital platform for research-focused UK network of fashion
SMEs and researchers. The key aim of the Platform is to galvanize collaborative research and innovation and provide
sustainable source of data on UK fashion SMEs and research network.
Building on the existing London-focused FIREup digital prototype (www.fireup.org.uk), FIRE.Digital will develop into a highend
online tool for a UK-wide network of fashion industry and researchers to connect via user-friendly online network, as
well as access curated fashion and textile research content, including news and funding opportunities.
FIRE.Digital will develop existing standard backend tools to create bespoke digital data collation and visualization tools and
methodologies, enabling capture of quantitative and qualitative data from the registered users. This data will provide
significant insights into the structure of fashion SMEs, positioning of fashion and textile researchers, UK Fashion network
formations, digital behavior in fashion SME's and researchers, barriers to collaborative research and open innovation in the
UK fashion industry and lead towards establishing new research topics. These tools could potentially find application in
wider creative industry research context.
FIRE.Digital strategic and technical elements will be developed in collaboration with a Digital Agency. FIRE Focus Group,
consisting of designer fashion and textile SMEs and researchers, will be utilized for analysis, development and testing of
the platform.
UAL researchers will focus on defining fashion ontology and typology, which will underpin the site functionalities, as well as
act as a benchmark for classification of UK fashion and textile sector for digital purposes.
A comprehensive database of UK fashion researchers and fashion/textile relevant higher education institutions will be
collated in order to populate the platform and provide an accessible knowledge database of potential academic partners for
collaborative research.
The collation and classification of potential sources of fashion research news and information will provide a basis for a
sustainable stream of fashion and textile research, and act as a reference resource for both fashion SMEs and researchers
including development of new editorial content featuring groundbreaking people and research themes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiary of the FIRE.Digital will be the UK fashion and textile sector. The project directly addresses the three
main challenges identified by the British Fashion Council: lack of a formal R&amp;amp;D culture; lack of knowledge and contacts
within the industry; and weak knowledge exchange and open innovation practices.
FIRE.Digital platform will provide a new and dynamic way for the sector to interact with academic research. It will offer both
curated and automatically generated content from selected sources and entirely new content generated by the FIRE
community to fashion businesses. It will enable the sector to find relevant research partners, provide a stream of up to date
information on new developments in fashion research, act as the primary repository for research information for designer
fashion and textile enterprises, and information on available funding for collaborative R&amp;amp;D. In addition, the platform will
provide a resource and repository for previous collaborative research and KE, thus creating benchmarks and exemplars for
the sector to build upon.
Fashion and textile researchers across the UK will have access to a research network and emerging themes within the
fashion and textiles sector through FIRE network and digital platform and an opportunity to access industry partners. They
will have access to substantial qualitative and quantitative data applicable in a range of research activities, from digital
behavior to fashion networks. FIRE.Digital will facilitate new research consortia between fashion researchers, SME
partners and industry organizations that will directly benefit fashion and textile HEIs across the UK.
Learning from the research into and operation of the networks and insights generated from platform data regarding the
designer fashion and textile sector can be disseminated and applied to other creative industries via academic networks,
including the AHRC KE Hubs and their legacy within universities across the UK.
FIRE will implement open research innovation, which will promote knowledge exchange and propose new business models
driven by user led innovation for the UK designer fashion and textile sector. This will enable designer fashion and textile
enterprises to change their business culture and practices by engaging with academic research utilizing KE and Open
Innovation approaches.
The findings resulting from FIRE activities will have impact on UK policy makers in developing and shaping new policies for
a more sustainable UK fashion sector.
Open Innovation and Knowledge exchange promoted by FIRE will enable the sector and academia to share best practices
in tackling environmental impact of fashion sector and adopting more sustainable practices.
FIRE.Digital offers a model that could be replicated for other sections of the creative industries, which are also
characterized by fragmentation and an inhibited R&amp;amp;D culture amongst micro-enterprises and SMEs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80127</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of FIREup project and FIRE platform Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A1F9324-8A10-4406-9605-3DD8D4ED4F74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation of the FIREup project and the new FIRE.Digital platform to an academic audience of about 25 lecturers and researchers at Nottingham Trent University.

This gave insights into the rapidly evolving landscape of fashion professionals' engagement with online resources and tools and enabled the web developers Suburb to gain first hand knowledge of the designer fashion sector, and design the platform with full understanding of user needs at the forefront. This knowledge was captured and fed into other desktop and literature research and development of the underpinning ontologies and typologies providing structure for the site. The project research builds towards a more nuanced understanding of the designer fashion sector, and develops an approach that assists in engageing a hard-to-reach community.
The platform has recently been launched (Feb 2016) and is currently being publicised and populated with users and content generated and edited by the FIRE team and the site users. Curated content provides accessible information about research projects in the fashion sector. The site now hosts over 100 users.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are populating the site in its initial stage, and when a critical mass has evolved data can be gathered and analysed. This is envisaged to provide information on interactions and evolution of networks within the designer fashion ecosystem. There is very little academic research into the operation of the fashion system from a designer/creativity viewpoint and the platform will continue to provide research data and will be developed as a research tool, (further funding permitting) . The research from the FIRE-Digital project will contribute to academic outputs and be of interest to other researchers looking at fashion and to other creative industries that may operate on a different cycle than fashion but wish to interact. Detailed and specific knowledge related to the economically important designer fashion sector can inform both academia and industry, enhancing understanding for other non fashion sectors, and for fashion business and design management and ultimately, policy makers</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4EBB4165-D341-492B-9037-039D9ACC5F6F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dedd8f0777f0.23172793</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.fire-fashion.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Further development of prototype platform designed to provide a portal for academic research in fashion and textiles and to engage academics with SMEs in the designer fashion and textiles sector.
