1. Climate Change Impacts 
Man-made climate change has been estimated to cost the UK economy 5-20% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounting to ?80-320 billion for 2011 GDP. The National Oceanography Centre (NOC) is providing impartial, independent, world-leading expertise in developing the international scientific consensus that informs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) series of Assessment Reports. NOC provides authoritative oceanographic scientific evidence to underpin the assessments, necessary as climate change has enormous economic and societal implications. NOC research is a significant contributor to the international delivery of evidence on ocean circulation, global temperature, sea level and climate.
2. The Marine Renewable Energy Industry
 NOC science has underpinned the assessments of both energy resource availabilities and significance of environmental impacts of marine renewable energy installations, enabling growth of the sector and on-going cost savings for stakeholders. In particular, NOC's strength and reputation in tidal modelling and ocean observations have been of particular interest to an industry that, by definition, plans to extract energy from some of the most extreme marine environments in the world where accurate predictions and measurements of tides and waves are essential.
3. NOC Satellite Oceanography supports growth of the UK Space sector 
NOC Satellite Oceanography (NOC-SO) delivers research, consultancy and training in ocean remote sensing techniques relevant to monitoring the ocean, shelf seas and coastal regions globally. NOC has developed close relationships with key stakeholders in the UK space sector such as Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) and Astrium, leading to significant opportunities for economic growth. Its unique position and long-term outlook allows NOC to define and develop new satellite missions, sensors and Earth Observation products that address the needs of operational users, enhance the international competitive advantage of the UK space industry and are of benefit to science.
4. NOC Public Outreach and Media Engagement 
NOC has an active programme of public outreach and media engagement through websites, media releases, requested commentary on new items, twitter, contributions to television productions, and school resources that supports NOC and wider marine community in engaging with the public to highlight the importance of marine science to the global environment. This activity is aligned with UK's Concordat principle for Engaging the Public with Research to &amp;quot;enhance research so that it contributes positively to society and results in greater relevance, accountability and transparency.&amp;quot; NOC is the preferred commentator within the UK for marine news in both broadcast and print media.
5. Sustainability and health of UK national seas: now and the future 
NOC was pivotal in providing advice and evidence feeding into UK assessments on &amp;quot;clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas&amp;quot;. These underpin legislation aimed at achieving this vision, specifically the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In the UK this took the form of the report: &amp;quot;Charting Progress 2: The State of UK Seas&amp;quot;, and the on-going Evidence Groups. Alongside this, the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) and UKCP09 (UK Climate Projections) provide assessments of potential future conditions. NOC is the leading UK organisation for providing this evidence, advice, information and future projections for physical oceanography. Its scientists were lead / co-authors for CP2 &amp;quot;Ocean Processes&amp;quot; chapter, most MCCIP science reviews, and the UKCP09 Marine Section. 
6. Training the next generation of the UK's skilled workforce in ocean science and technology 
The UK Government has a core policy of developing a skilled workforce to improve public policy, and underpin an innovating and expanding UK economy (especially in emerging low carbon and innovation technologies). NOC is a key partner in training postgraduates in STEM subjects within the Graduate School of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (GSNOCS), and Universities of Liverpool and Bangor. Within the 2007-2012 period NOC has contributed to the training of &amp;gt;150 PhD graduates that are contributing to UK economic / societal benefit. 
7. Cost avoidance: underpinning science base for coastal flood hazards 
NOC science in the areas of sea level study, modelling of storm surges, waves and tsunamis, and the statistics of sea level extremes, underpins many aspects of government policy on coastal defence and the mitigation of risk. The science forms the basis of mature operational partnerships with the Environment Agency and with the Met Office. Through the Natural Hazards Partnership, NOC reviews coastal hazards for the National Risk Assessment (NRA) and advises the Government Chief Scientist on this issue. 
8. Seafloor mapping and monitoring: Marine Protected Areas and policy advice 
As human activities in the marine environment proliferate, there is an increasing need for high-quality seafloor mapping and monitoring data (the 'evidence base') to support integrated marine planning, sustainable resource exploitation, and maintenance of ecosystem services. NOC scientists are meeting this requirement by i) developing new technologies, techniques and products (maps) to improve the quality, coverage and cost-effectiveness of data, ii) providing expert scientific advice to UK and international policy-makers, e.g. Defra, to underpin marine conservation and governance, and iii) leading efforts, through MAREMAP, to improve co-ordination of marine mapping and monitoring activities across NERC and the public sector.
9. Informing UK Naval procurement and operations 
NOC is a strategic partner with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in supporting technology, innovation, and scientific advice, particularly in areas of &amp;quot;marine environmental battlespace&amp;quot; and unmanned maritime systems. The UK Ministry of Defence Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDR) sets clear targets for national security and defence capabilities, and a clear objective of this strategy is greater focussed science and technology capability provided by strategic partners. NOC is a strategic partner in providing specialised capability in technological innovation and application of autonomous surveillance systems, ocean environment and counter-detection of submarines, and operational oceanographic modelling to the MoD and associated defence industry.
10. Deep water frontier hydrocarbon exploration 
Until new energy sources can be developed, the world economy and human wellbeing remains dependent on hydrocarbons, many of which are in subsea reservoirs found in increasingly deep waters or extreme conditions (e.g. West of Shetland &amp;amp; Arctic Oceans). NOC has made a significant contribution to economic growth through its delivery of scientific results in the areas of crustal geophysics, rock physics and seafloor environmental observatories for deep-water frontier oil and gas exploration. Example studies include: geological crustal scale analysis of seismic refraction data in the Arctic Ocean; environmental observatories in deep water frontier and mature exploration areas; and fundamental rock physics studies for improved geophysical imaging and quantification for reservoir exploration, characterisation and monitoring.
11.United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the formulae allowing coastal states to claim continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and allows states to exploit the natural resources of the seabed and subsoil of this continental shelf. UNCLOS also contains provisions for the protection and preservation of the marine environment. NOC has led the technical advice to the UK Government on all four UK claims under Article 76, provided advice and services to several overseas governments, and continues to provide advice on several aspects of UNCLOS, including delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles
12. NOC science and technology maintaining a competitive advantage for UK marine science industry
The UK marine science and technology sector in 2012 had estimated turnover of ?1.35billion (double the 2010 figure) with exports of ?500 million. NOC is a world leader in developing new technologies for marine science that are being translated into new products for UK companies. These instruments, conceived by NOC scientists include a range of new platforms, analytical tools and sensors, are internationally recognised as world-leading technology, and in collaboration with industry, are becoming commercial instruments. This world leading technology developed by NOC is assisting the UK marine science industry to maintain a competitive advantage and continue its remarkable expansion.
Beneficiaries of NOC-developed technology include UK offshore technology and engineering industry; UK environmental monitoring industry; UK-listed mining and petroleum industries and public sector agencies tasked with mitigating effects of environmental change, UK defence industry, and we have high support and application from industry.
13. Ocean business exhibitions supporting UK marine scientific industries
Working with a start-up company Intelligent Exhibitions, Ocean Business was established in 2007 to meet industry demand for a new event involving hands-on trials of instruments and training sessions. Following the first event (146 exhibitors and 1534 visitors from 48 countries) Ocean Business has successively grown in exhibitor and visitor numbers, with the 2013 event sold out to &amp;gt;300 exhibitors and 4000+ visitors. Following their successful start-up, Intelligent Exhibitions has gone on to diversify into additional markets, including the LIDAR Mapping Forum, Marine Electronmagnetics Conference Marelec and the weekly Oceanbuzz publication, an ocean technology newsletter with over 13,000 subscribers.
14. Tidal and wave data applications to support coastal and offshore users
Physical properties of the oceans, such as tides are key parameters for working in offshore and coastal locations. Understanding how these change and interact is vital information for many disciplines. We use a combination of data processing to convert raw scientific data into more useable forms, then develop commercially available software tools to manipulate and visualise the information into formats that make it more accessible to non-specialists. The National Oceanography Centre (NOC) 'Applications Team' develops these unique added-value products to be harnessed by users generating economic growth impact (sales of tide tables, maximising port vessel operations) and societal benefits (safety at sea, flood defences).
