Mick has invested considerable effort into developing the business model and has invested nearly &amp;pound;400k of his personal money into the projects to date.
It is well known that wet wipes dispense inefficiently from their containers. Up to 30% of wipes are wasted due to a combination of multiple wipes ?streaming? out of the packs and wipes prematurely drying out. These problems remain unresolved leaving a huge opportunity for the provider of the correct solution. Solutions have been developed and patented by Sound Approach Ltd which solve these problems.
Developing more efficient dispense systems for pouch packs of wipes will provide the chosen licensees with a major competitive advantage. By offering the consumer a product that will obviate the present frustrations and costs associated to using wet wipes, they will be able to increase their share of the massive, growing $ 4.5 billion annual market for pouch packs of wet wipes, 80% of which are baby wipes.
Sound Approach Ltd was awarded a proof of concept grant in 2011 which enabled sample pouch packs of baby wipes and other wipe types to be produced featuring perforation designs and flexible nozzles built into ?rigid flip tops? (RFT?s) that attach to the tops of pouch packs through which the wipes dispense. Together these unique attributes are called ?EaziKlenz? and are fully patented by the company.
Having documented their interest in seeing working samples that prove the concept, Kimberly Clark, a company which sells $1.5 billion worth of baby wipes alone per annum, now requires a batch of prototype samples for an in depth market study so as to establish the market appeal of EaziKlenz and its price performance in the very cost sensitive baby wipes market.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58929</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720221</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
