Through this partnership we have been talking with two other organisations : Steep Hill Laboratories in California US, and the Jocknick Foundation in Sweden, about establishing a centre of excellence of cannabis research at University of Exeter.

Light sheet microscopy (LSM) is an emerging imaging technique that provides non-destructive 3D imaging of biomedical samples using a sheet of light that illuminates a single plane of the sample at a time. The method is ideally suited for applications that require rapid imaging of intact biomedical samples such as tissue biopsies and small organisms and has great potential to transform biomedical microscopy. Because tissues are exposed to only a thin plane of light, photobleaching and phototoxicity are significantly lower when compared to conventional wide-field fluorescence and confocal microscopy. LSM produces well-registered serial sections that are suitable for three-dimensional reconstruction of tissue structures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In collaboration with M Squared Lasers, the PI - J Moger - will construct a prototype light sheet microscope at the University of Exeter's new Living System institute (LSI). Once in place, the collaboration will perform proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of light sheet microscopy to leading biomedical researchers, and make modifications according to biomedical requirements.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Activinsights</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Activinsights Ltd - V Stiles</gtr:description><gtr:id>3AD9415D-71E1-4733-9016-FF83DC8EF84C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first publication (pending - due to be written in 2017) will provide information on the feasibility aspects of the project and outline the development of methods used to quantify mechanical training load in runners.
As a result of working on this project, Dr V Stiles has developed expertise with management of large datasets and alternative methods to analyse this type of longitudinal data in STATA (data management and stats package). This is necessary for the handling of larger datasets from future follow-up studies.
As a result of our collaboration, Activinsights has been able to help us gain access to contacts at the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to discuss the possibility of assessing workload relevant to injury in tennis players.
We plan to continue working alongside Activinsights Ltd to enable any algorithms we develop to quantify training load as result of this work and future follow-up work to be incorporated into activity monitors that contain on-board processing capabilities. There is a clear pathway for outcomes from this project to be utilised by the company which will enable runners to personally monitor workload relevant to injury and modify their training programmes accordingly. Developing wearable devices to monitor training load will have a positive bearing on understanding and preventing injury.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02ac3d9c5e7.62437058-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Activinsights have provided us with hardware (activity monitors on loan) and staff time, providing the benefit of their expertise in how they have piloted work in this area in other sports and their support in thinking about the best way to enable findings and algorithms from this work to be incorporated into future monitors with on-board processing capability. 

Discussions with Activinsights Ltd over the course of the project has confirmed that the work undertaken in this area is of interest, both to them but also in the wider sports community. Wearable devices are being used by a lot of sports teams but they are not currently able to extract meaningful measures of workload from their data. As a result of our collaboration, Activinsights has also been able to help us gain access to contacts at the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to discuss the possibility of assessing workload relevant to injury in tennis players.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Physical activity and injury questionnaire data has been collected on 40 runners every other week for a period of 12 weeks (between January and April 2016). This intensive monitoring has not been done before but we have been able to recruit sufficient participants who have fulfilled the requirements of the project. We are currently in the process of finalising this analysis in preparation for our first publication from the project. The first publication will inform the feasibility aspects of the project and outline the development of methods used to quantify mechanical training load in runners.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GW Pharmaceuticals</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>GW - C Morgan</gtr:description><gtr:id>552C6CA5-A55B-4B31-A183-5D7E2E8E897E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership faced delay due to changes in the project scope and a lack of agreement between the two parties, GW and UoE.

Notably the imaging work was used as pilot work in two successful equipment grant applications to Alzheimer's Research UK (&amp;pound;43k) and Wellcome Trust Multiuser equipment grant (&amp;pound;600k) awarded to Randall (lead PI) and others (including Tyler) in 2016. These now provide additional specialty capabilities that will enhance the neuroscience field at UoE, widening the scope of research, and resources that will draw in future partnerships. Further bids to the MRC are also being considered.
The research team have developed multiple new skills in zebrafish brain imaging, in vivo zebrafish electrophysiology, and novel neurophysiological models of epilepsy. The work also helped in an ongoing move to develop silicone probe-based recording methods in their laboratory. As a result they have submitted one manuscript on the fish brain imaging (revisions of which were completed in November 2016) and are soon to submit another on the brain slice recording.
UoE has since hosted a visit from senior AstraZeneca scientists to discuss further collaborations. In addition, in a January 2016 they acted as a co-applicant on a BBSRC grant submission that developed from this project.
The real-time images of brain activity in zebrafish have been used in undergraduate teaching and will be further disseminated in a new public engagement activity in 2017. Finally, increased employment of zebrafish imaging for frontline neurotoxic studies in the future may also represent a 3Rs-related impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c164ffdc7d91.00588034-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>AstraZeneca neuroscience iMEd were interested in the use of zebrafish to study neuronal activity in intact CNS circuits, in particular for the progression of drugs that interact with signalling at GABAergic synapses.

The model system employed was the zebrafish brain. The project was driven by taking on a one year full time undergraduate placement (professional training year) to bring together the expertise of Prof Randall in the study of neural circuits and Prof Charles Tyler (Co-I) in the study of zebrafish to generate an experimental platform in which AstraZeneca have expressed an interest in developing.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hospira</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hospira - T Ahmad</gtr:description><gtr:id>82994E86-089F-4299-BA20-079FF04D9AC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Definitions of treatment response, remission and loss of response have been developed and validated. Recruitment of the desired 1500 patients taking anti-TNF drugs is nearly complete, with 230 patients successfully enrolled who had either switched to or started on Inflectra. This is more biosimilar-treated patients than originally expected; Hospira has agreed to contribute an additional &amp;pound;83,618 as follow-on funding (total partner contribution, &amp;pound;231,000). A genome wide association study (GWAS) of response and antibody formation has been conducted using a discovery cohort of 600 patients. A replication cohort will comprise the other 900 patients

Industry partnership: As a consequence of this study a new partnership has also been stuck with NAPP Pharmaceuticals who market the same biosimilar. They were attracted by the study and supported the University with a &amp;pound;50k educational grant. The project group has also gained further funding from AbbVie (US)$1.8M to conduct transcriptomics, HLA typing and epigenetics, and they will also part fund a post-doc with a contribution of &amp;pound;90k over 3 years to assist with the analysis (total cost &amp;pound;141,637, with the balance funded by the University). Further, negotiations are underway with a biotech company, Genentech, who would like to share genomic data around response to anti-TNF drugs. 
NHS benefit: Involvement by NHS clinicians and IBD patients in research has increased. Greater participation in our studies has helped to formalise treatment algorithms, patient follow-up and drug monitoring (captured on our web based tool). NHS and UoE have together established the first UK biologic drug &amp;amp; antibody level service and now provide this UK-wide, facilitating smarter, cost-effective use of expensive drugs by the NHS. Full economic cost saving to the NHS is underway.
Policy: We will submit our first publication in the second quarter of 2017 with the intent that this will be used to inform the NICE diagnostic workgroup who are developing guidelines around Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of Anti TNF in Crohn's disease. The data from this study will be used to support a Diagnostic Report commissioned by the NIHR HTA programme on behalf of NICE.

Next: We will further investigate Immunogenicity to anti-TNF therapy, the development of which is a major challenge to current therapy. The temporal evolution of antibodies to IFX and ADA, and the clinical impact of ADA formation on disease activity and health care costs, will also be investigated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0234bdc70f5.73244497-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Hospira provided a contribution of &amp;pound;147,382, later increased to &amp;pound;231,000 based on recruitment and project milestones. Additional funding based on future publication milestones is pending.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) are monoclonal antibody biologic drugs that work against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), used to treat advanced Crohn's disease. Typically 10-40% of patients fail to respond to 12 weeks of therapy (primary non-response, PNR), and a further 23-46% of patients mount an immune response to the drug leading to loss of response (LOR). In February 2015 RemsimaTM and InflectraTM, cheaper biosimilars of Infliximab (the latter made by Hospira), became available in the UK. Using the genomic expertise and patient cohorts available at Exeter, these drugs were investigated to understand how UK patients were responding to the drugs and aiming to personalise anti-TNF therapy for Crohn's Disease patients.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>AstraZeneca - Student Masterclass</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FAA955B-162B-4D86-9835-388BA44BC0D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Designed as part of wider strategy to strengthen our existing relationship, a 'student masterclass' was initiated with AstraZeneca to give students first-hand experience of day-to-day life in a big corporation. Five students from our clinical sciences course visited the company's different departments over a consecutive 7 day period, providing them insight into various business and research activities. This allowed UoE to expand the partnership beyond pure research-led collaborations, in a move to incorporate more human resource and training activities, including talent recruitment and student supervision. This masterclass was extremely well received on both sides and consequently has been renewed for a second year. This is planned to take place in Spring 2017 with more students (up to 10) attending. Once again AstraZeneca will contribute towards the travel and accommodation costs as well as provide a considerable in-kind contribution in staff time given that they plan the agenda, involve several departments and manage the whole week at their facility. AstraZeneca hope that the experience will help them attract talent from UoE in the near future and will also help the industry as a whole to highlight skills gaps to the university to ensure such recruits meet those needs.

Having a single point of contact embedded within the partner's organisation has enabled interaction to develop quickly and lead to considerable early outcomes. Renishaw is interested in formalising the relationship between the parties, to include a provision of rolling funding for research projects, equipment and provision of courses to Renishaw. The new Living Systems Institute was highlighted by Renishaw Diagnostics as an area of potential interest, although specific academics and theme areas for collaboration will be reviewed on an ongoing basis following the launch of the Institute is in November 2016.
Potential also exists for undertaking CPD for Renishaw staff; particularly for Renishaw staff to undergo a Laser safety course. A course tailored to Renishaw's needs is being progressed.
Degree Apprenticeships: As a direct result of the exchange, Renishaw are now one of our industry employers for the Digital and Technology Solutions degree apprenticeship, which launched in September 2016. They have 3 apprentices, which equates to income of &amp;pound;81k in fees: &amp;pound;27k per apprentice, with 1/3rd contributed by Renishaw and 2/3rd drawn down as match from the Skills Funding Agency (SFA). Renishaw are keen to build on this partnership and recruit further cohorts of apprentices in subsequent years; anticipated numbers are likely to increase to at least 6 apprentices per year in future (equivalent to &amp;pound;160k per cohort). 
Magnet Sensors: This is an area of general interest for Renishaw and it is hoped to grow into further collaboration. We have established a small contract research agreement (&amp;pound;3,000+VAT) to study the relationship between the remanence and the holding current on Renishaw's Brake Coil Housing. 
Study of vibration modes of Hexapod: This is a current problem that Renishaw has within the development of one of its platforms. The idea is for Renishaw to gain a better understanding of the vibration modes that affect the Hexapod. A series of meetings has resulted in the establishment of a small contract research agreement (&amp;pound;4,655+VAT) to study the vibration mode analysis using a simplified model as a starting point and assessing the opportunities to create automatic mode analysis. 
Exploitation of new materials: Renishaw wrote a letter of support for Geoff Nash's EPSRC fellowship. The fellowship seeks to create techniques and technology that will allow the optical characterisation of biological samples, with sub-wavelength spatial resolution, across the infrared to THz regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Renishaw's in-kind contribution is around &amp;pound;30,500.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0371c6e4748.79410110-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Part-funded staff costs and provided facilities and resources.

A grant application building on the collaborative work is currently under review. P2D investment has successfully developed a strengthened relationship between the research team and Eli Lilly. This collaboration has formed the basis for a successful joint application to the Alzheimer's Society for &amp;pound;395k, with Eli Lilly providing a commitment to match-fund the bid with a &amp;pound;300k in-kind contribution.

All planned data collection has been completed; analysis is extensive and ongoing. Indeed focus was on gathering due to time the award funded and need to access equipment within this time. Data analysis is ongoing but aspects of the work have already been presented at national and international conferences including a major Alzheimer's disease conference and the world's largest Neuroscience meeting.
We will write a paper together on the work and will expand the research into new directions working in partnership.
In 4Q 2015 we made two applications, one to Alzheimer's Research UK, and Wellcome Trust to enable us to get the hardware to establish these methods in Exeter. We used data from Dr Tamagnini's work at Lilly as supporting data. Both were awarded: &amp;pound;43,000 from Alzheimer's Research UK and &amp;pound;584,000 from Wellcome Trust. 
Exeter became a partner (along with Kings) on Lilly's successful BBSRC CTP bid, our relationship was cited as part of this award which will fund 12 collaborative PhD students</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e151883033e3.09439245-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Eli Lilly will provide all of the experimental animals used for Dr Tamagnini's experiments. These are predominantly &amp;quot;J20&amp;quot; mice. These animals are genetically modified to model a key aspect of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The pathology is progressive and age-dependent so the mice need to be aged prior to study. To support our Lilly collaborations around electrophysiology we have very recently started to breed a colony of identical mice in Exeter with MRC funds (and founders donated by Lilly)- having these mice in Devon will facilitate transferring learning back to Exeter. 

In addition Lilly will provide access to their state of the art in vivo 2 photon imaging microscope. An imaging facility of this nature is not available in Exeter- although obtaining funding for one is a key objective. A recently installed multiuser microscope of this nature in the Bristol University imaging facility charges ~&amp;pound;50 an hour to users. Eli Lilly provided around 300 hours of imaging time in for our research visit to Lilly (an in-kind value of &amp;pound;15000). Lilly also contributed through staff time and accomodation costs of the researcher.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funds from the PtoD fund supported a post doc salary for 6 months working at Lilly's neuroscience research group in Surrey. He received training in the various surgical, experimental and analytical techniques used to perform in vivo multiphoton imaging of the rodent CNS parenchyma. These skills will then be transferred back to Exeter where we are aiming to establish similar methods for multiple investigations in the Biomedical Neuroscience group, the University of Exeter Alzheimer's Society Doctoral training centre and ultimately The Living Systems institute.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4665</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

The Committee heard from a clinical expert that this is a fast-moving area and a lot of research is being done. It also noted that the UK-based PANTS - Personalised Anti-TNF Therapy in Crohn's Disease - study should provide relevant data; but results are not expected until the end of 2016. The Committee concluded that data from this ongoing research are likely to be important when the guidance is considered for updating in the future.
