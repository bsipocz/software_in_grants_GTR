For example, the 2010 Turner Prize was awarded to Susan Phillipsz for 'Lowlands Away', a work in which recordings of a traditional Scottish lament were played beneath bridges along the River Clyde. With the increasing availability of portable digital devices and online platforms, it is now common to find artists producing site-specific audio installations, sonic performances, audio walks and online audio maps.

This fellowship will explore the potential of such 'audio methods' for researching sonic environments. It is based on the conviction that audio methods may offer significant advantages over traditional text-based research methods. The oft-quoted saying &amp;quot;writing about music is like dancing about architecture&amp;quot; could apply equally to sound. Audio methods allow for a much richer, more dynamic engagement with sound than text-based studies. In a world where online multimedia continue to multiply, audio methods may also help to make research more accessible to a wider range of audiences.

However, the use of audio methods for research raises a number of questions and issues. How can techniques developed for artistic purposes function as modes of research enquiry? What kinds of knowledge are produced by digital audio, and how does this compare with knowledge produced using other kinds of media such as images and text? What are the legal and ethical implications of the digitalization of audio? With technologies such as podcasting, surround sound and mapping audio using GPS, what technical and practical challenges arise and how can these be overcome? And how can audio fit with, and complement, other sensory methods and media?

These questions will be explored using participant observation with experts working on the boundary between sound art and research. Over ten sessions (eight UK, two overseas), I will take part in, observe and document a variety of approaches to the use of audio methods. The sessions will be designed to fit around the experts' ongoing projects and the challenges that they are facing in using audio methods. Digital audio will be used to record and analyse the sessions, supplemented by photos and field notes. The aim is to produce a rich, detailed, multimedia portrait of audio methods 'in action'.

The results of the research will be shared through the production of three journal papers, a series of 'work in progress' podcasts, a case study for a website that supports researchers to use digital media (www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk) and a radio programme. I will also give conference and seminar presentations. This mixture of outputs will target two main audiences:

i. People for whom the use of audio to explore sonic environments is a core interest and developed skill, particularly sound art researchers. The research will help them to critically reflect on, refine and further develop their working practices.

ii. A wider group of researchers with an interest in using audio media, but limited specialist knowledge and skills. This will include musicologists, human geographers, anthropologists, historians, architects, sociologists, and those working with video and other sensory methods. The research will provide them with theoretical, ethical, practical and technical guidance that will enable them to begin experimenting with audio methods in their own work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this research will be academics, as outlined in the Case for Support.

The research also has potential impacts beyond academia:

- Cultural benefits to the public, through accessible creative dissemination, including work in progress podcasts and a radio programme that will be created from audio recorded during the project. This will raise awareness of the sonic arts and their potential for fostering engagement with environments. Timescale: during the fellowship and immediately thereafter.

- Benefits to artists, specifically sound artists and musicians, through critical reflection on their practices prompted by the research. Timescale: during the fellowship and for two years thereafter.

- Benefits to cultural organisations dealing with sound and the environment, such as sound art galleries (SoundFjord, London; Diapason, New York) and libraries (e.g. the British Library sound archive). They would benefit through increased knowledge and understanding of the relationship between sonic arts and research knowledge, and through critical reflection on the uses of audio media for exploring sonic environemnts. Timescale: during the fellowship and for two years thereafter.

- Wider indirect benefits to the public, through increased use of audio media by academics, to which the fellowship will make a significant contribution. This will ultimately make arts, humanities and social science research more publicly accessible, thereby raising public awareness of research e.g. through installations, sound walks, radio shows or performances. Such impacts will, however, be difficult (if not impossible) to track and attribute to the fellowship. Timescale: five to ten years following the end of the fellowship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Short soundscape composition based on field recordings made as part of the research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FAE06AD9-3CA2-4306-B1E4-B9651A9069A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Composition was used as part of audio material presented at the Urban Soundscapes and Critical Citizenship conference, University of Limerick, Ireland, March 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460cb34087fa1.64256341</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Rummelsburg soundscape, Berlin</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the Arts London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Creative Research into Sound Arts Practice (CRiSAP)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with CRiSAP, UAL</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC2C0F1C-E1D5-48E3-9DCA-9A1CE4A40128</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Listening in and out of more-than-human worlds. &amp;pound;14,375 Leverhulme Artist in Residence grant with sound artist Dr. Mark Peter Wright.

The idea was developed by James Wyness, a sound artist based in the Scottish Borders. James suggested holding a sound gathering to explore its use as a method for working with environmental audio. It also enabled me to examine how environmental sound art can work in a rural context, outside the predominantly urban circuit of galleries and established venues. The event engaged a variety of people, both artists and the general public.

The sound gathering took place over a weekend in June 2013. Funds from my fellowship were used to cover costs for hire of a village hall and some refreshments.

The event included:

- Workshops exploring listening, field recording, and working with the sounds of wool carding and dyeing, led by sound artists Patrick McGinley (Estonia) and Felicity Ford (UK)

- An evening spent sharing field recordings, including contributions from me, James, Felicity, Patrick, and several other artists based in the borders and further afield, such as wildlife recordist Geoff Sample.

- An improvised, site-specific sound performance using found objects in a disused quarry.

In total around 20 people attended over the course of the weekend.


Participants reported positive experiences, learned skills that they will incorporate in their own work and met like-minded people living in their local area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2150949632.8895440cbbb1b6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thedomesticsoundscape.com/wordpress/?p=5195</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geographies of sound, radio and participation, RGS-IBG 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA31CD92-2DDD-46C2-A109-7CF7383EFC11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was an invited discussant in a session on 'Geographies of sound, radio and participation' at the Royal Geographical Society with Institute of British Geographers annual conference, London, August 2014.

There have also been wider public benefits amongst people who are interested in learning the basics about sound recording. My website contains guidance on these matters, produced during the fellowship and using data collected during it. A number of people have posted comments noting how helpful this has been. e.g. see

Soundscape recordings do not just reproduce sounds. There are different ways of understanding how they function. For example, we can hear them as representations, like the sonic equivalent of a photograph, providing a sound portrait of a particular time and place. But equally we can hear them as something happening in the here-and-now. Playback is a performance by machines that always takes place in a sonic environment of some kind. So for example we might be listening to a recording of a dawn chorus, but doing so inside a museum. The result merges acoustic elements of these two environments to create a hybrid sense of space.

2. This hybrid mixing can be played with to produce interesting effects. For example, if we listen to recordings of city sounds on headphones whilst walking through a city, we may start to question which sounds are really happening 'live' and which sounds are recorded. This can have powerful effects, such as unsettling people's sense of place, encouraging them to listen differently to familiar places, or enabling them to realise that media are not just truthful representations, but work by creating illusions.

3. Audio recordings, like all kinds of sound, can affect both people and things, sometimes powerfully. Sound can cause people and animals to jump, startle, move more quickly or more slowly and so on. I extreme cases it can move materials, e.g. aircraft sonic booms shattering glass. These effects can happen very quickly, without us even being aware of them. They don't require a listener who consciously hears sound and then responds. When working with sound, it is worth being aware of how it can affect bodies.

4. There are ethical dimensions to audio recording. Sound and audio are not simply benign. For example, soundscape recordings can be disorientating, in some cases causing distress. These effects can be interesting to play with in artistic works, but care is needed. The technologies used also tend to be produced through systems of gross inequality, e.g. poor labour conditions in far eastern technology manufacturing and mineral mining. There is no easy solution to such issues, but they are worth bearing in mind. The tendency to uncritically celebrate the spread of cheap electronic devices needs to be questioned.

5. Recording sounds is a fairly simple technical skill. With some basic equipment, and the time to practice, it can be learned by most people. However, it is much more difficult to use audio recordings in a way that generates deep engagement with, and novel insights into, a topic or theme. Sound art is dedicated to this aim, so anyone who wants to use sound to research something would do well to familiarise themselves with its history, techniques, and the current state of the art. That is not a trivial task. It may be necessary for researchers to work in collaboration with sound artists to achieve this.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Anyone interested in environmental sound could use my findings to help them better understand what that entails, practically, conceptually and ethically. That might include:

- sound artists who want to develop their practice to be more reflexive and critical
- designers who want to consider how sounds can affect people in different ways
- researchers who want to understand how sound recording can produce knowledge, and the ethics and politics of that process
- people in the cultural sector e.g. museums, galleries, who want to think about creative uses for sound
