From a social science perspective this explosion in rich online communication exchanges opens up possibilities for better understanding these new forms of social expression through organic data rather than through more traditional forms of social science data. The scale of social media use also makes it important for social science research concerned with Big Data. Through innovative, cross-disciplinary work, including with industry, using state of the art technical infrastructures, we will develop a framework for analyzing the value of social media images to better understand these new social worlds. Specifically we are interested in how these new forms of social expression can be understood through studying their technical infrastructures. Including a focus on users, we investigate how a bottom-up understanding of social media users can better inform how these structures are experienced. We are concerned with devising comprehensive methodological and theoretical strategies for the capture and interpretation of social media image data. This will be done at different scales, using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We are interested in finding ways to enable the study of images to become a more central focus within social media and Big Data research and will investigate how such a shift in focus may have an impact on key stakeholders and end-users.
People currently produce and use a lot of images as part of their everyday lives, primarily using digital media and online social media platforms. Amongst UK Internet users, posting photos has significantly increased in recent years. The taking and sending of photos are now the two most prevalent activities after text messaging. People send, collect, organize, and show images of things they value, including already existing images that they value, often because they are valued in a wider collective cultural context. Such images can be meaningful as documents, forms of play, acts of witnessing, as aesthetic artefacts, historical records, and/or as tokens of collective identity. By focusing on the structures, users, and the content of social media images, the project will produce cross-disciplinary theoretical and methodological innovations for understanding how images function as pictures of the social world and within the networked relationships of social media. These conceptual devices and methods will address the quantitative magnitude and the qualitative intensity of social media image production and circulation. They will include the development of online tools to capture and study both small-scale and large-scale image datasets. 
We suggest that for social media and Big Data research to comprehensively and rigorously address the huge shift in communication technologies, it needs to be able to speak to and account for the complexities and fluid nature of the current information ecosystem. In order to understand these new forms of social expression, focusing here on the production, use and circulation of images these elements have to be studied and understood together. The technical and software infrastructure that shapes how users are able to communicate through social media and how this enables other users to make sense of this content needs to be included in this. In the emerging fields of social media and Big Data research emphasis is placed on the volume, veracity and variety of data, rather than its meaning or depth. Consequently, critiques of Big Data have highlighted that a more nuanced approach is required. Approaches sensitive to multiple data characteristics including an attention to 'deep data', will allow for a fuller understanding of society in a complex world. We argue this can be achieved in a particularly rich way by looking at social media images.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We see the beneficiaries of this research as being the government, policy-makers and think tanks, the private sector and the academic community. We see strong potential for Economic and Societal impact, specifically for the planned research to make a contribution to evidence-based policy making and influencing policy (at local, national and international level), to enhance research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses and organizations, and contribute to the training of skilled people in non-academic professions. Ensuring potential beneficiaries have the opportunity to engage with our research, we plan to organize a number of different dissemination activities to develop a strong stakeholder engagement prior to impact:

1. Events: we plan to organize three project workshops for our identified stakeholder communities: those from the government and the policy-making community, the private sector and academic stakeholders;
2. Press activity: we aim to actively engage with the press and broadcast media through the writing of targeted media briefings and press releases as well as invited media appearances where appropriate;
3. Communications activity: we will translate our research in an accessible and tailored format for our identified specific user groups. 
Most of these activities will be through the Visual Social Media Lab.

In our Pathways to Impact document we outline our impact objectives per group, as well as our existing strong track records in relation these different stakeholder groups, and finally, we give a number of examples of what measurable impact indicators might look like.
In organizing the three project dissemination events (in London, Sheffield and Manchester), aimed at maximum engagement and therefore capping numbers at around 30 participants for each event, we will draw on our networks and lists of participants from previous impact events. We will also actively engage with the media in sharing our work and news of our events. The PI has recently been invited to Radio 4's flagship programme 'Start the Week' to contribute on the subject of social media. Through potential future invitations of this kind, further public engagement will be enabled. Moreover, all project team members are experienced public speakers and have made national and international media appearances. 

The Visual Social Media Lab will be the public face of the project, and will facilitate knowledge exchange by enabling a strong identity and online presence for our research. We will produce six easy-to-read rapid response reports that all project team members will contribute to. We will seek advice from our Advisory Board, from stakeholders through our events, and the wider academic community. Our social media engagement will be through dedicated social media accounts managed by specific team members.

We will develop and agree on an impact strategy in the first three months of the project and seek advice from our Advisory Board to confirm the effectiveness of our planned strategy and help shape future activities. We will organize events through online booking systems (e.g. Eventbrite) and collect data on participants prior to the event and well as through an exit survey to determine if the needs of our identified user communities have been met and if our research has been communicated clearly and productively. We will also monitor and collect metrics for our website as well as our social media engagement. 

Impact indicators could include:
- Evidence that stakeholders are actively engaging with and using our research, for example by directly citing it or by inviting project team members to present/brief on the research;
- To see a take-up of our developed research methodology by the identified stakeholders;
- To see a take-up of the project research tool for collecting and processing social media image data;
- In general, to see a wider engagement with social media images, which can be traced to our research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206879</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WEF Civic Participation video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB5E8957-555A-440A-B5A4-4E6A731DD69A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Civic Participation' is an episode of a seven-part video series for the World Economic Forum's 'Shaping the Future Implications of Digital Media for Society' project.

The report brings together 15 contributions, featuring contributions from the project team, Google News Lab, Tow Center for Digital Journalism, Columbia University, and WITNESS. The 74-page report has contributed to shaping the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 2016 Annual Meeting at Davos. This remains the foremost creative force for engaging the world's top leaders in collaborative activities focused on shaping the global, regional and industry agendas. It shaped the global agenda in two key ways: 

(1) PI's involvement in WEF's September 2015 Industry Strategy Meeting, which brings together 300 Strategy Officers from leading companies, in order to shape the industry agenda for the Forum's Annual Meeting. Recommendations included in the final report confirm that understanding the Alan Kurdi image is a challenge that 'requires an interdisciplinary approach to develop analytics that help understand what the social explosion of [such] visual content actually means and how a single image drives action.' 

(2) PI's inclusion in a WEF produced film on civic participation, which is part of the 'Shaping the Future Implications of Digital Media for Society' report, launched at Davos. In this film the image is highlighted as a key moment in the refugee crisis in terms of shaping policy and understanding civic participation. 

This research has also been taken up by industry, through the research of Susan Etlinger a leading industry analyst at Altimeter Group (a Prophet company, based in San Francisco). This company advises global organizations on brand strategy, innovation, data strategy and a host of other topics. Our report was included in Altimeter's Digital Trends Report for 2016, as well as the 2016 report 'Image Intelligence: Making Visual Content Predictive', referring to work from the project and quoting the PI. Both Altimeter publications were sent to 50,000 global companies, highlighting the need for a new discipline for understanding the visual web, including innovative analytical approaches to better understanding the role of social media images. The Visual Social Media Lab is identified as a place where such new approaches are being developed. 

The rapid response report was launched in mid-December 2015 and generated significant international media coverage (over 40 articles), triggering further international debate on how the research had shown how the discourse around the refugee crisis had changed. Results from the project were also included in a documentary about these images for Dutch broadcaster VPRO and involved an interview with the PI. This programme was broadcast in March 2016. The report has also been discussed extensively in data journalism circles (such as a panel at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia in April 2016, which included Claire Wardle (Tow Center for Digital Journalism), Craig Silverman (Buzzfeed), Carlotta Sami (UNHCR) as well as members from the project team).

The original proposal had identified 'rapid response' as a key mechanism through which this research could impact discourses around important events.
Through a highly innovative approach, this research contributed to shaping the global agenda and transforming public understanding of the refugee crisis through social media images, as these events were still unfolding. Thus fully exploiting the potential for international impact connected to one of the most urgent contemporary global crises. A year later work from this project was updated in a collaboration with Oxfam to explore how this image had shaped conversation on Twitter about the refugee crisis one year on. 

Finally, the six-month secondment (November 2016 - April 2017) for the RA at the Food Standards Agency (FSA) after the project finished highlights another strand of impact. By hiring Anne Burns to work with social researchers within the FSA and continuing to work closely with the PI, who co-manages this six-month research opportunity, the methods that have been developed as part of the Picturing the Social project have an real chance of being embedded and adopted long-term by a government body. This work in particular could in the long-term contribute to increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy developed within this government agency.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F49E597F-1665-428D-8F63-8C243FF38703</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e18024d159b0.08923399</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project has established an important new space for doing innovative interdisciplinary research on social media images.

We set up the Visual Social Media Lab (VSML) to facilitate knowledge exchange and to enable a strong online presence for this as well as our ongoing research.

We have developed a free online tool for collecting images and data from different social media platforms, available for free via the Statistical Cybermetrics Research Group at the University of Wolverhampton as part of the Webometric Analyst software: http://lexiurl.wlv.ac.uk/. With industry Co-I Pulsar, we further developed their state of the art technical infrastructure to benefit the project and to embed key ways of working beneficial to academic and commercial users. Training in both tools was offered as part of this project. Insight from the project has also been incorporated into the PIs postgraduate teaching on social media and through international guest teaching opportunities. 

Substantive research has focused on everyday image sharing and exceptional image sharing across two key strands of research.

Everyday image sharing was explored via a 12-month digital ethnography, which used three case studies to consider different users, practices and motivations in relation to online photographic sharing. Participants were recruited from a range of age groups, from rural and urban settings, and both professional and amateur photographers. The aim of all three case studies was to explore how photographs on a similar theme - namely, the city of Sheffield - are used to fulfill different personal and commercial objectives. This strand of research has resulted in a six-month secondment for the RA at the Food Standard Agency after the project completed; to explore the potential for different methods for analysing visual social media data within government. 

Exceptional image work focused on the images of three-year old Syrian refugee Alan Kurdi (originally misidentified as 'Aylan') taken by a Turkish press photographer after his body was found on Bodrum beach in Turkey, on 2 September 2015. These images were distributed to the mainstream media via wire services and subsequently circulated widely on social media, triggering further online and offline responses. These responses appear to have been driven by the accumulated momentum of the images as they were circulated and used across different contexts. This rapid response project, examining nearly 3 million image posts - involving researchers from the VSML and others - sought to explore this phenomenon and uses this case to consider the wider role of social media in the contemporary creation of iconic images. Findings from this project were published as a rapid response report in December 2015, which received wide international coverage. This wider strand of research has also resulted in an international collaboration with First Draft News for a funded PhD project to start in 2017. 

Finally, we sought to better understand users through focus groups and a large-scale survey, focused on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and WhatsApp. We asked questions about both everyday image sharing as well as exceptional image sharing. The results of the focus groups and the survey have highlighted the importance of doing this work longitudinally in order to better understand how online image sharing practices shape society over time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has been taken forward in different ways beyond academia and we will continue to build on this. Results from our rapid response report have been taken up in numerous ways, including by the World Economic Forum, which the PI has been involved in since 2013. The project RA has since completing the project worked at the Food Standards Agency as part of a six-month secondment. Through the Visual Social Media Lab our research also attracted strong interest from industry, including citing our work in key international reports. These developments connect to these original impact indicators: 

(1) Evidence that those working in social research in government, policy-makers and think tanks are engaging with and actively using our research, for example by directly citing it in policy documents and briefings, or by inviting project team members directly to present/brief on the research; 
(2) Inclusion of the role of social media images and the visual web as one of the key priorities for the WEF's Global Agenda Council on Social Media's research and engagement agenda for 2014/2015; 
(3) Evidence that those working in industry are engaging with and actively using our research, for example by directly citing it or by inviting project team members to industry events and conferences;
(4) In general to see a wider engagement with social media images, which can be traced to our research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22531073-0C4C-44C8-8B28-DF09C204E444</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e179f3be3bc3.63454586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://visualsocialmedialab.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Webometric Analyst can be used to download images from Twitter or Tumblr.
