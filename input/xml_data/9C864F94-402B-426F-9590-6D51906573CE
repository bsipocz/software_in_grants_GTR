It is therefore the only available framework in which we can ask questions about the nature of the Big Ban near which the entire Universe was very small and so gravitational and quantum effects were both important. Singularities such as the Big Bang are points in spacetime where the classical description of physics beaks down. Although the existence of such singularities is implied by the equations of Einstein's gravity, physicists have long been hoping to find a quantum theory of gravity that will accurately describe the physics at the near the singularities. So far, string theory has been very successful in describing the physics of time independent singularities at points in space. However, singularities like the Big Bang, where spacetime becomes singular at an instant in time but is otherwise smooth, have remained mysterious. That such time-dependent spacetimes are highly significant is highlighted by the recent cosmological measurements, which imply the existence of dark energy driving the expansion of the Universe which makes our Universe inherently time-dependent. This observation poses a two-fold challenge for string theory: (i) how do strings propagate and interact in a spacetime with a non-zero dark energy, and (ii) how do we explain that the measured value of the dark energy in the Universe is so small, contrary to our current understanding of string theory and quantum field theory? With these issues in mind, I am currently working on understanding the physics of strings in time-dependent spacetimes. I am particularly interested in the early Universe, and how string theory deals with the initial singularity of the Big Bang. One likely possibility is that string theory will provide a way to resolve the singularity, replacing it by a smooth spacetime. We can gain an understanding by studying toy models of particularly simple time-dependent spacetimes, which are obtained by gluing together points in ordinary four dimensional flat spacetime. This is analogous to obtaining a cone by gluing together points on a piece of paper. Just as the tip of the cone is a singular point, spacetimes constructed by gluing points in flat space have a singularity but at a particular instant in time. With collaborators, I was one of the first to study spacetimes recently, and showed that dynamics of non-interacting strings suffers no pathologies. However, more work needs to be done to understand if the singularity can be resolved in a continuous fashion. Perhaps the most important theoretical development in the past decade is an explicit realisation of the idea of holography. In such a framework, string theory (which is a theory of gravity among other things) in a spacetime is described in terms of a particular gauge theory (a more complicated version of electromagnetism) without gravity living on the boundary of the spacetime (akin to a hologram encoding details of three dimensional reality on a two dimensional photographic plate). This idea has been motivated by study of black holes in gravitational theories which revealed that the number of degrees of freedom in a region of space is proportional to the area of the region's boundary rather than it volume. Particular spacetimes for which such a description has been recently understood are called anti-de Sitter spaces, which are time-independent spacetimes. It is of particular interest to obtain D-branes (which are extended objects in string theory) which will perhaps lead to such a holographic description in a way similar to how static D-branes led to the holographic description of string theory in anti-de Sitter spaces. In the near future, I will continue to explore issues pertaining to time-dependence and the fate of singularities such as the Big Bang in</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PP/C50496X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A50650F5-D901-49C3-AA30-F625AC696676</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle Astrophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C2898760-D7E5-4B25-A236-E7869CD74F88</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - experiment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>200B9B9B-68EC-4D70-B889-6BD5F4538080</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Beyond the Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>760D5B7E-1353-4BD7-8172-CFFC4A254A5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cosmology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
