Potential beneficiaries of this research include people from economic and financial sectors, management and business sectors, governmental sectors (including central banks, health sectors, public services sector, etc), as well as various international organizations.

General Non-academic Beneficiaries:
This project promises innovative methodological and empirical contributions in the theory and practice in the broad realm of statistics. Statistics is a vital tool for understanding and managing data and uncertainties arising from every aspect of life. As such, in the most general way, this project has potential significant impacts on our society through its contributions and benefits to a wide range of sectors and communities whose business routinely depend on statistical analysis.

Specific Non-academic Beneficiaries:
Since this project also spans across a number of fields of research, specific benefits, justifications, and potential non-academic beneficiaries are detailed below.

[1] Users concerned with interest rates dynamics:
This project promises a new approach and empirical contributions for modelling interest rate dynamics. This new approach offers additional flexibility and efficiency than that of existing models. Empirical applications will concern practical issues such as estimating term structure of interest rates and valuing interest rate derivatives. Economic, financial and business sectors, central banks, and other governmental sectors may all benefit from the methodological and empirical contributions of this research in modelling interest rates.

[2] Users concerned with economic policies:
In the realm of multivariate analysis which mainly concerns the dependency among variables and their dynamic interactions, this research offers an additional tool for understanding and predicting the effects of government policies on the reaction and performance of the economy in both short and longer terms. Economic, financial, business sectors, central banks, and other policy makers are obvious beneficiaries. For example, better understanding of the dynamic effects of interest rates on other major economic indicators such as inflation, unemployment, and growth will help policy makers (e.g. national central banks, International Monetary Funds, World Bank) in their monetary decisions.

[3] Users concerned with forecasting:
In the realm of time series analysis, the proposed model, with its enhanced effectiveness, potentially helps to improve forecast accuracy. This will yield enormous benefits for people from various sectors whose decisions depend on the prediction of stochastic quantities. Forecasts that have profound implications on our society include economic and business forecasts, weather forecasts, forecasts of spread of diseases, as well as many others.

[4] Users concerned with optimal control and risk management:
In the realm of stochastic analysis, the proposed new stochastic model potentially leads to improved ability in the optimal control of stochastic quantities and management of risks. Engineers may benefit from this research in the optimal control process in the design of machineries; Risk managers may benefit from this project in their ability in controlling and managing risks.

[5] Users concerned with asset valuation:
In the realm of asset pricing, the proposed research promises a new continuous-time model for financial variables, which forms the basis for developing new valuation mechanisms for pricing financial assets such as the interest rate derivatives. More effective valuation of financial assets improves the efficiency of financial markets and allocation of resources. Potential beneficiaries include investment banks, hedge funds companies, asset management companies, pension funds, and financial regulation organizations, etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77453</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University?</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Speci cation Analysis in Regime-Switching Continuous-Time Diffusion Models for Market Volatility</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE590278-3F10-4F8C-A02A-3CAA063DE448</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The title &amp;quot;Speci cation Analysis in Regime-Switching Continuous-Time Diffusion Models for Market Volatility&amp;quot; is in the second round of review by the journal &amp;quot;Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Econometrics&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99133f14b69.72488438-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My partner is mainly responsible for the data collection, simulation, and empirical analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I am the leader of this ongoing project where I initiate the research idea.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nonparametric Transformation Models of Stochastic Processes</gtr:description><gtr:id>1ADDA533-3972-4959-B383-9C78F57A5B06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is still on-going and in its preliminary stage.

To maximize the potential impact, we took as many measures promised in our pathways to impact statement as we possibly could during and after the life this project. These include creating a dedicated webpage providing access to the progress of this project, circulating and promoting the concept and methodology of this project via university networks, industrial and business related meetings, and so on. 

One year since the end of the project, our research has indeed attracted the attention and interest of several non-academic organizations. These include a Chinese consultation company specialised in the modelling energy consumption dynamics in China's rural areas, a Shanghai-based fund management company promised to use advanced modelling and trading techniques for investing in the Chinese equity and futures markets. They are generally interested in our innovative methodology for modelling energy consumption dynamics and volatility dynamics of Chinese stock and futures markets, respectively, for risk control purposes. What is particularly encouraging is that we have been contacted by the Federal Reserve Board at Washington DC regarding the feasibility and suitability of applying our new methodology for extracting information from options on natural gas futures. As we are completing this summary, we are continuing our conversations with all three organizations in an effort to assist them to realize the maximum possible practical relevance and potential impact of our methodology to their investment strategy, risk management, and even policy-makings.

Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning in this summary that it has been no more than 12 months since the end of this project. In research impact terms, this is a relatively short period of time, considering the fact that the complete set of research outcome from this project have yet to be fully published mainly due to the usual long but rigorous journal review processes. Therefore, the impact of academic research usually takes significantly longer than a year to fully realize its potential. However, as investigators of this project, we are fully committed to our impact pathways to maximize the reward of this project in terms of impact to the society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C5EE32E5-568B-4114-95C3-B215CA38E3F5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55900ef93e6db6.94394831</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(Overview)
This project aimed to develop new econometric methods for flexibly and efficiently modelling the dynamics of key economic variables such as the short-term interest rates. The project was fruitful in that it successfully generated four research papers, two new research projects, one new research grant, and two new research partnerships.

(New Knowledge and Methods)
We formally established that Reducible Diffusion (RDs), which formed the foundation of our methodology, are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamics. Since RDs are nonlinear transformations of analytically tractable Underlying Parametric Diffusions (UPDs), they are substantially more flexible than conventional parametric diffusions and sufficiently tractable for making efficient statistical inference. The main achievement of this project is the development of four novel econometric methods for modelling RDs with applications to short-term interest rates.

Firstly, we proposed a new univariate parametric RD model with time-varying transformations. Our time-varying specifications can potentially account for autoregressive, threshold, smooth-transition, and regime-switching types of empirically relevant dynamic effects, which significantly improved the goodness-of-fit to short-rate data.

Secondly, we proposed a novel three-stage procedure for modelling multivariate short-rate series using a combination of univariate RDs and copulas. This approach is extremely flexible as it allows the users to model independently: (i) the time-invariant marginal distribution of individual series, (ii) the time-series dynamics of individual series, and (iii) most importantly the time-varying nonlinear dependence between multiple series. We derived the asymptotic distributions of the three-stage maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters.

Thirdly, we proposed a novel semiparametric univariate RD model which is crucially assumed to be an unknown transformation of a UPD. This approach yields a general class of dynamic models with parametric dynamic copulas and nonparametric marginal distribution. Very rich and complex dynamics can be generated by this model and its implementation is convenient and efficient. We derived the asymptotic distributions of the estimators of the nonparametric transformation function and the parametric component and studied their finite sample properties.

Finally, we proposed a unified framework for modelling multivariate RDs in both parametric and semiparametric settings. This framework crucially assumes that our multivariate RDs are the so-called triangular transformation of tractable multivariate UPDs. This triangular structure induces significant flexibility while preserving substantial tractability. We investigated the issues of identification and likelihood-based inference and examined the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators.

(New Research Questions, Collaborations and Funding Opportunity)
This project opened two important new research questions: (i) How to generalize our model so that the UPD can have latent components (e.g. stochastic volatility) and hence introduce additional empirically relevant flexibility? (ii) How to generalize our model so that the underlying parametric process can be non-stationary and possibly have jump components? 

These research questions have created collaborations between the PI and leading experts in this field. Specifically, the PI is collaborating with Prof. Dennis Kristensen (University College London) on Project (i) and with Prof. Jihyun Kim (Toulouse School of Economics) on Project (ii).

Moreover, the PI has secured new funding from British Academy for the next 18 months on Project (ii).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While the main contributions of this project are primarily theoretical and methodological, our key findings have clear fundamental importance and profound implications for both academic and non-academic users in predominantly, but not limited to, the areas of statistical and economic analyses.

Academic users from a broad range of disciplines, such as statistics, economics, finance, biology, engineering, and so on, can potentially benefit significantly from the novel concept of stochastic modelling using Reducible Diffusions. More specifically, on one hand theoretical researchers from these disciplines can use our contributions to the theory of stochastic and econometric analyses as the foundation for further exploration of this useful framework with enhanced breadth and depth. On the other hand, empirical researchers from the same disciplines can directly use the new statistical models developed from this project, either as alternative or complementary tools, to improve the flexibility and efficiency in modelling random phenomena of their interests.

Non-academic users, such as central banks, financial sectors, private business, biological, and engineering companies, etc., can similarly use the models developed from this project as additional tools to improve their understanding of, for example, economic dynamics, financial markets behaviour, asset valuation methods, investment and risk management strategies, and so on.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D7A4DD4-846E-440F-9970-6B8E67380593</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f8ccb03af53.76695298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Our new semiparametric approach for modelling nonlinear univariate diffusions assumes that the observed processes are nonparametric transformations of underlying parametric diffusions (UPDs). This modelling strategy yields a general class of semiparametric Markov diffusion models with parametric dynamic copulas and nonparametric marginal distributions. We show that this new class of diffusions can generate rich and complex nonlinear dynamics while at the same time admit closed-form transition densities. We provide primitive conditions for the identification of the UPD parameters together with the unknown transformations from discrete samples. vn-consistent semiparametric likelihood-based estimators of the UPD parameters as well as kernel-based drift and diffusion estimators are constructed, which are shown to be normally distributed in large samples. Our simulation study shows that the finite sample performance of our estimators performs closely to the fully parametric ML estimator.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4176FCD4-505F-44B2-AD9D-5BA9DA1F45F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research has potential significant impacts on a wide range of non-academic sectors both in the UK and worldwide.

Hence, by construction RDs are analytically tractable and flexible diffusion processes. Existing literature on RDs has mostly focused on time-homogeneous transformations, which to a significant extent fail to explore the full potential of RDs from both theoretical and practical point of views. In this paper, we propose flexible and economically justifiable time variations to the transformations of RDs. Concentrating on the Constant Elasticity Variance (CEV) RDs, we consider nonlinear dynamics for our time-varying transformations with both deterministic and stochastic designs. Such time variations can greatly enhance the flexibility of RDs while maintain sufficient tractability of the resulting models. In the meantime, our modelling approach enjoys the benefits of classical inferential techniques such as the Maximum Likelihood (ML). Our application to UK and US short-term interest rates suggests that from an empirical point of view time-varying transformations are highly relevant and statistically significant. We expect that the proposed models can describe more truthfully the dynamic time-varying behavior of economic and financial variables and potentially improve out-of-sample forecasts significantly.</gtr:description><gtr:id>73FF9607-333E-4AE7-8066-AEAA36263020</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research has potential significant impacts on real world financial modelers intending to capture time-variation in the stochastic financial variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, financial market volatility.

In the meantime, they maintain sufficient tractability inherited from the more tractable UPDs. In a series of papers based on the findings from the ESRC funded project (ES/J00622X/1), we developed novel parametric and semiparametric methods for modelling univariate as well as multivariate RDs. Empirical evidence suggests that our new models are flexible enough to capture vital empirical features of economic variables such as the short-term interest rates while at the same time statistically efficient likelihood-based inference can be conveniently implemented for our models.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B327072-C502-41DA-9E95-27F00D7CF657</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet available</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54628ed76c98c1.39525154</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Modelling Stochastic Processes using Reducible Diffusions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Parametric transformed diffusion models where the transformation function is identified from the parametric marginal distribution of the data.
