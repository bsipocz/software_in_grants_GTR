There is an increase in the frequency of heart attacks immediately after serious lung infections, although why this might happen is not clear. The two events may occur in proximity because people at risk of heart attacks are at increased risk of pneumonia but it is also possible that the response to lung infection increases the risk of a heart attack. Atherosclerotic plaques are lesions in blood vessels that are associated with the risk of developing a heart attack. When an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, a clot forms and blocks the blood vessel, causing a heart attack. Inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque makes plaques more likely to rupture and the body's response to infection results in both local and widespread inflammation. In this project I will test the possibility that the body's response to pneumonia, a severe form of lung infection, leads to inflammation in the atherosclerotic plaque and produces changes that are likely to cause plaque rupture and a heart attack. I will also test whether a specific cell that is part of the immune system, called a macrophage, is responsible for these changes. Macrophages are known both to fight infections and also to be present in atherosclerotic plaques. To test the mechanism of links between pneumonia and heart attacks I will combine mouse models of atherosclerotic plaque formation with those of pneumonia, that have been set up by my two supervisors, using these to test if pneumonia alters the composition of the atherosclerotic plaque. In my preliminary work I have shown that I can effectively combine these and have found evidence that the atherosclerotic plaque becomes larger after pneumonia. I will use established methods of manipulating macrophage populations in these models to determine if the macrophage is the cause of the changes that occur in the plaque after pneumonia. I will also test if drugs, termed statins, that reduce the level of harmful fat in the blood (cholesterol) can limit the effect of the infection on plaques, thereby potentially preventing a heart attack. My aim is to improve our understanding of how pneumonia increases the risk of a heart attack and identify the way it causes this complication so that we can discover new ways to prevent it. I also aim to find out if using a commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering medicine can prevent this complication from occurring. Since pneumonia and heart attacks are very common, this research has the potential to make a big impact on reducing the incidence of a common cause of premature death.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Clinical and epidemiological data suggests that community-acquired pneumonia triggers acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The mechanistic basis of this association is not established and there are few models of post-pneumonic atherosclerotic plaque formation. I predict that pneumonia induces localised inflammatory changes in the atherosclerotic plaque and that plaque-associated macrophages mediate the alterations in plaque composition. I will test this hypothesis in a unique murine model of post-pneumonic plaque formation that I have developed.
I will use ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet and establish a resolving model of bacteraemic S. pneumoniae infection to create a model of the post-pneumonic plaque. Using this model, my objectives will be:
1. To investigate the effect of pneumonia on plaque size, inflammatory cell composition, smooth muscle content and macrophage transcriptome and phenotype using advanced histopathological techniques including laser-capture microdissection.
2. To determine the role of plaque macrophages in post-pneumonic plaque formation using diphtheria toxin (DT) inducible or anti-CCR2 antibody mediated macrophage depletion in this murine model. 
3. To establish whether initiation of statin therapy at the time of pneumonia reverses the changes that characterise the post-pneumonic plaque.
The scientific opportunities which this work will create will arise from the identification of a mechanistic basis for the association of ACS with pneumonia, which has the potential to identify novel aspects of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques applicable in other clinical settings as well. The medical potential will stem from the identification of new therapeutic strategies to reverse changes in the atherosclerotic plaque and from the identification of a major clinical indication that should lead to implementation of this preventive strategy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>NHS: This project has the potential to change the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), suggesting that statins, or potentially other agents, can prevent acute coronary syndromes (ACS) after pneumonia. The first implication of this research would be the need to perform prospective public health studies to confirm the association of CAP with ACS and to perform clinical trials of statins and other agents and determine if they reduce ACS (impact 3-5 years). This would then lead to changes in CAP practice guidelines, ensuring close monitoring for the development of ACS, and the use of statins or novel pharmacotherapies to prevent ACS (5-10 years).
Patient groups: The project would have impact on patients who develop or are at increased risk of CAP (e.g. those with chronic lung disease) or coronary artery disease. The information will be important for patient charities including the British Lung Foundation and the British Heart Foundation. Patient education regarding the need for vigilance for the signs and symptoms of ACS following CAP would be an important and necessary development in the light of this research as would increased attention to the management of respiratory infections in those at risk of ACS. There would also be indirect impact by highlighting the importance of cardiac risk factors in patients with infection (immediate to medium term impact 0-5 years). 
General public: The link between infection and cardiovascular disease has received little attention amongst the wider general public. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this link would raise awareness in people about this relationship and by highlighting cardiovascular risk may influence health behaviours such as improving vaccine uptake and seeking early treatment for chest infections, as well as general attention to cardiovascular risk (immediate to medium term impact 0-5 years).
Education: Evidence for a causal relationship between respiratory infection and ACS would be important to communicate to school children through established outreach programmes and would eventually receive more attention in school science lessons, and will influence University science curricula (immediate to medium term impact 0-5 years). 
Public sector: Cardiovascular disease is the leading case of mortality worldwide, while CAP is the most common infection related cause for hospital admission. These illnesses therefore have major economic implications both in terms of time lost by the work force and the cost of treating them. Preventing CAP-related ACS would reduce the duration of hospital admission and the level of support required for patients (medium to long term impact 5-10 years). 
Industry: The identification of new pathways altering atherosclerotic plaque composition and stability would be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, identifying new targets for therapy. Existing close links between Professor Dockrell and ABPI contacts have developed through the MRC-funded COPD-MAP and will allow immediate interaction with industry to enable rapid translation of findings into novel therapies (medium to long term impact 5-10 years). 
Policy makers: This research will influence those charged with formulating public health policies, clinical guidelines and resource allocation strategies (medium to long term 5-10 years).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>270461</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Sitran</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8CC5E2C-3CE3-46B7-A177-5D64DAA9E740</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Microarray data from atherosclerotic plaque macrophages in ApoE -/- mice infected with S. pneumoniae or mock infected.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c86746771ef0.18895855-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The team from SITRAN contributed their expertise with regard to laser capture microdissection, RNA extraction and microarray experiments.
