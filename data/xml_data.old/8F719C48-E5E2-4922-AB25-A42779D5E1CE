&lt;p>This project examines the determinates of asylum appeal success at a variety of courts in the UK. It examines a range of factors include case-, court- and process-specific variables. It aims to develop theoretically and empirically rich connections between law and geography; utilise a range of methods including participant observation, statistical analysis and interviewing; and help to improve legal decision making with geographical and ethnographic knowledge.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project aims to make a significant impact beyond the university by creating knowledge that will be useful to elite legal decision makers and institutions, asylum seekers and their legal representatives. To this end it will result in the publication of both an interim and final report that will be disseminated among the legal community working in the area of immigration and asylum law.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who benefits?

Five groups will benefit from the research. First, the Ministry of Justice oversees the process of asylum appeal claims and this research will provide an insight into the variability of the process which in turn will highlight ways in which it can be made more consistent across courts and cases. Since fairness, equal opportunities, justice and the independence of judges are all central principles of the Ministry of Justice, they stand to benefit from this research in so far as it will allow them to pursue these principles further. Second, immigration law firms will benefit. The immigration law practitioners' association lists around 200 members operating in England, Wales and Scotland. Third, asylum support groups, charities and MPs/Lords with concerns for asylum seekers will benefit from the proposed research. 22 MSPs and 3 MPs have expressed their desire to see the research completed and to hear the findings of the project. This group includes representatives of two cross party asylum support groups in the Scottish Parliament and at Westminster (the Welsh Assembly was also contacted and a reponse has been promised). Baroness Bakewell, who has asked questions in the House of Lords on issues relating to immigration appeals, has also expressed her interest in the project (for all letters of support, including the Scottish Parliamentary motion in support of the project, see attachments). This group also includes the project partners on the steering committee for the project who have each pledges resources (Red Cross, Bail for Immigration Detainees and the Refugee Council), as well as the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association (Brennan, consultant, is SW head) and a range of charities and lobby groups (e.g. Refugee Action). Fourth, the research will benefit asylum seekers themselves. Fifth, a wider group of lawyers and professional legal bodies, outside immigration law, will benefit.

How will they benefit?

The Ministry of Justice will benefit because the findings will allow them to put in place policies that will ensure a fairer and more just treatment of asylum appeals, thereby fulfilling their mandate. For example, the research may cause the Ministry to review the methods used to promote consistency and share best practice across courts or regional asylum teams (who make initial decisions on asylum claims). It may also cause the Ministry to examine the information and training that is available to specific groups of judges and/or Home Office presenting officers.

Immigration law firms will become empowered with knowledge about the conditions under which asylum appeals are likely to be successful. This will allow them to shift resources into productive channels and be informed about strategies that could lead to successful outcomes e.g. the research will be able to identify the optimal approach of the lawyer, location of hearing and length of representation, all of which the firms have partial control over.

Asylum support groups and charities, cross-party parliamentary groups concerned with asylum seekers and ministers with a concern for asylum will benefit by being able to use well-informed, statistically accurate research to support their interactions with a range of professional and statutory bodies, including the Minister for Immigration, the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA), the Legal Services Commission (LSC) and other members of Parliament, in order to promote actions that lead to a more consistent asylum appeal system.

Asylum seekers may benefit if their appeal cases can be constructed in the light of richer knowledge of the asylum appeal system. They will also be treated in a fairer and more consistent manner as a result of the execution of this research.

A wider group of non-immigration law firms and professional legal bodies will benefit from the research if factors are identified that are i) related to the outcome of court processes but ii) are not specific to immigration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404171</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>From Outcomes to Process: Assessing Differences in Asylum Appeals</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7C3BFB9-951D-4EB1-B2C1-2E2D35A8A1C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Presenter to South West Migration Partnership, Taunton.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5731900255.8774310ca05eb6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/Parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ethnographic Research into Asylum Appeals in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>7AABF155-0783-45D6-8397-0346D169443B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Opening Speakers, Workshop on Migration &amp;amp; Asylum Policies in Europe organised by Carolina Kobelinsky (2012-13 Deakin Fellow of the European Studies Centres, Oxford University), Oxford University</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2620667677.9507362b210618</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fair and Consistent?

The project has also developed a new way to understand systems of incarceration, focusing on the connections between institutions such as schools, prisons, hospitals and detention centres, rather than on the institutions themselves (which tends to produce an inhibited view of the flow of people, objects and practices between them). Thirdly, the project has employed statistical methods to examine the uses to which judges put their in-court procedural judicial discretion. The data shows that various factors are significantly correlated with the in-court behaviour of judges: from the timing of the hearings to characteristics of the litigants themselves. Fourthly, the project has developed insights into the role that distance plays in the regulation of human movement, noting how both proximity and remoteness can be conducive to exclusion.

A particularly noteworthy new methodology that has been developed concerns the surveying of large numbers of court or tribunal hearings in order to discern patterns in the behaviour of legal adjudicators. Most research that involves in-person observations of legal processes has been qualitative in nature to date, but the approach taken in this project has combined qualitative (ethnographies) and quantitative (survey) elements to develop this field. The findings open up the question of whether the sorts of phenomena found in the specific area of asylum and immigration tribunals in the UK that were observed in this project are reproduced in contexts outside these spheres: such as other countries or other areas of law.

Noteworthy research partnerships that have been developed through the life of the grant include a Europe-wide network of scholars who have studied asylum determination procedures in Europe ethnographically. This network will lead to an edited book entitled 'Asylum Determination in Europe: Ethnographic Perspectives' to be published by Palgrave. It will be the first book to bring together such detailed ethnographies of asylum determination.

The project has also already underpinned significant impact. Evidence from this project helped secure a High Court judgment that the Detained Fast Track (DFT) appeals process was unfair and unlawful. The Detained Fast Track was a system for speedy determination of asylum claims. The judgment was later upheld by the Court of Appeal, leading the government to suspend the entire DFT system in July 2015. Consequently, more than 300 asylum seekers in the fast-track process were released from detention. Any future British scheme to speed up the asylum process would have to meet stringent conditions, including setting clear and workable criteria for who goes onto the Fast Track, providing evidence to justify constraints on judges' powers to set timescales case-by-case, and providing evidence that the current approach is not working.

In summary, this research project has delivered a series of intellectual, methodological and practical insights, and opened up a set of pertinent research questions going forward.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are likely to be of use to immigration law practitioners as well as her majesty's courts and tribunals service and the ministry of justice. For immigration law practitioners, for example, a deeper understanding of the dynamics of legal exclusion may be useful for developing and targeting the scarce resources that they command. And for her majesty's courts and tribunals service and the ministry of justice, the patterns in judicial in-court behavioural discretion that the project has identified will be useful for improving the accessibility of court and tribunal procedures to vulnerable groups in a cost effective way. Upon publication of the quantitative work (currently accepted with minor revisions to Social &amp;amp; Legal studies) the research team will disseminate to both these groups through policy briefs. Moreover, 'Justice', an all-party law reform and human rights organisation working to strengthen the justice system in the United Kingdom, and which aims to act as 'the conscience of the legal profession', may be an appropriate avenue for further dissemination of the research findings.
