However, as these materials are reduced in size there comes a point where their properties change from what is commonly observed for bulk materials to a new behaviour that depends on the size of the structure in a particular direction. In this project we will investigate how very thin metal films grow on a crystal of another material. This other material is zinc oxide and is commonly used as a white pigment in paper or as an antiseptic in would dressings but it has some rather special properties. It can be made to be electrically conducting yet transparent so is useful for display technologies and solar panels; it can be made to emit laser light at high energy and also tends to grow in to very long thin wires which makes it useful as a gas sensor. All of these applications require an electrical contact to be made to the surface of the zinc oxide. Making such a contact is not generally easy as most metals do not wet oxide surfaces and tend to roll up into little balls (like water on an oily surface). However, zinc oxide is unusual as a combination of crystal structure (how the atoms are arranged in the crystal) and the charge on each atom leads to the formation of two surfaces on opposite sides of the crystal upon which metals do tend to wet (ie they spread out very thinly like oil on water). This unusual property means it is easy to grow very large but very thin metal layers, so thin in fact that their properties depend directly on their thickness. By controlling the thickness we can tune the properties of the film and effect electrical conduction, magnetic properties of the metal and chemical reactivity of the metal. In this project we will discover why metals spread out on these sort of surfaces and how to tune their properties so we can make useful devices and catalysts in the future which speed up devices, reduce our energy consumption or enable us to manufacture low carbon, efficient fuels and chemicals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9983</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Ultrathin Co films deposited at room temperature on the polar ZnO(0001) surfaces were investigated in situ using a combination of STM, LEED and XPS. The clean polar zinc terminated ZnO(0001) surface is heavily reconstructed with triangular add and vacancy islands. As-deposited films form a high density of metallic Co nanoparticles on the surface. Annealing the films in ultrahigh vacuum leads to the formation of a homogenous and smooth surface which is confirmed to be a mixed oxide by XPS. The change in surface roughness of the Co/ZnO(0001) films changes as a function of initial Co thickness. The removal of the triangular add and vacancy island reconstruction induced by the clean surface polarisation is surprising and we are working on models whereby cobalt-zinc mixed oxides can stabilise the surface termination.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Publication in preparation</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3CB4428C-57B8-41D3-8406-65C41BDDA9BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf8b974dbdd6.15588532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G067465/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C89BB7D-DCEF-4DCF-84DB-CA53C907AB0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Surfaces &amp; Interfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
