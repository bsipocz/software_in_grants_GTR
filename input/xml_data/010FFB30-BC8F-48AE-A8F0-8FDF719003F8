The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be faster and plants would grow faster. This speeding-up of photosynthesis will happen naturally over the next fifty years or so as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise due to human activities. However, there is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in tiny green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. We have recently discovered important new information about this mechanism, and we have invented new and rapid methods to discover algal genes that contribute to it. We have two complementary and parallel aims. First, we will apply our new methods to identify all of the genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and we will discover exactly how these genes work. Second, we will transfer the most important genes into a plant, and study whether the same CCM can be recreated inside a leaf. If it can, we expect that our experimental plant will have higher rates of photosynthesis and hence a higher rate of growth than normal plants. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to use the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) from green algae to enhance CO2 concentration in C3 chloroplasts, suppressing photorespiration and increasing productivity. The CAPP programme will discover and characterise components of the Chlamydomonas CCM, in addition to known bicarbonate pump(s) and carbonic anhydrases, identify pyrenoid components, supramolecular complexes and their chaperones, and progressively incorporate key components into Arabidopsis. Our approach includes: 1) Addition of a bicarbonate pump to the chloroplast envelope inner membrane (and removal of any CO2-channelling aquaporins: PIP1 sub-family) to maximize bicarbonate accumulation in the chloroplast. 2) Formation of ordered clusters of modified Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase in the chloroplast to benefit from local CO2 concentration at the active sites, and to distance the Rubisco from the site of O2 generation at PSII. 3) Discovery of genes required for the CCM in Chlamydomonas through a novel, high throughput insertional mutant screen and parallel, hypothesis-driven RNAi approaches 3) Progressive addition of newly-discovered CCM components into an Arabidopsis plant incorporating the above novel features, followed by characterisation of the metabolism and physiology of the lines thus generated 4) Mathematical modelling methods to identify constraints to carbon uptake and exchange in Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis, and to evaluate the improvement in carbon supply likely to arise as CCM components are added to Arabidopsis. The goal is to create an Arabidopsis 'Advanced Plant', with significantly improved rates of CO2 assimilation. This is a first step towards producing a crop plant with a 'biophysical' CCM that significantly improves productivity and yield.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 1.

The idea to develop a series of farms across India to teach women techniques from factoring climate into crop choice to improving yield is part of a programme to empower mid-career that saw 20 female scientists from India brought 23 delegates to visit the labs and lecture halls of Cambridge this week. 

Experts in plant and crop sciences from Indian and Cambridge exchanged skills and ideas during a five-day programme that included seminars, workshops and visits to laboratories.

Female scientists from across India applied to take part in the programme, with the first 20 staying at Clare College for a week and attending workshops on topics from building negotiation skills to delegating more effectively. According to the programme organisers, this was in order to help them &amp;quot;handle the juggling game of science and family&amp;quot;.

The visit included a tour of the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, the Innovation Farm at the National Institute Of&amp;nbsp;Agricultural Botany (NIAB) and the John Innes Centre (JIC). Ultimately, it is hoped that the Innovation Farm concept will also be developed at universities and research institutes across India to train women farmers in the latest agricultural techniques.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bbb351539037.11867081</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Member of CUPGRA executive committee</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EBC6BFD-7A37-463A-8E10-4F954305DA1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Facilitated discussions between academics and potato growing industry and opportunities for philanthropic support of research; CUPGRA was set up in 1982 to encourage study and research on potatoes.

The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be increased and plant productivity would be higher. There is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in unicellular green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. During the initial CAPP1 programme, we discovered important new information about this mechanism, and using new and rapid methods we have identified novel algal genes and additional regulatory components which allow the CCM to operate in association with a specific micro-compartment called a pyrenoid. We have also successfully introduced some of these components into a model higher plant, Arabidopsis, and also successfully introduced a modified form of Rubisco which may facilitate aggregation into the pyrenoid. The ambitious goals of the CAPP2 extension will be to combine the expression of the CCM and pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant.

Specifically, we have made substantial progress towards our original CAPP1 goals of expressing correctly-localized components of the Chlamydomonas CCM into a model C3 higher plant (Arabidopsis). We have also identified previously unknown algal CCM components, acquired new understanding of CCM regulation during day/night cycles, and started to generate an in vivo sensor for HCO3-. By the end of CAPP1, we have (i) an extensive list of novel genes associated with the CCM in Chlamydomonas (Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, US); (ii) new insights into regulation of chloroplast pyrenoid formation, intrathylakoid membrane organization and post-translational modification of CCM components during day/night cycles (Cambridge, UK); (iii) physiologically characterised Arabidopsis plants expressing several CCM components (the Advanced Plant) (John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The collaborative nature of the programme means
