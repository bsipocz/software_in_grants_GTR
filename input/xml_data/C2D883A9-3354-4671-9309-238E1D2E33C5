Policy makers and scientists communicate in their own jargon-centric languages, which leads to miscommunications and lack of understanding between the two groups. Consequently, scientific research may not be integrated in to the decision making process, with end users left either unaware of or not clearly understanding how science can support and inform management, adaptation and mitigation options. It is crucial that good scientific research supports the development of policy indicators and setting of environmental targets in order to successfully implement marine policy; the UK government could be held responsible for exceeding or not meeting these legally binding targets. 

This project seeks to promote the use of CPR science, expertise and data to support UK, EU, and international decision-making while identifying new opportunities and policy-relevant applications for SAHFOS data and science. The fellowship will integrate science-policy expertise and CPR data into the UK and EU political processes through the involvement in national and international pelagic expert groups, including leadership of the implementation of the MSFD for pelagic habitats at the UK and OSPAR levels, and membership on key UK and international policy boards. CPR data and research will be transformed to targeted policy-relevant scientific advice for UK, EU and international policy and decision makers, with particular focus on under-disseminated NERC-funded CPR research. New end users of CPR research and data will be identified in order to cultivate new knowledge exchange links and applications. Policy advice gaps and future needs will be assessed in order to steer CPR research towards policy relevance. These steps towards the effective application and development of CPR science will result in better evidence to support marine management and conservation. 

The applicant is experienced in engaging and communicating with UK, EU and international policy and decision makers, and drawing links between CPR research and policy needs and has a wide UK and EU science-policy network. However, her work is repeatedly constrained by funding limitations which have resulted in inefficiencies and boundaries to the effectiveness and reach of policy impact-generating activities. Many opportunities to create policy impact from CPR data are underfunded and revenue-earning contracts and projects are often necessarily prioritised. Although she is currently contributing to MSFD implementation and serving on evidence groups, the work is only partially and inconsistently funded and must be performed as limited resources allow. This KE Fellowship will remove the funding barrier to applying CPR science to policy implementation and facilitate the direct inclusion of CPR research and data into the UK and international policy process. The fellowship will enable the applicant to consistently and efficiently perform policy impact generating work in dedicated working time, and will allow her to better utilise her network of contacts to more effectively exploit CPR science. A key component will be the generation of policy impact for NERC-funded work which has never been disseminated - MSFD application of core contract microbial genetic research and international policy impact of the Global Alliance of CPR Surveys (GACS).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43388</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ISIS</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ICES WG BIODIV</gtr:description><gtr:id>216551E5-39B0-4F9A-9C0C-CF38EF36A821</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ICES, 2014.

Outcome: Development of MSFD indicators which form important contribution to EU and UK policy.
a. Evidence: Indicators and targets now legally binding in UK, accepted for international development in OSPAR.
b. Evidence: NERC-supported CPR data and research form key evidence source for informing and assessing indicators at UK and OSPAR levels.
c. Evidence: Input into development of UK plankton monitoring strategy which explicitly names the CPR survey as data contributor; advice sought on UK MSFD programme of management measures, which will be implemented to manage human pressure on marine waters.
d. Evidence: Representatives from multiple EU countries are now collaborating to develop regionally-cohesive OSPAR level policy indicators.
e. Evidence: Led development of plankton indicators which will be published as OSPAR Indicator Assessment Cards in 2017.
f. Reach and value: Robust delivery of MSFD meets EU legal requirements and avoids infraction for member states; progress towards sustainable marine management benefits all users of marine ecosystems.
2. Outcome: Progression of wider non-plankton aspects of MSFD implementation.
a. Evidence: Production of guidance on evaluation of indicator criteria through ICES WGBIODIV now in use in OSPAR implementation.
b. Evidence: Production of guidance on MSFD-climate change interactions through MCCIP now in review phase, soon to be published for use in implementation process.
c. Reach and value: Clear and practical guidance to support the MSFD's approach to management is used by scientists and policy makers in the implementation of individual member states (for example UK, NO, SE, NL, FR, BE) as well as collaboratively at the OSPAR level.
3. Outcome: Development of close working relationship with UK, European Commission and OSPAR policy makers through leadership roles in the UK and OSPAR level processes; facilitates effective and wide ranging application of CPR science to current policy needs and identification of upcoming opportunities to contribute.
a. Evidence: UK, EU and OSPAR policy makers contact me frequently for advice and I often approach them for input as well; these conversations are both informal and formal.
b. Evidence: Policy engagement facilitates production of personal research which is responsive to policy needs and useful to decision makers.
c. Evidence: Knowledge of policy needs used to influence CPR colleagues' research to address policy-relevant knowledge gaps.
d. Evidence: Increasingly asked to represent 'policy point of view' in scientific collaboration, raising the profile of the CPR and creating products useful to policy makers. For example, I am leading a policy-targeted 'Governance Guide' as part of a collaborative project. This guide will include two CPR science-policy case studies, demonstrating impact from the NERC-supported survey.
e. Reach and value: Availability to policy makers and reputation for open and cooperative communication ensures policy objectives at UK, OSPAR and EU levels are supported by the best available information and feature a CPR point of view; dissemination of CPR-policy throughout the wider scientific community, who may not normally be involved in science-policy work, encourages responsive research and consistent linking of research to policy needs.
4. Outcome: Targeted and accessible advice provided to the wider European and international science-policy communities has increased the use of science in decision making and has facilitated policy application of scientific research.
a. Evidence: Increasingly invited to speak as expert on applying science to policy and communicating across the science-policy interface (see http://planktonpolicy.org/publications/conference-presentationsposters/ for details). 
b. Evidence: Policy-targeted publications, which explicitly draw connections between science and policy needs, are written in clear and non-technical language and disseminated throughout the EU and internationally. These products are used by both science-policy advisors and policy makers to support decision making.
c. Evidence: Leading role in EU and international science-policy workshops as invited convenor/speaker/facilitator. A recent success occurred at a Tokyo science-policy workshop (&amp;quot;Towards the better collaboration between scientists and policy makers&amp;quot;) which brought scientists and policymakers together, an uncommon event in Japan. We identified key barriers inhibiting science-policy knowledge exchange and possible avenues to overcome them. The CPR survey was used as a successful example of a research programme which supports decision making. The best practices learned in the UK and Europe were adapted to guidelines that may be applied to incorporate science from the NERC-funded Going Global project, into the Japanese policy process.
d. Reach and value: These activities influence international science-policy advisors, pure scientists, and decision makers.
5. Outcome: Engagement with society raises awareness of plankton and the CPR and their importance at the science-policy interface.
a. Evidence: Public talk to adults as part of National Science and Engineering Week event addressed importance of plankton monitoring to policy. The venue was filled to capacity (~50 attendees).
b. Evidence: Engagement with the public through new NERC KE Fellowship-inspired blog (Plankton and Policy http://planktonpolicy.org/blog/) and social media (Twitter: @anaturalstate) disseminates policy work and research, stimulates conversation, and illustrates the humanity of science by incorporating personal points of view in scientific messages.

6. Outcome: Promotion of KE as a discipline raises awareness of importance of science-policy interface and increases respect for KE
 a. Evidence: Co-founded and co-chair of the Challenger Society for Marine Science Special Interest Group (SIG) which in only one year has gained 50 members
 b. Evidence: Co-hosted and co-convened an early career science-policy event at the Challenger 2016 Science Conference which was attended by approximately 100 delegates. We organised a panel of policy scientists, knowledge brokers and policy makers and had question and answer break out groups with attendees to guide them into working with policy.
 c. Evidence: Delivered multiple talks about my KE fellowship work, concentrating on how to start working with policy makers and motivating scientists to pursue this work
 d. Evidence: Co-authoring paper on monitoring, evaluation and response in science-policy with KE Fellow Prue Addison. I visited Prue in Cambridge and presented my fellowship work to her (mostly terrestrial) research group. It was a good opportunity to exchange points of view on my work and their conservation work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a492069b4083.20215518</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory
