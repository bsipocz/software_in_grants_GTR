Its advances will be of benefit to that inter- and multi-disciplinary set of academics, but also much more widely, including members of the public, arts administrators, the third-sector, educationalists and teachers, and artists. The kinds of ideology this proposal contests are not limited to the UK, so this research is international in its scope. The use of cultural audit, the promotion of entrenched hierarchies via conservative and consumerist dogma, and the assumption of commensurability via economic exchange are global phenomena. 

&amp;quot;Against Value in the Arts&amp;quot; sounds like a counter-intuitive way to go about describing and defending the value of the arts. This project proposes, however, that it is often the staunchest defenders of art who do it the most harm, by suppressing its dissenting voice, by neutralizing its painful truths, and by instrumentalizing its potentiality, so that rather than expanding the autonomy of thought and feeling of the artist and the audience, it makes art self-satisfied, or otherwise an echo-chamber for the limited self-description of people's desires. 

This project does not argue that the arts have no value; quite the opposite. It argues instead that value judgments can behave insidiously, and incorporate aesthetic, ethical or ideological values fundamentally opposed to the &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; they purportedly name and describe. It argues that even the most ostensibly virtuous of values can become oppressive when disseminated bureaucratically, and as a set of official renderings or statements of artistic accounts, also known as audit culture. 

&amp;quot;Against Value in the Arts&amp;quot; argues that the greatest possible value of the arts has been, and might continue to be to oppose, rigorously and constitutively, dominant and dominating ascriptions of value. 

&amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; proposes that the best way to engage critically with our society is to suspend presumptions of value, to engender instead a radical indeterminacy, to propose an incommensurability, the critique of any &amp;quot;common measure&amp;quot;, even if that common measure pretends to be as neutral as &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;. It seeks to antagonize questions about who gets to ascribe value, and how, and to interpret those ascriptions ideologically.

&amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; will attend to the following: 

 - The Value of &amp;quot;Value&amp;quot;. Is the promotion of value in and of itself a virtue? How does it become coercive? How might value in one sphere mean the degradation of value in another? How does value relate to commodification? How does value make assumptions damaging to experimentation and freedom? 

 - Theories of Audit. Description (always flawed, always partial) is installed as both aim and outcome by cultural auditing. Audit therefore alters the object it seeks to study. Auditing began in economics, but has since been taken up in management, and across the public sector, in part because it can be used to pursue political ends by those in power. How can we refuse to adhere to always partial &amp;quot;self-description&amp;quot;, as curtailed by the categories and presumed outcomes of the audit, on behalf of an open-ended, indeterminate, and patient record? How does auditing reflect on contemporary issues such as privacy? 

 - Theories of Exchange: Society is dominated by the exchange values, in particular, the belief that everything can be exchanged via the medium of money. 

 - Dissent, Democracy, Liberality, Emancipation, Trust, Care, Privacy. The project will conclude with reflections on alternative values, and the ways in which value, audit, and exchange may impact damagingly upon them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research from the &amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; project involves thirteen academics and artists from a diverse range of disciplines and artforms, including the history of art, anthropology, literature, languages, political science, music, philosophy, theatre, poetry and cultural studies.

We will publicize the outputs of the project, and its dialogue, in opinion-pieces in journals such as the LRB, the TES and TLS, as well as the broadsheet press. We understand the project speaks to a sympathetic audience, and to maximize its dissemination will take up every opportunity to extend its debate into the public sphere. Its potential controversy will afford it attention from journalists and other cultural bodies, including art and culture programming on television and radio. 

This research will impact the following: 

 - Policy. &amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; is aimed, ultimately, at changing policy on a number of fronts, or rather to provide the theoretical background so that new policies can develop in the future. It will provide critical arguments which can be used to confront mistaken policies across arts administration and higher education. Though clearly work infused with a critical spirit it hopes to be energizing and productive for artists, arts adminsistrators, funders, and academics by providing a defense of their work that is not reliant on contemporary trends in audit, and by demonstrating a keen intellectual solidarity with those currently struggling against various kinds of social damage. 

 - Arts and education administration. &amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; will help shape the next round of funding calls in the AHRC's Cultural Value Project, allowing for greater critical and dissenting voice. It understands that the disagreement with those who seek to reduce the funding of the arts, whether in terms of public or private money, cannot, in the end, be swayed by pragmatic economic considerations, that if the arts and education communities choose to defend themselves on economic grounds they will fail, because economic arguments can too readily be used for ideological ends. We must recognise the divisive and hierarchical policies of the past number of years for what they are, and respond by changing the terms of the debate. 

 - Artists. &amp;quot;Against Value&amp;quot; will benefit artists across disciplines by making apparent the dangers of self-auditing, the replacement of intellectual autonomy with a bureaucratized view of their own research and purpose. 

 - Public. It will speak to members of the public sympathetic to many of its tasks, for example those contesting the dominance of audit in their lines of work, or those contesting the use of those audits to ideological ends, or those sympathetic to the struggle against the domination of social life by economic dogma, and those who wield economic dogma for socially regressive aims.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26670</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Against Value 'critical review' has been submitted to the AHRC college. It argues that funders should make claims of value for the arts and culture more complex, that they should understand the counterintuitive results of the auditing of values, i.e., that values can be damaged by their auditing, and that artworks broadly understood may well rightly stand in opposition to dominant and dominating notions of cultural, ethical, social and economic value, even when those values are ostensibly virtuous. 

This critical review feeds into reflections by the AHRC on the way in which it understands, describes and defends the value of the arts, in light of its funding obligations. The conclusion to the critical review advocated a model of ethnographic listening. It reads, 'listening, which is not itself of necessity or absolutely a virtue, is a practice and methodology of incommensurability. The question of the value of the arts shouldn't be answered. An ethnographic model of listening is preferable to a value-laden audit culture (aims and outcomes) for arts funding in order to maintain the incommensurability of the arts from its host cultures, and culture from society. This is to make sure to fail (to fail better) to repress a critical dissensus from dominant and dominating systems of value, to look askance at the impropriety of irrecuperable artworks, and to save the arts from its defenders.' 

There have been a number of smaller examples of the way the thesis of Against Value enters into debates. For example DanceHE referred to the Against Value thesis in its 'Independent Dance Higher Education Roundtable in September 2014. As the Against Value project is promoted via talks and publications in the coming years I will update these impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>85F81A4E-BF88-422E-8D08-BD354ACE090E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cf5d00e49f3.66271530</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research carried out for Against Value in the Arts as part of the AHRCs Cultural Value Project was submitted to the AHRC as a 'critical review'. 

The Critical Review contends that we live in what the social anthropologist Marilyn Strathern describes as an 'audit culture'. Audit culture describes a set of practices that have extended from economics, through management and into education and arts' administration. Against Value demonstrates that these practices do not simply describe their subjects, but actively alters the culture which they seek to describe. 

Against Value provides a critical and theoretical account of 'value'.

Against Value advocates for the suspension, negation or dissent from value since value is used as a coercive function within an audit culture. 

Against Value proposes a number of alternative values, and pre-empt the ways in which they too may be damaged by the auditing of cultural value. 

Against Value proves the thesis that one of the greatest possible value of the arts has been, and might continue be to suspend, negate or oppose, rigorously and constitutively, dominant and dominating ascriptions of value.

Against Value articulates the current discourse around value as part of a constrictive consensus to which can be opposed Jacques Ranci&amp;egrave;re's theory of dissensus: 'the political persists as long as there is a dissensus about the givens of a particular situation'.

Against Value understands that the auditing of values pervades the fabric of people's work-lives and increasingly their everyday. 'Positive' values (happiness, participation, transparency) become damaging when enforced by audit and the genealogy of value uncovers figures of resentment, disenchantment and alienation fostered by a combination of domination by exchange-value and the complicity in that system of social and cultural values. 

Against Value argues that the arts can, and perhaps should, be critical of iterations of value, no matter how ostensibly virtuous are those values. It is often the staunchest defenders of art who do it the most harm, by suppressing or mollifying its dissenting voice, by neutralizing its painful truths, and by instrumentalizing its potentiality, so that rather than expanding the autonomy of thought and feeling of the artist and the audience, it makes art self-satisfied, or otherwise an echo-chamber for the limited and limiting self-description of people's lives. 

The conclusion proposes that an ethnographic model of listening is preferable to a value-laden audit culture (aims and outcomes) for arts funding in order to maintain the incommensurability of the arts from its host cultures, and culture from society. This is to encourage a critical dissensus from dominant systems of value. The practice to be developed is &amp;quot;being able to pay attention to people who themselves have other things on their minds&amp;quot; (Strathern).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Against Value project continues.
