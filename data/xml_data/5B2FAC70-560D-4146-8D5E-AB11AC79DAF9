The project derives from archival research conducted at the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art, Washington D.C., Woodstock Artists' Association and Museum, New York, and in New Mexico at the University of New Mexico, the National Hispanic Cultural Center (Albuquerque), Harwood Foundation (Taos), State Archives, Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of New Mexico's Fray Angelico Ch&amp;aacute;vez History Library and Photographic Archives, and the Museum of International Folk Art (Santa Fe). 
 
This is the first book to consider Spanish-speaking Hispano artists as integral to the history of modernism in New Mexico. I explore innovation in Hispano art, in form, technique, iconography and subject matter, across a range of media, including painting, sculpture and photography, by recovering three much-neglected figures: santero sculptor Patrocinio Barela, black-and-white art photographer John Candelario, and painter Edward Ch&amp;aacute;vez. These three artists broke new ground in Hispano art at a time when mainstream modernism was making its mark in New Mexico and prevailing primitivist discourses viewed Hispanos as traditional craftspeople, folk, primitive and outsider artists. While Anglo-American modernist writers, artists and patrons found inspiration in New Mexico's native communities, Barela, Candelario and Ch&amp;aacute;vez became pioneers in their own right, by mediating their artistic traditions with the new aesthetic forms, markets and cross-cultural encounters that accompanied the revival and preservation of local culture from the 1920s into the New Deal. Alongside other Hispano artists of their generation, these individuals negotiated multiple social, cultural and economic worlds between 1930 and 1960. As cultural brokers, they melded elements of mainstream modernist culture with their ethnic heage, challenging purist notions of Hispano art, particularly the elevation of 'authentic' Spanish colonial art through local markets such as Spanish and Native Market, and the limits of mainstream modernism. Barela, Candelario and Ch&amp;aacute;vez developed a critical modernism, an experimental and transcultural aesthetic that expressed an ambivalent relationship to mainstream society and modernity, and a desire to reclaim local culture as Anglo tourists, writers, and artists began appropriating it. In doing so, they established a precedent for contemporary Hispano artists who continue to challenge purist notions of art and the power of Anglo-dominated markets. 
 
The project begins by examining the new markets, cultural hierarchies and systems of patronage that underpinned the Anglo-led revival and preservation of Hispano arts from the 1920s into the New Deal. It documents the commodification of local art forms through tourism and the curio trade and, in particular, the elevation of traditional Spanish colonial artifacts as a model for translating Hispano art. Hispanos responded to modernist primitivism and the revival, preservation and appropriation of local art forms in various ways. After considering artistic innovation at the local level by artists who worked for the Spanish Colonial Arts Society, Native Market and the New Deal's Federal Art Project, the book focuses in on three artist case studies: Barela, Candelario and Ch&amp;aacute;vez. The book concludes by exploring their impact on contemporary Hispano aesthetics and identity formation in the context of a new 'revival' in Spanish colonial art and the creation of alternative markets for experimental Hispano artists such as Luis Tapia, Nicholas Herrera, Marion Martinez, Miguel Gandert, Ray Martin Abeyta and Orlando Leyba.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This interdisciplinary project broadens the boundaries of key fields by reframing the narrative of modernist American art and by inserting Hispano cultural history into the more radical, politicised debates about artistic practice and identity within Chicano Studies and Latino Studies, fields from which Hispanos are generally sidelined. The interdisciplinary dynamic of my project has already generated a two-day international symposium on the visual arts funded by the Terra Foundation for American Art in Chicago. In April this year I organised 'Art Across Frontiers: Cross-Cultural Encounters in America', which brought together eleven US and European speakers. The symposium's key objective was to reach a multi- and interdisciplinary audience of artists, scholars and curators (along with the publication of a special issue), and the event has laid the foundation for future workshops based on interdisciplinary thinking, collaborative research and international exchange. 

This book's focus on the power of cultural production and representation and the politics of tourism and the marketplace will generate impact in other ways. The project has much potential to inform debates about contemporary cultural policy, public art and public history, and to capture a general readership interested in regional history and the art market, including a non-academic audience of curators and cultural activists. I have already delivered a public lecture on the politics of cultural ownership in Hispano photography during my fellowship at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas. By exploring the dynamics of New Mexico's contemporary art scene and ethnic political landscape, the book's final section addresses concerns that retain currency for Hispanos who remain disenfranchised from local art markets in Santa Fe and Taos, and from national and institutional narratives about modern and contemporary art. My interviews with contemporary Hispano artists Miguel Gandert, Miguel Padilla and Alex Ch&amp;aacute;vez, as well as interviews with the family of modernist photographer John Candelario, reflect ongoing battles related to the politics of the museum and the marketplace. Indeed, my research on Candelario and my interviews with his son (with whom I've undertaken extensive communication), have generated initiatives directly related to the politics of the museum. Despite working alongside Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe, as well as gaining international renown in 1946 with fellowship in the Royal Photographic Society of Britain, Candelario remains a curiously neglected figure in contemporary debates about American modernist photography and he is rarely exhibited outside New Mexico. With Candelario's son, I am in conversation with the D H Lawrence Centre at Durban House, Nottingham, regarding the possibility of staging a small-scale exhibition and/or donating several of Candelario's photographs to the Centre. Candelario forged strong ties to the Lawrences through Mabel Dodge Luhan, having photographed and interviewed Frieda Lawrence in the 1940s. The exhibition would be twinned with a public lecture on Candelario, with scope for further public workshops on transatlantic connections in modernist culture. 

The project has already redirected my teaching interests, generating a new, pioneering undergraduate module on Latino Expressive Culture. As well as plans to introduce a new, team-taught undergraduate module on modernism in the visual and literary arts, these initiatives will also structure educational outreach programmes in local schools and further education colleges. Using my experience teaching on the University's Widening Participation Scheme since 2005 and my new role as Arts Faculty Widening Participation Officer, I will offer sessions based on historical and comparative explorations into photography, museum display and public art.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38060</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Outreach event for Year 12 students</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3BA8D31-ECF7-408E-82A1-E4773AAE9234</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My research on Latino art was integrated into an outreach event for Year 12 students from UK state-maintained schools.

It is likely that the outreach sessions as a whole influenced pupils' decisions about studying in higher education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6689060988.5464060c120170</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gallery talk and YouTube interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>933B2F50-FFF7-4563-BCE3-7237436B588F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the public attended a gallery walkthrough and asked questions about the place of Chicano art and individual artworks.

Impact relating to the research at this stage is embryonic. However, my developing expertise in Latino visual art has been used in a gallery talk and YouTube interview for Nottingham Contemporary and in widening participation outreach events for secondary school students. It has also led me to develop a role on a steering committee with a local community art gallery in order to promote a local learning partnership tied to creativity in education.

The process of recovering and identifying neglected artworks for the book has also helped me to establish new connections between private collectors and galleries and family members of the artists under discussion in the monograph. My research on the photographer John Candelario in particular has also been used by curators and historians to help prepare material for the travelling exhibition Mabel Dodge Luhan &amp;amp; Company: American Moderns and the West, organised by the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, in 2016, and due to show in galleries in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Buffalo, New York, with an accompanying publication. The exhibition supports one of the main contentions of my book, A Contested Art, which shows that modernism in the Southwest was shaped by patterns of exchange between Hispano and Anglo-American artistic traditions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>803B4755-9F63-499C-9297-DF2E68AE7711</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5452af53920fc2.04085105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has brought to light the intercultural world of modernism in New Mexico and the central role that Spanish-speaking Hispano artists played in shaping different varieties of modernism during the first half of the twentieth century. Hispano modernisms generated competing visions of art, place and identity which reflected upon and sometimes critiqued the dominant systems of art patronage and myth-making in New Mexico. Hispano artists challenged the modernist primitivist narrative that New Mexico was an isolated land of enchantment built on tri-cultural harmony and ethnic purity. Some Hispanos established affinities with local Native cultures in their art and working lives; others with non-local places and cultural sources that were tied to the Spanish-speaking Southwest, Mexico, and Latin America. The project has therefore enabled me to identify new lines of modernist and mestizo innovation in Hispano art whilst recovering neglected artists and artworks. It has also led me to research in depth for the first time the important role of female Hispana artists who had to negotiate both ethnic and gender-role expectations in their attempts to gain artistic recognition.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By demonstrating Hispano artists' ties to the Spanish-speaking Southwest, Mexico and Latin America, I hope that scholars will begin to place the study of Hispano art, and Hispano New Mexico more broadly, within the more radically-informed fields of Chicano and Latino Studies. Given that the book is in some ways a recovery project involving the identification of lost or neglected artworks, I hope the research will also be used to inform curators and exhibition consultants about the need for the broader public display of Hispano art in galleries and museums. For example, my research on John Candelario has recently helped inform exhibition materials for the forthcoming travelling show Mabel Dodge Luhan &amp;amp; Company: American Moderns and the West, which will travel in New Mexico and New York state from 2016 with the aim of showing the various artistic traditions that shaped modernism in the region. My search for neglected artworks has also helped to forge links between private collectors, galleries, and the families of the artists under discussion in the book. There are also possibilities for developing an online resource in collaboration with family members of artists who have been neglected outside of New Mexico.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>526DD44B-5B19-44ED-B67B-985FD897DB0C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5452bed3061272.15916425</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7AE5F917-7133-4185-B739-A1A9C23835DB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reworking the Spanish Colonial Paradigm: Mestizaje and Spirituality in Contemporary New Mexican Art</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of American Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/298213b107728ebc744c173a8c4d568a"><gtr:id>298213b107728ebc744c173a8c4d568a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LEWTHWAITE S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d011011b112595</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7C9F367-ACF6-474A-AC62-7E9D0B7ADBBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Routledge Companion to Latina/o Popular Culture</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09d7b3428a7ab614e7b9ab69c67195ad"><gtr:id>09d7b3428a7ab614e7b9ab69c67195ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lewthwaite, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d4684ac19195.29008846</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5766A806-3022-4C51-92B5-A794297F16F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>?
