Systematic reviews of the evidence</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0500432</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The treatment of gynaecological cancers at present largely revolves around radical surgery which, although potentially successful has many associated complications. There are many studies into the use of imaging and keyhole surgery to diagnose the spread and to treat such cancers. These methods would hopefully reduce the complication experienced by patients, but their success rates are still debated. All the studies published on this topic will be collected. They will be assessed to see how accurately they have been performed and the results combined to show an overall estimate of the accuracy of diagnosing the spread of gynaecological cancers to the lymph nodes without the use of radical surgery and the success of using keyhole surgery in the treatment of such cancers. The results of these reviews will then be combined to develop analytical models where decisions are based on trade-off between expected benefits and harms. This should lead to production of informed and integrated clinical care pathways so that women can be treated in the best way possible with a minimum of associated complications</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Scientific Objectives: 1. Evaluate the accuracy of non-invasive imaging and minimally invasive procedures) for the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in vulval, cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers. 2. Evaluate the use and effectiveness of minimal access surgical procedures in the treatment of lymphadenopathy in cervical cancer and in macroscopic surgical clearance for cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancer. 3. Integrate diagnostic and therapeutic information using decision-analytic modelling.
Collaborations: There will be close collaboration with the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (Professor R. Gray), the Public Health and Epidemiology Department (Dr R. Taylor) and the Health Economics Facility (Professor S. Bryan). These units will provide direct access to expertise, supervision and guidance in data analysis, economic evaluation and the various other components of my comprehensive training program.
Methodology: The guidance on systematic reviews published by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, the University of York will be followed. There will be reviews in two areas, diagnosis and treatment. The following recommended steps will be used: framing the questions for reviews; identifying relevant literature; assessing the quality of the literature; summarising the evidence; interpreting the evidence by decision-analytical modelling. Systematic literature searches will identify potentially relevant citations and the full manuscripts will be obtained. Final inclusion/exclusion will be decided after examination of these. Appropriate data extraction forms will be developed for diagnostic and therapeutic reviews. The quality of this literature will then be assessed and the evidence summaries produced using the published guidance e.g. STARD, QUADAS, MOOSE, and the Cochrane hand book which facilitate the appraisal of the study design. The diagnostic data will be analysed computing sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate) and likelihood ratios (LR) for individual studies. All analysis will be reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The relationship between sensitivity and specificity will be explored as part of the assessment for heterogeneity between studies using a graphical approach, (a plot of sensitivity and specificity in the receiver operating characteristics, ROC space). In addition, statistical tests will be used to check if the differences between studies are due to play of chance and if there is a correlation between sensitivity and specificity. Meta-DiSc software will be used for the statistical analysis. The therapeutic data will be evaluated using relative risks (RR), their 95% CIs, and Forest plots using Review Manager Software. When feasible meta-analysis will be undertaken. We will employ a random or fixed effects model appropriately. Funnel plots will be used to examine publication bias. The diagnostic and therapeutic information generated from systematic reviews will be integrate using decision-analytic modelling to develop an evidence based approach to the detection and treatment of lymphadenopathy in gynaecological cancers.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0500432</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>046212FE-8853-46F0-B1E7-3CBA4770A15F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.4  Surgery</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
