DNA itself is generally organised in highly compacted structures, in particular supercoils in which the helical axis of DNA is coiled about itself. Supercoiling has a dramatic effect on the expression of genes and has been shown to act as a global regulator of gene expression. Our understanding of how supercoiling influences the behaviour of DNA is far from complete, particularly at the molecular level. Therefore we have developed a model system involving small DNA circles that we can analyse both by experimental methods and computer modelling. By combining these experimental and theoretical approaches we aim to understand how DNA recognition is affected by supercoiling, and how we can use supercoiling to influence biological processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The strength and specificity of many DNA-protein interactions is sensitive to DNA supercoiling, to the extent that E. coli has been shown to re-programme its transcriptome by modulating the superhelical state of its genome. However, we still have little understanding of how such control mechanisms operate. Despite the numerous DNA and protein-DNA structures available in the Protein Database, which have shown the importance of DNA structure and flexibility in DNA recognition, there is almost no structural information on supercoiled DNA because this is more difficult to study using traditional methods such as crystallography or NMR. We will develop tools that allow supercoiling-dependent DNA recognition to be studied in a highly controllable way. We will then use these tools to understand the physical principles that underlie supercoiling-dependent DNA recognition, so that it becomes possible to predict supercoiling-dependency in genome-level studies. The methodology uses specially designed small DNA circles whose structure and superhelical state is both predictable and controllable. Physical insight will come from integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We will employ three tractable systems to test our methodology: 1) DNA minicircles - these have controllable sequences and levels of supercoiling, and are sufficiently small to be amenable to atomistic simulation. 2) DNA triplexes - we aim to measure how DNA triplex formation is affected by supercoiling the DNA circle and to use triplexes as agents to probe and perturb DNA structure. 3) Phage 434 repressor - this is a paradigm example of a genetic switch that is sensitive to changes in DNA supercoiling and topology, which we will use as a model system of DNA-protein interaction to study supercoiling-dependent recognition.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? 1.

Supercoiling also influences the way in which DNA interacts with other molecules, and therefore is implicated in genetic control. We have used a combination of experiment and simulation to understand how the binding of a third DNA strand into tiny DNA minicircles is affected by supercoiling. We have found that both the supercoiling and the small size of the circles is extremely important in modulating the binding of the external molecule to the DNA, and have been able to explain why this happens using computer modelling to inspect the various thermodynamic changes that take place when the third strand binds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our combination of simulations and experiment provide valuable new insight into the structure and thermodynamics of supercoiled DNA at the atomistic level. They provide new tools for the investigation of DNA topology based genetic control, and offer striking new insight into the possible role of DNA supercoiling in long range protein-DNA interactions, which we anticipate will be investigated in the future by other groups. The simulations also show the nature of the structural defects that occur in DNA due to supercoiling, which will inspire other theoretical studies at multiple length-scales.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>744A0E24-7FDF-4090-921A-820ADB645BBA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461da363197c7.20738644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6AD3A5D8-0114-420D-8EF8-06B31205EFD9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Small DNA circles as probes of DNA topology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57e6cf676e39e7458a74016bc3166541"><gtr:id>57e6cf676e39e7458a74016bc3166541</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bates AD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5461db67b655d5.02353351</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A3F414FD-2B7E-47CF-9B8E-14EC93848855</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/33d893778ad48afa1dd71758eb5628ea"><gtr:id>33d893778ad48afa1dd71758eb5628ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Irobalieva RN</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2041-1723</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd50bec4d371.64447682</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F53D100-ACD2-4B3C-A9AD-489CEB57F65E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interference between Triplex and Protein Binding to Distal Sites on Supercoiled DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0"><gtr:id>f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Noy A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3495</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c140ddb67327.56352448</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>37178CE4-5166-4EF9-8692-2CD3D92817D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein/DNA interactions in complex DNA topologies: expect the unexpected.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0"><gtr:id>f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Noy A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1867-2450</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d33da9f49b3.29819848</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB611A92-20C1-48E7-9081-EE26226BBF78</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein/DNA interactions in complex DNA topologies: expect the unexpected.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0"><gtr:id>f8cf757b7a12eef927244c26007a50b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Noy A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1867-2450</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d33dfdfd772.25197719</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77B5F542-8889-47E5-B3DE-C571D55CAD8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparison of molecular contours for measuring writhe in atomistic supercoiled DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of chemical theory and computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f67852576d39c4c394892588bf8513f0"><gtr:id>f67852576d39c4c394892588bf8513f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sutthibutpong T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1549-9618</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd50be65ba28.67273301</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I019472/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
