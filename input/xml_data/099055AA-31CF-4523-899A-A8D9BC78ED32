heating, hot water and power supply. The universities have specific knowledge of the most advanced PV/T and loop heat pipe technologies and also expertise in China-oriented business strategy. The companies have strong R&amp;amp;D and
manufacturing capacity in solar PV, thermal, PV/T and heat storage/exchangers. The new PV/T system will achieve around 30% higher overall solar efficiency and 20% cost saving compared to the existing equivalent PV/T systems and will be flexible in component selection to meet different needs in buildings. The innovative technologies include (1) a novel loop-heat-pipe (LHP); (2) a novel PV/T panel; (3) a highly efficient heat storage/exchanger, and (4) an internet-based intelligent monitoring and control system. In terms of tasks, the project involves development of (1) a computerised design and optimisation model; (2) an experimental prototype and associated test rig; (3) a pre-production solar PV/T system for real building use; and (4) the economic, environmental and market performance reports and business model specifically tailored for the PV/T system.

University of Hull (UHULL), as the Coordinator of the project and lead partner of the UK team, will be responsible for management of all project activities, play a key role in development of the experimental prototype PV/T system and
associated computer simulation models, assist in economic and environmental analyses and other project tasks. From technical point of view, UHULL has the established expertise in PV/micro-channel-thermal panels and loop heat pipe
(LHP). During the project progress, UHULL will bring together the two successful innovations to develop a next-generation, high efficiency and low cost PV/T panels and associated passive, zero-power heat flow transportation system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed UK-China collaborative project aims to develop a novel high efficiency, low cost, building integrate-able solar PV/T system for space heating, hot water and power supply, which has the potential to open up an enormous commercial market in China and worldwide. Realisation of the project aim will bring about a number of ODA related benefits: (1) accelerating the economic development and welfare growth of China and the UK by probating two prospective businesses; (2) promoting China's sustainable development and mitigating its environmental pollution by reducing the fossil fuel consumption and carbon/dust emissions and increasing the use of renewable solar energy in buildings; and (3) helping reduce poverty in China and enhance the living standard and health condition of Chinese people.

Furthermore, the project will directly benefit the project partners, relevant material/components suppliers and system installers, in terms of the PV/T products sale/installation, and knowledge/technology transfer on a global scale. It will also benefit China and UK industries in terms of the enhanced competitiveness, increased sale, and improved employment opportunities. In particular, the project will benefit the UK and China academic partners and personnel by (1) developing the new and lasting research collaborations, and enabling the knowledge transfer/share among them; (2) improving their research and innovation potentials; (3) promoting transfer of technologies among the academic organisations and between academic organisations and industries; and (4) enhancing the potential and future career perspectives of the participating academia, particularly of those new researchers.

The innovations developed by UHULL will form the foundation for commercialisation of the PV/T system, thus contributing to acceleration of the economic development and welfare growth of China, reduction of the carbon &amp;amp; dust emissions and mitigation of the poverty condition of Chinese people. From this point of view, UHULL's works will directly contribute to the purposes of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>387415</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R004684/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>97AD4D1C-4499-4C7E-AF8A-FE9EFE56E306</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
