Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M003922/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>What Works Scotland will be a collaborative centre bringing together staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, other academics and key non-academic partners. Its aim is to support the use of evidence to plan and deliver sustained and transformative change based on agreed outcomes at all levels with a particular focus on the local. There is a particular focus on promoting the systematic use of evidence in the design, reform and delivery of public services. 
Examination of what works and what does not will take place in the context of the Scottish model, an approach to policy development that, while not unique, differs considerably from elsewhere in the UK. The team has adopted a demand led and collaborative approach and will work with a range of third sector organisations, different levels of central and local government and with Community Planning Partnerships to generate an evidence culture involving feedback, improvement methodology and expert support. 
The Christie Commission identified a range of problems facing Scotland including demographic change, economic and fiscal challenges, inter-institutional relationships and endemic long-term 'wicked issues'. It has also been estimated that in Scotland over 40 per cent of public service expenditure is the result of preventable issues. The Scottish model of public service delivery aims to ensure that services are designed for and with communities. 
This 'deliberative public policy analysis' demands that communities and those who design services are aware of best practice and evidence. The Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) are key to the delivery of these services with a focus on 'voice' through participatory, collective, decision-making, planning and delivery in the context of targets set by National Government. A key challenge for each CPP is to articulate its Single Outcome Agreement and relate this to both the outcomes set out in the National Performance Framework. However, a common criticism of the CPPs is that the implementation of the model so far has been limited and patchy.
The focus of WWS will on the four key questions identified in the call:
- How can we take what we know from individual projects and interventions and translate this into system-wide change?
- What is working (or not working), and why, at the different levels of delivery and reform and at the interface between those levels? How do we identify actions which can be taken in communities, at CPP and the national levels to improve impact?
- What does the evidence (including international) say about large-scale reform programmes that have succeeded or failed and the impact they had in a system-wide context?
- Why do results vary geographically and between communities, and how can we balance local approaches with ensuring spread of what works?
A wide range of methods - qualitative and qualitative - will be employed. The capabilities approach will provide the overarching framework. Originally developed by Amartya Sen, capabilities are in widespread use across the globe and underpin the work of a variety of organisations. It is a useful corrective to top down economic evaluations and fits well with the Scottish deliberative approach. We will develop the Capabilities framework and combine it with the outcomes-based National Performance Framework, ensuring that the Scottish model is intellectually grounded and contributes to broader international debates on these matters.
We will have 3 workstreams: evidence into action; outcomes and capabilities; and spread, sustainability and scaling up. We will employ a range of methodologies including case studies collaborative action research, contribution analysis, elite interviews and content analysis, cost effectiveness and evaluation. WWS will focus on four case studies of key CPPS and work with them to help them change their core business processes within priority areas in four CPPs and will aim to achieve lasting impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The What Works Scotland proposal has impact built into the way it will operate throughout and our aim is to make the What Works Approach an essential part of policy-making and delivery in Scotland with lessons for policy-makers and those engaged in delivering services beyond Scotland. The proposed approach builds on local collaborative learning to develop an understanding of what works. It will then create channels for wider sharing and sustainability allowing us to achieve lasting impact. The WWS draws on our own extensive experience of knowledge exchange and knowledge to action. In particular it builds on effective knowledge exchange processes developed through running research centres such as the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships which has built up expertise in creating and assessing impact over 12 years. By growing and improving the evidence base on effective policy interventions and working with a range of organisation designing and delivering public services in Scotland to promote the use of evidence in practice, the outputs of WWS will impact directly on a range of different groups of people including: 
1. Community Planning Partnerships and the National Community Planning Group.
2. Other public sector, third sector and other organisations and businesses charged with designing and delivering effective and efficient services in Scotland.
3. Elected representatives including community councillors, local authority councillors, Members of the Scottish Parliament, and Members of Parliament.
4. Professional associations and bodies engaged in policy making and delivery, including the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the various professional networks involved in CPPs.
5. Members of local communities with an interest in specific WWS topics.
Through their engagement with WWS case study areas will:
* Have a clearer understanding of their local area, local needs, what is and isn't working
* Have mechanisms in place for utilising the best evidence to inform planning and service delivery
* Have increased capacity to generate, use and interpret evidence, including increased evaluation capacity.
* Have a better understanding of the barriers and enablers of delivering effective services to meet local needs.

Wider stakeholders will:
* Have access to mechanisms for utilising the best evidence to inform planning and service delivery to enable better services
* Learn about what does and doesn't work in different context in Scotland and internationally, and be able to draw on successful models and processes to improve the delivery of services
* Understand what is required to deliver effective services from the learning and sharing from WWS

At the end of three years WWS will have embedded:
* New innovative ways of planning and delivering services, some of which will have been picked up by our sustainability partners
* An Evidence Bank, that will be maintained beyond the initial project
* A Knowledge broker network that will sustain knowledge to action capacity in the system
* Networks between localities for learning and sharing that will help sustain new approaches that have been developed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3470629</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Evaluation Support Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Evidence to Action Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DF12968-F6B8-4E54-A90D-370208823CE0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mapping excecise of knowledge services in Scotland

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs. 
Some Community of Practice relationships were generated across the four CPPs (for example between Fife and Glasgow on Participatory Budgeting, which later fed into a joint visit to Paris to explore PB).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b986170badc1.12463537-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In advance of the event partners from Glasgow, Fife, West Dunbartonshire and Aberdeenshire prepared presentations on their collaborative action research projects which they were doing with WWS. At the event they each presented four times to other participants. All participants were given time away from work to attend the event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>WWS invited 21 selected participants who were active and key to the progress of the WWS Collaborative Action Research work in the four partner sites. Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Government</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Enabling Collaborative Leadership Pioneer Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>CABAC51D-E5F1-4B10-B1AB-68FFBF62E664</gtr:id><gtr:impact>WWS report on first phase of research to be published very soon</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e171b7f1c5c6.80737009-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have designed and are delivering the programme.

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs.

Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeenshire Health and Social Care Partnership</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Aberdeenshire: Beyond Action Learning - a collaborative inquiry into skills that support collaborative approaches</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDFFF069-A40D-4A57-85D4-B9281B6F491C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Learning Report

This included agreement on community council boundaries as the relevant local geography, agreeing a rational for aligning data and local geographies, and piloting an interactive tool and dash board for presentation of the profiles data on the West Dunbartonshire Community Planning website. The lead officer for West Dunbartonshire has written a project workplan, taken part in training on the use of the Tableau dashboard and held meetings with local partners to promote the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>West Dunbartonshire is one of four national case sites where WWS are researching public service reform in community planning through a process of collaborative action research. The purpose of this project is to work with the community planning team in West Dunbartonshire to co-produce community profiles that can be used to improve the performance of public services, increase levels of local knowledge on the needs and assets of localities, and stimulate dialogue with local people on priorities for local action plans. The aim is to make statistical data at the micro-level more accessible, relevant and meaningful; and to contribute to a more informed approach to local decision-making both by communities and the CPP. 

At a local level the background to this project was the commitment from the West Dunbartonshire CPP to developing a new neighbourhood approach to service design and delivery (see the Community Planning West Dunbartonshire SOA 2014 - 17). This neighbourhood approach, currently being rolled out throughout West Dunbartonshire, is known locally as 'Your Community'. It involves a process of 'community profiling', which includes gathering and sharing local data. During preliminary discussions on the focus of the support from WWS, community planning officers identified community profiling as a priority area for collaboration. 

Community planning officers identified three areas where they required external support to produce the data indicators for each of the 17 communities defined in their locality planning model: First, specialist skills and technology in mapping and data analysis were needed to address the problem of finding comparable data at the local geographical scale and within the boundaries identified for locality planning. Second, in addition to production of a set of profiles, a key priority was to develop the skills and capacity of local officers to undertake the production of neighbourhood profiles for themselves. Third, the intention was for the CPP to use neighbourhood profiles as a tool to stimulate dialogue with local people on the needs and priorities for their area. Officers were concerned that the needs-led rather than asset-led nature of deprivation statistics could be a potential barrier to engaging with communities. 

On behalf of WWS, I led on the negotiation and facilitated the collaboration between the project partners. The outcome was an agreement to deliver a project to develop the analytical and GIS mapping skills and capacity of local staff and increase potential for a sustainable in-house approach to data profiling; produce 18 sets of indicators (profiles) for West Dunbartonshire; develop web-based access to profiles and interactive mapping; and improve the coordination and sharing of data within the community planning partnership.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Robert Owen Centre for Educational Change</gtr:department><gtr:description>Public Service Leadership</gtr:description><gtr:id>FB43ECFA-C26E-4392-914E-83FD4221BBAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organisation of Public Leadership Seminar planned for spring 2016

HLH has adapted the Otago programme in pragmatic ways to suit local settings and resources (for example the group exercises take place in community settings rather than participants' homes).HLH would like to explore whether there is a financial or other case for rolling out the Otago Exercise Programme model to other older people's care providers in NHS Highland.
We are supporting the coordination of this project, linking between the organisations, editing outputs, and writing the case study
Aims 
? To support High Life Highland to develop an evidence base to inform decision making about the future implementation of the Otago exercise programme. 
? To capture evidence from this process to inform future evidence to action projects. 

Research questions
1. How is the Otago exercise programme currently being implemented in Highland? To what extent is current implementation supported by the evidence base?
2. How is the intervention anticipated to contribute to improve outcomes for participants and NHS Highland? 
3. What needs to be in place for these benefits to be realised and what are the main risks?
4. To what extent does the intervention contribute to improved outcomes for participants and NHS Highland?
5. What are the implications of the findings for future implementation of the Otago exercise programme and the work of Highlife highland and NHS Highland to reduce falls and promote the health and wellbeing of older people?
6. What is the learning from this process for other organisations seeking to spread and scale up evidence based interventions and to get evidence into action?
Process
The project will be carried out in collaboration between Highlife Highland and NHS Highland, What Works Scotland and the University of Highland and Islands and will involve four phases of work. 

Phase 1. Project set up and critical appraisal of current implementation. 
Phase 2. Developing the theory of change and evaluation framework
Phase 3. Data gathering and preliminary analysis
Phase 4. Analysis to decisions


 Case study development: learning will be captured in a case study, focussing on wider lessons of adapting evidence-based programmes for local use.

This project is currently in Phase 3 and will be completed by the end of April, with wider sharing of lessons continuing until the end of June 2017</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oxfam GB</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Challenge Poverty Week: On-line collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>71560A3E-49FF-4063-B4DC-A8C1ADA3F1FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25 blog contributions covering various aspects of poverty.

They each influenced the priorities for the agenda for the visit. They both provided gifts to Paris. They both wrote blogs specifying their learning from the visit and all participants interviewed for the visit video. With WWS encouragement, they each met with Mr Ari Brodach, PB lead for Paris, when he visited Scotland in February 2017 to sustain their European relationship. Since the visit Glasgow and Fife have been in close contact about their next PB steps, the visit stimulating a new cross-CPP policy and practice learning relationship on PB in Scotland. The international learning and relationships developed in the 2-day visit are therefore being sustained.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In December 2016, WWS coordinated a 2-day fact-finding visit on Participatory Budgeting for three public services officers and a councillor from Glasgow and three public service workers from Fife. Glasgow were already involved with Collaborative Action Research with WWS to devise a PB Evaluation Toolkit; and both Fife and Glasgow were at contemplation stage on mainstreaming PB. For two days, the workers visited Paris, Europe's leading city for mainstreaming PB, and met with the Paris PB Steering group, the PB lead officer for Paris, and PB practitioners in Paris. WWS liaised for 5 months with Paris officers to organise the visit (dates, protocols on social media usage, engaging an interpreter), and WWS collaborated with the officers from Fife and Glasgow to decide priorities for the visit.

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs. 
Some Community of Practice relationships were generated across the four CPPs (for example between Fife and Glasgow on Participatory Budgeting, which later fed into a joint visit to Paris to explore PB).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b986170badc1.12463537-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In advance of the event partners from Glasgow, Fife, West Dunbartonshire and Aberdeenshire prepared presentations on their collaborative action research projects which they were doing with WWS. At the event they each presented four times to other participants. All participants were given time away from work to attend the event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>WWS invited 21 selected participants who were active and key to the progress of the WWS Collaborative Action Research work in the four partner sites. Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeenshire Health and Social Care Partnership</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Aberdeenshire Health and Social Care Partnership: Scoping a Stragic Approach to Community Capacity-Building</gtr:description><gtr:id>670EAEE5-A1C5-4094-BF2C-BCEA00298932</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion Group on Community Capacity-Building across CPP (Nov 2016) - Aberdeenshire HSCP; Aberdeenshire Alcohol and Drugs Partnership; Aberdeenshire Voluntary Action; Aberdeenshire Rural Partnerships; Aberdeenshire Council; Friends of Insch Hospital and Community

Glasgow were already involved with Collaborative Action Research with WWS to devise a PB Evaluation Toolkit; and both Fife and Glasgow were at contemplation stage on mainstreaming PB. For two days, the workers visited Paris, Europe's leading city for mainstreaming PB, and met with the Paris PB Steering group, the PB lead officer for Paris, and PB practitioners in Paris. WWS liaised for 5 months with Paris officers to organise the visit (dates, protocols on social media usage, engaging an interpreter), and WWS collaborated with the officers from Fife and Glasgow to decide priorities for the visit.

HLH has adapted the Otago programme in pragmatic ways to suit local settings and resources (for example the group exercises take place in community settings rather than participants' homes).HLH would like to explore whether there is a financial or other case for rolling out the Otago Exercise Programme model to other older people's care providers in NHS Highland.
We are supporting the coordination of this project, linking between the organisations, editing outputs, and writing the case study
Aims 
? To support High Life Highland to develop an evidence base to inform decision making about the future implementation of the Otago exercise programme. 
? To capture evidence from this process to inform future evidence to action projects. 

Research questions
1. How is the Otago exercise programme currently being implemented in Highland? To what extent is current implementation supported by the evidence base?
2. How is the intervention anticipated to contribute to improve outcomes for participants and NHS Highland? 
3. What needs to be in place for these benefits to be realised and what are the main risks?
4. To what extent does the intervention contribute to improved outcomes for participants and NHS Highland?
5. What are the implications of the findings for future implementation of the Otago exercise programme and the work of Highlife highland and NHS Highland to reduce falls and promote the health and wellbeing of older people?
6. What is the learning from this process for other organisations seeking to spread and scale up evidence based interventions and to get evidence into action?
Process
The project will be carried out in collaboration between Highlife Highland and NHS Highland, What Works Scotland and the University of Highland and Islands and will involve four phases of work. 

Phase 1. Project set up and critical appraisal of current implementation. 
Phase 2. Developing the theory of change and evaluation framework
Phase 3. Data gathering and preliminary analysis
Phase 4. Analysis to decisions


 Case study development: learning will be captured in a case study, focussing on wider lessons of adapting evidence-based programmes for local use.

This project is currently in Phase 3 and will be completed by the end of April, with wider sharing of lessons continuing until the end of June 2017</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeenshire Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Challenge current practice and assumptions!

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs. 
Some Community of Practice relationships were generated across the four CPPs (for example between Fife and Glasgow on Participatory Budgeting, which later fed into a joint visit to Paris to explore PB).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b986170badc1.12463537-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In advance of the event partners from Glasgow, Fife, West Dunbartonshire and Aberdeenshire prepared presentations on their collaborative action research projects which they were doing with WWS. At the event they each presented four times to other participants. All participants were given time away from work to attend the event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>WWS invited 21 selected participants who were active and key to the progress of the WWS Collaborative Action Research work in the four partner sites. Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>Fife collaborative inquiry: Schools intervention group</gtr:description><gtr:id>262E6810-8129-465B-9FD1-0D8B0AED9410</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Creation of the research inquiry PIT leading to improvements in the delivery of schools intervention work in Kirkcaldy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0344bca4a38.05914731-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Facilities for meetings</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My contribution included:

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs. 
Some Community of Practice relationships were generated across the four CPPs (for example between Fife and Glasgow on Participatory Budgeting, which later fed into a joint visit to Paris to explore PB).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b986170badc1.12463537-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In advance of the event partners from Glasgow, Fife, West Dunbartonshire and Aberdeenshire prepared presentations on their collaborative action research projects which they were doing with WWS. At the event they each presented four times to other participants. All participants were given time away from work to attend the event.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>WWS invited 21 selected participants who were active and key to the progress of the WWS Collaborative Action Research work in the four partner sites. Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Administrative Data Research Centre for Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exploring the impact of cash grants on low income households</gtr:description><gtr:id>F20E887A-E7F4-409C-8F92-C1B2D4D1BE52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e17e4c871565.85187636-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Cash for Kids provided data and ADRC are working with WWS to undertake the exploratory data linkage and analysis</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We brought the parties together after initial work with cash for kids - as a three-way collaboration new are using data linkage to see whether there are impacts on grant recipient households via three measures related to education - e.g. attendance and performance.

After the event insights from Perth were shared by participants in CAR group meetings in all four partner CPPs, and with other local colleagues in at least three of the CPPs.

Twenty-one practitioners working for local authorities, housing associations, third sector organisations, and health services participated. Eight WWS staff from the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, plus two PhD students attached to WWS, were involved in organising, facilitating, presenting and recording the event. WWS informed participants in advance that the event was designed to achieve particular learning outcomes that were core to developing the CAR approach, supporting participants' local inquiry work, and achieving the wider WWS project objectives. The event sought to enable partners: To understand and influence national-level learning emerging from the WWS work with the four CPPs; To increase participants' understanding of the Collaborative Action Research/Collaborative Inquiry process being led by WWS; To identify facilitators and barriers to implementing changes in your CPP as a result of partners' local work with WWS; To learn about the local work being done with WWS by fellow practitioners working in the three other CPPs; Intensive training to enhance partners' skills in community engagement and partnership working. The event also sought for partners to understand and influence what WWS is starting to learn from our work with the partners. The event included training on facilitation skills (Oliver Escobar WWS); evaluation methods (Peter Craig WWS); and spread and scale (Nick Bland WWS) and knowledge that will enrich your community engagement and partnership working. The event lasted two days and consisted of a range of dynamic, innovative activities, some co-produced with the participants. All participants were briefed in advance that they would be expected to make an impact back in the CPPs by preparing in Perth to feed back their learning from the event and influence CAR group colleagues or strategic individuals in their CPP. The underpinning aim of the event was to encourage participants from across the CPPs to meet, talk and share learning, seeking to develop a fledgling Community of Practice amongst the participants ('groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly' (Wenger, 2006)). WWS conceptualised the event (led by Richard Brunner WWS), organised the venue and logistics (led by Lynda Fraser WWS), paid for the whole event, and facilitated the event - except where we had organised activities to be specifically led by partners, where instead we mentored them to do this. WWS (led by Richard Brunner with Hayley Bennett, James Henderson and Claire Bynner WWS) wrote an end-of-event report demonstrating the learning from the event in terms of CAR in practice; public service reform; fostering a community of practice and how practitioners work with evidence; and the outcomes of the evaluation of the event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Fife Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Communities and Corporate Development</gtr:department><gtr:description>Fife collaborative inquiry: Family support approaches</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A7B254A-09B1-477D-A9A0-83AD105F2CD7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>established a group of practitioners to explore 'whole family approaches'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e161917e1dc2.23975291-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>meeting rooms</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My contribution includes: intellectual input, research training, research resources, meeting facilitation, partnership capacity building</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeenshire Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Aberdeenshire Community Planning Partnership and What Works Scotland: 'Putting Christie into Action'</gtr:description><gtr:id>8892F6AE-BCF9-431C-ACCD-40EBEF78017D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Range of events as listed above.

The purpose of this project is to work with the community planning team in West Dunbartonshire to co-produce community profiles that can be used to improve the performance of public services, increase levels of local knowledge on the needs and assets of localities, and stimulate dialogue with local people on priorities for local action plans. The aim is to make statistical data at the micro-level more accessible, relevant and meaningful; and to contribute to a more informed approach to local decision-making both by communities and the CPP. 

At a local level the background to this project was the commitment from the West Dunbartonshire CPP to developing a new neighbourhood approach to service design and delivery (see the Community Planning West Dunbartonshire SOA 2014 - 17). This neighbourhood approach, currently being rolled out throughout West Dunbartonshire, is known locally as 'Your Community'. It involves a process of 'community profiling', which includes gathering and sharing local data. During preliminary discussions on the focus of the support from WWS, community planning officers identified community profiling as a priority area for collaboration. 

Community planning officers identified three areas where they required external support to produce the data indicators for each of the 17 communities defined in their locality planning model: First, specialist skills and technology in mapping and data analysis were needed to address the problem of finding comparable data at the local geographical scale and within the boundaries identified for locality planning. Second, in addition to production of a set of profiles, a key priority was to develop the skills and capacity of local officers to undertake the production of neighbourhood profiles for themselves. Third, the intention was for the CPP to use neighbourhood profiles as a tool to stimulate dialogue with local people on the needs and priorities for their area. Officers were concerned that the needs-led rather than asset-led nature of deprivation statistics could be a potential barrier to engaging with communities. 

On behalf of WWS, I led on the negotiation and facilitated the collaboration between the project partners. The outcome was an agreement to deliver a project to develop the analytical and GIS mapping skills and capacity of local staff and increase potential for a sustainable in-house approach to data profiling; produce 18 sets of indicators (profiles) for West Dunbartonshire; develop web-based access to profiles and interactive mapping; and improve the coordination and sharing of data within the community planning partnership.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>West Dunbartonshire Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Communities Partnership Innovation Team</gtr:description><gtr:id>166DB915-2144-4BD8-A0B4-0F4A5612D4FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have written an interim report on the findings on Community-led Action Planning and Collaborative Action Research.

This interim report has been discussed with the Corporate and Community Planning Manager and with the West Dunbartonshire Communities Team and has been the catalyst for the next phase of collaborative work. The focus of the work on this project this year will be to evaluate the pilot and phase one of the new local action planning model and to inform its future development. A summary version of the interim report on Community-led Action Planning is currently being co-written with a local officer for dissemination to community engagement practitioners in West Dunbartonshire and to national partners attending the WWS National Collaborative Learning Event on 23-24 February 2016.

I have been working with the team to facilitate, plan, mentor, guide and broker external support for their collaborative action research on 'What Works in Community-led Action Planning?' This project is part of a programme of work to develop a neighbourhood approach to community planning which includes developing a model of local action planning for 17 neighbourhoods in West Dunbartonshire. The contributions I have made to this collaboration includes providing training in action research and producing a learning pack for local officers in narrative interviewing; setting up contacts with peers in other CPPs who have developed new models of community-led action planning; sharing the latest updates on the Community Empowerment Act and redrafting of National Standards for Community Engagement; 

The most substantial contribution has been the facilitation, coordination and planning of a Community -led Action Planning Development Day with support from the Communities Team and WWS colleagues. Thirty participants attended the Community-led including employees of West Dunbartonshire Council, local voluntary sector including housing and youth organisations, the leisure company, the local Health and Social Care Partnership and Skills Development Scotland. The event included a session with Oliver Escobar on the Scottish Policy Context and the Community Empowerment Act, clips from video recordings of action research Interviews, a meta-planning activity to draw out key conditions to support community-led approaches and a co-design workshop where participants considered a real example of a community-led action planning process. This work has increased understanding and awareness of the Community Empowerment Act and local action planning among West Dunbartonshire Council staff and partners organisations. A wide range of participatory methods, creative ideas and techniques were shared at the collaborative event.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Fife Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Education and learning</gtr:department><gtr:description>Fife collaborative inquiry: Schools intervention group</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A890040-6062-48FD-AE7F-91880BF5222B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Creation of the research inquiry PIT leading to improvements in the delivery of schools intervention work in Kirkcaldy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0344bca4a38.05914731-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Facilities for meetings</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My contribution included:

With the recent rise in inequality, there has been a fracturing of societies in Europe and the United States. In the UK, there has been a worrying prominence given to the idea of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' groups of people. This has been a core theme behind the changes to the welfare system and, through the Brexit debate and threat of repeal of the Human Rights Act, appears to be becoming more central to political thinking. 
During this time in Scotland, charities and government alike have taken an increasingly internationalist position. This has included supporting the Sustainable Development goals, and pushing Scotland's participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP). The OGP is an international platform for domestic reformers committed to more open, accountable, and responsive government. 
Scotland has recently been awarded pioneer status and must deliver an action plan in partnership with Scottish civil society. This means the third sector is in a great position to champion its values of equality, inclusion and participation. Can open government provide an answer to rising inequality and polarising public attitudes? We will attempt to answer this, with a particular focus on Scotland and how to include those who feel ignored by decision makers.
Event aims
? To make those in the room aware of Scotland's special status within the global open government movement, and of why this matters to the third sector.
? To make those in the room aware of Sustainable Development Goals, and of why the open government movement is essential to the delivery of these. 
? To understand the context of societal change and what works in building dialogue and bridging divides between people and communities. 
? To initiate discussion about how we can use Scotland's special status to develop our use of technology, activism and scrutiny in building capacity of citizens to re-engage in their democracy.
? To provide an opportunity for the wider third sector to engage in the ongoing discussion on open government, and how this should look and feel in Scotland. 

Following the panel four people approached me for more information on my research and on What Works Scotland. Emily Beardsmore contacted me and asked if I would be a speaker for them in a series of talks at Milk - Milk is social enterprise cafe based in Govanhill, which provides a safe, supportive environment where ethnic minority women can receive work experience and english language classes, as well as taking part in various community integration projects.

This included:
- presentation of the international evidence review from What Works Scotland: 'Scaling up innovation', and how that evidence can inform planning for successful spread;
- the practical experience of using this evidence to plan for the city-wide scale-up of a multi-agency intervention with vulnerable families from a case study in Aberdeen;
- discussion of the implications of the findings and the impact of other settings and experiences.
- launch of tools created by What Works Scotland

Those taking part included: senior managers, decision-makers, and practitioners from organisations including Community Planning Partnerships, health and social care, local authorities, the third sector and civil servants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dee1be79fd60.59589321</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://spreading-what-works.eventbrite.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community-led Approaches to Reducing Poverty: A Review of Evidence and Practice - in relation to Clydebank and West of Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28092624-CE63-42A0-B350-4DDA1E0C9088</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was delivered in collaboration with West Dunbartonshire Council and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

There is increasing interest across the UK in supporting community-based activity to meet local needs. In Scotland, this focus on 'community-led approaches' is expressed in the Community Empowerment Act (2015).
The main focus was a presentation by Dr Richard Crisp, from the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, who spoke about the findings in his research report - Community-led approaches to reducing poverty in neighbourhoods: A review of evidence and practice - which was carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. This is the first comprehensive review of community-led activities and how these impact on poverty.

The attendees had opportunities to: learn about the evidence review and discuss the findings first-hand with the lead author, Dr Richard Crisp
contribute to discussions on how community-led activities could be a mechanism to mitigate and reduce poverty; discuss approaches to addressing poverty with fellow experts and a panel of researchers and policymakers; find inspiration and evidence for their strategies and approaches.

The event also included an overview of the Community Profiling project undertaken in West Dunbartonshire by What Works Scotland and the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, which developed area based data sets for each neighbourhood in West Dunbartonshire as a resource which can be used by policy makers and service providers to help in prioritising service delivery requirements.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5894810f615067.28902049</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/events/community-led-approaches-to-reducing-poverty-a-review-of-evidence-and-practice-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community-led approaches to reducing poverty (Dundee)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7284C92F-C1F7-4992-A451-D91D07D515CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 23rd Sept 2016 I co-organised and chaired an event in Dundee exploring community-led approaches to tackling poverty.

The Welsh Government's Partnerships and Transformation Division, together with Government Social Researchers, have been offering support direct to PSBs around well-being Assessment over the last two years. The regional workshops were the latest offer of support to PSBs. The starting point for inviting WWS for a plenary slot was the fact that Scotland has begun developing a model of joint working between academia and public services, which is of great interest in Wales. The topics/questions where PSBs particularly valued an external perspective:
o How Scotland has/will continue to build the relationships between academia and public services;
o The benefits this has brought for both public services and the academic community;
o What sorts of topic areas does WWS work on and how are these selected?
o Has there been a discernible impact on the way public services use evidence and for what purposes?
o Has the work of WWS prompted any discernible shifts in thinking or approaches to service delivery in Scotland?
o What impact has the collaboration had/beginning to have on analytical capacity in Scottish public services?
o Particular case studies/examples which demonstrate how it has worked and what it has produced. 
o The use of contribution analysis and its merit in designing and assessing collaborative action.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c4012a97cef8.57641697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Experiences in Participatory Budgeting: A Session with Giovanni Allegretti</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E37E628E-0EC9-4E7A-81C2-E3DD4D71C5D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar, hosted by Oliver Escobar from What Works Scotland, was an opportunity to hear about international participatory budgeting experiences and the comparisons with current developments in Scotland.

The research set out to explore: how young people end contact (successfully or not) with services; their experiences and views of the 'transition to adulthood'; and also what triggered, helped and hindered those who were trying to desist from offending. They were all acutely aware of their precarious situation and in many ways had accepted or blamed themselves for their unequal position. In many ways, for them social justice simply does not exist. Briege Nugent called for renewed hope so that inaction and continued poverty and inequality are not rendered inevitable.

Her presentation was followed by reflections from Karen McCulloch from Includem, and open discussion on key issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589483373ab0a9.02861278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/events/locked-out-locked-in-young-people-adulthood-and-desistance-from-crime/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Aberdeenshire Community Planning Partnership and What Works Scotland Collaborative Learning Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B53DB3D1-64D0-40CD-849D-DD7D0DA7DED5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approx. 40 people from the public sector, third/community sectors and WWS participated in a collaborative learning day - focused on developing local policy and practice in relation to the implementation of public service reform, through discussion, presentations etc.

This important book is a response to crises of public policy. Offering an original contribution to a growing debate, the authors argue that traditional technocratic ways of designing policy are inadequate to cope with increasingly complex challenges, and suggest co-production as a more democratic alternative.

Author Dr Catherine Durose is one of the most innovative thinkers and practitioners working on public policy and co-production in the UK. She is Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Local Government Studies, and Director of Research and Knowledge Transfer, School of Government and Society University of Birmingham. Two 'keynote readers' from the public and third sectors gave their reflections on the book at the event. They were:

There is increasing interest across the UK in supporting community-based activity to meet local needs. In Scotland, this focus on 'community-led approaches' is expressed in the Community Empowerment Act (2015). The main focus for this event was a presentation by Dr Richard Crisp, from the Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University, who spoke about the findings in his research report - Community-led approaches to reducing poverty in neighbourhoods: A review of evidence and practice - which was carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. This is the first comprehensive review of community-led activities and how these impact on poverty. The event in Dundee also included presentations on issues relevant to Dundee and the North East of Scotland in particular: Councillor Jimmy Black, Dundee Council, A Fair Way to Go: Report of the Dundee Fairness Commission; and Professor John McKendrick, Glasgow Caledonian University, Poverty in Scotland: Local opportunities for anti-poverty action in troubled and uncertain times?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589482218bbdd1.09306171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/events/community-led-approaches-to-reducing-poverty-a-review-of-evidence-and-practice-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Innovation and Equity:  Working Together for Educational Change</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C7EBCE9-6BAC-4049-85AF-532A4B8BB404</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by Professor Penny Wohlstetter,

Partners from each case study area presented on key aspects of their research projects, and the WWS Research Team members also presented on common themes and the potential for shared learnings emerging from the first year of this project. There were also several opportunities for networking, reflective learning and future planning throughout both days.

Delegates highly valued to the opportunity to have space for reflective learning, and that they benefitted from hearing about the experiences from other case study areas. Participants strongly expressed appreciation of the value gained by being able to connect with practitioners from other case study areas in this environment away from the daily working environment and to have space to learn.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56decb3480ec63.45582000</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>Pre-2006,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW) Expert Workshop on the future of public services</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E042596F-0F10-4D75-8E81-25CC2868335A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PPIW workshop which brought together some of the UK's leading public management experts with Welsh Government officials to discuss the challenges facing public services, existing evidence about the most effective ways of addressing these challenges and the most important gaps in the evidence base.
? The experts concluded that the challenges confronting public services in Wales cannot be addressed without significant reform. 
? They agreed that there is no universal theory of public service improvement which can be applied to all services and in all contexts. However, there is a wealth of practical knowledge about what works. 

My key contribution from the learning at WWs was to emphasize the importance of Context. A one size fits all approach will not work even in a relatively small country like Wales.Programmes need to be adapted so that they meet the needs of different communities and different groups of service users.

This was the start of a process on learning and developing community-led approaches. There will be further awareness raising and updates due to evolving policy and legislation around the Community Empowerment Act 2015.

Key Findings from the discussions during the day:
? The developing model will be an assets-based approach that aims to respond to community activity and aspirations and support community activism
? Five key factors were felt to be key to success: values and attitudes, resources, methods and skills, planning mechanisms, communication - 
? There is some further information needed to develop action plans: more information on the priorities and needs of neighbourhoods, identifying community assets and anchors, local neighbourhood data, learning from success and failures of community engagement activities in the past, and learning from other areas.
? The process needs to be: inclusive, promote culture change to be more responsive to local people, link to existing groups as well as develop new partnerships, promote communication and provide clear evidence and objectives for action planning.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0660902d014.62238400</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation (Aberdeen City Community Planning Partnership)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>198A1224-7EFF-4E95-AAF3-DD69D9E4E368</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Delivered a presentation on the results of a What Works Evidence Review on spreading 'what works'. The presentation was to about 20 members of Aberdeen City Community Planning Parntnership which comprises local politicians and leaders of local government and local public services.

As a result of this presentation, we were asked to design a framework to help practitioners in planning and implementing spread. The Community Planning Partnership Board has mandated the use of the WWS framework for all proposals to spread public service interventions or initiatives across the city, and will now only sanction spread activity based on the framework. Four projects to-date have come forward to the CPP Board applying the WWS spread framework. 

The first project to use the spread framework in Aberdeen City is seeking to spread a multi-agency approach to improving outcomes for vulnerable families across all parts of the city - the 'Priority Families project'.

Key highlights from the various work streams identified in our work plan include:
1. Collaborative Action Research
Our first year's work has focused on establishing and developing work with our core partners in the CPP case studies. In each CPP we have carried out a range of activities including facilitating and convening meetings, providing evidence and data analysis, training and carrying out evidence reviews. Key projects in each CPP include: 
Aberdeenshire - Rurality and its interface with Christie, communication and partnership working, health and social care integration and community capacity building. 
Fife - Developing joint working to tackle deprivation, poverty and inequality and the development of new, local initiatives including establishing a family hub, welfare reform and developing an early intervention project for teenagers in education.
Glasgow - In-work poverty and Thriving Places, an area-based approach to improving social justice outcomes. Other work includes an evaluation programme, participatory budgeting, sanctions, breakfast clubs, school holidays for low income families and co-production. 
West Dunbartonshire - Neighbourhood Management and tackling children's inequalities and in-work poverty, through the development of responsive and asset-based services and approaches and the co-production of neighbourhood profiles.
Our interventions in the CPPs are already having impact and changing the way the CPPs are working and there are a number of cross cutting themes emerging, including implementing and operationalising The Christie Commission recomendations; partnership working; workforce, leadership and culture change and methodological issues. These themes will be further explored in the year ahead.
2. Evidence to Action (E2A)
An E2A working group has been established bringing together interested parties from the NHS (NESS, HIS, Health Scotland, ISD) local authorities and the third sector (Evaluation Support Scotland, the Knowledge Hub, SCVO and IRISS). The group is now mapping the evidence resources, promoting new partnerships and exploring how best to deliver systematic reviews that are accessible and help our understanding of how people use evidence to develop and deliver services. Two papers on E2A have been produced
3. Capabilities
We have produced a document highlighting the relationship between Capabilities and Christie and have started on a broad range of discussions around capabilities and the National Performance Framework. This stream will recommence after the Scottish Elections. 
4. Community engagement and capacity building 
In collaboration with the Scottish Community Development Centre we have produced new National Standards for Community Engagement. We have also worked with Glasgow Centre for Population Health to develop new guidelines around participatory budgeting and with the Third Sector Interface documenting on their perspectives on representation in the CPP.
5. Evaluation approaches
The development of appropriate approaches to evaluation has been a core component and we have explored the use of Evaluability Assessment (EA) to support planning. We have successfully engaged Glasgow CPP and local decision-makers in an EA of Glasgow's Thriving Places initiative to elicit a theory of change, identify and prioritise outcomes, appraise evaluation options and recommend a preferred approach to evaluation.
6. Governance 
We have carried out the first survey of Community Planning Officials across Scotland. The survey, which closed on 15/02/16 with over a 60% return from 30 of the 32 CPPs will deepen our existing understanding of the community of practice across the country. The analysis will allow the exploration of issues ranging from workforce needs and morale, to community engagement, partnership working, evidence use and leadership, as well as broader questions about public sector reform and the current financial climate. The report is expected in June 2016.
6. Improvement and effectiveness
We have produced a document on improvement and effectiveness and how this is linked to evidence into action. These documents framed a 'State of the Art' symposium at the 29th International Congress for School Effectiveness and Improvement in Glasgow dressed by both the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning. This is now being developed with an emphasis on improvement science and public service scrutiny
7. Leadership
We have captured key learning from The Pioneer Leadership program and have held a series of meetings with key stakeholders to explore the feasibility of establishing an 'Institute for Public Service Leadership'. We have also carried out a market analysis of the demand for a research-based professional learning opportunity for first and second tier (CEO/Director). On the back of this we have developed and launched an MPhil to PhD programme specifically designed to meet the needs of senior public service leaders. 
8. Prevention 
Working in partnership with Health Scotland we have organised three seminars on the economics of prevention and have given evidence to the Finance Committee of the Scottish Parliament. Prevention is a key element of our involvement in the CPPs and has become a key cross cutting workstream, especially in the Case Study work.
9. Spread and sustainability
We have published an evidence review on Spread and Sustainability and this has formed the basis of a framework for implementing spread. Work is ongoing with Aberdeen CPP trialing this framework with practitioners. 
Key risks and challenges to our work identified to date are around the precarious nature of local authority funding and the possibilities of cuts to council services. Many of the staff we are working with are either on insecure or short term contracts and staff changes and changes in staff roles are common. 

IMPACT is built into our methodology and over the last 12 months we have worked with a range of partners on local and national issues and have developed local collaborative learning to better understand what works and what does not work in public service reform. We have become embedded in very complex policy settings and this has allowed us to drive through our impact and to directly affect the way our partners are operating. We have also involved our national delivery partners to promote change on the way they work across Scotland as a whole. We have chosen the following two examples because they demonstrate impact at two levels, one at the level of the CPP the other with a national delivery organisation.
1) What Works in Community Profiling
West Dunbartonshire CPP Strategic Outcome Agreement for 2014 included a specific commitment to develop a neighbourhood based approach to service design and delivery with the aim of both improving service delivery and promoting community engagement. The approach, known as Your Community, involves a process of 'community profiling' and includes gathering data and local intelligence from local services/ agencies and conducting a community survey. We are working with the CPP to develop the skills and capacity of local staff to generate local indicators at varying geographic scales in response to the need for a more localised approach to community planning. The outcome of this work will be a bespoke set of indicators for neighbourhoods in West Dunbartonshire which enable better planning and service provision. We are working in collaboration with Glasgow Centre for Population Health, (GCPH) and Information Services Division (ISD), both of whom have also committed funding to this project. To date we have worked with the CPP staff to identify potential indicators, develop templates for indicators and provide training/ peer support to the staff. 
This work is already starting to have impact across Scotland and key elements are now being rolled through ISD's national programme of work with CPPs. The key contribution of WWS to this development has been noted by Manira Ahmad, Head of Local Intelligence Planning, Performance &amp;amp; Business Development NHS National Services Scotland: &amp;quot;WWS have given us the predictive analysis of context. We couldn't have done it for ourselves - we needed that&amp;quot;.
2) National Standards for Community Engagement
To help Scotland meet the demands for greater community engagement and participation envisaged by the Community Empowerment Scotland Act we have worked with the Scottish Community Development Centre and the Scottish Government to carry out a full review of the National Standards for Community Engagement. We worked to bring together a range of interested parties including CPPs. SCVO, VOiCE (Visioning Outcomes in Community Engagement) users and Community Learning and Development Lead Officers to new standards. The new version of the National Standards will be based on this broad ranging consultation and will be launched in the spring to and will accompany forthcoming guidance on the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015. 
This will have impact across a range of sectors including CPPs, leaders and community engagement practitioners in the public and third sectors. These groups will be the primary users of the Standards, and these will inform strategies and practices across a wide range of organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BF1CAD84-E41D-4CDF-A3B8-233075A2A5BC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e1874a928496.46402212</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A key outcome of our work has been to develop an understanding of people's everyday practices in working in the public sector.

The project started in Sept 2015 and the first set of profiles was published in June 2016, along with a 'how to' guide produced in collaboration with West Dunbartonshire community planning staff.

Notes from WWS/ WD meeting 18/8/2016

Amanda Coultard the local Community planning Manager said that the profiles are helping the Council to build a more holistic picture of the needs in areas and are helping them to have more aspirational discussions about what they can do to improve neighbourhoods. Elected members love the new interactive profiles and are using them on their mobile phones.

So far, the reactions to the community profiles have been cautiously positive. Many of the local staff interviewed by WWS saw the profiles as relevant to people working on a strategic level - many on the strategic level saw them as relevant to policy makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1c6967f8786.59191012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Collaborative Masters Dissertations programme</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>666F3577-1361-4243-9492-64A775463D0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>WWS has initiated a programme of collaborative dissertation opportunities for Masters students in Health and Social Sciences at the University of Glasgow. Through our work in Thriving Places areas of high multiple deprivation in Glasgow, we have brought local public service practitioners into the University to present on their Thriving Places work to Masters students and, with WWS support, to encourage students to do their dissertation fieldwork in Thriving Places, so contributing to the evidence base for the work in those areas (including through writing a Lay Report as part of the dissertation) and building the relationship between the University and some of Glasgow's poorest areas. Academic supervisors also become more informed about Thriving Places and the initiative is seeking sustainability through the involvement of Emma Smith, Work Related Learning Opportunities Co-ordinator, College of Social Sciences, University of Glasgow. One collaborative dissertation was completed in 2016 (url as below), its evidence has been used by health and community workers to influence other public services on the benefit of the Thriving Places approach. One of the practitioners wrote to the student: 'Everyone involved has been really impressed with your enthusiasm and professionalism. It isn't easy to come into an area and a community such as [anonymised] and to be accepted and trusted in the way you have the evaluation methods and approach you took have been enthusiastically received and truly appreciated.' This initiative therefore impacts on University Masters supervisors in health and social sciences, on the research options for individual students, and on areas of multiple deprivation in Glasgow. Six more students are preparing collaborative dissertations in 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b95c27c48af4.27482560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://endeavour.gla.ac.uk/123/1/2016McLarenMSc_dissertation.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of working paper in the background to the roundtable: Enabling environment for place-based approaches and</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00E272D9-1243-4A49-A34F-2C5E0734AD1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impact is to deepen understanding of what it means to create an enabling environment for place-based approaches.
