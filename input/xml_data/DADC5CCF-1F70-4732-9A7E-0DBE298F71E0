NVPEs solution has global reach, where their innovative energy positive ?Low temperature Anaerobic Digestion Lt ADtechnology works at temperatures less than 20 degrees C unique for Anaerobic Digestion. NVPEs solution turns wastewater treatment WWT from being an operational cost into a new revenue stream for prospective customers in Food Drink Industries brewing, malting, distilling, bottling, dairy, meat processing, offering average paybacks of 3 years. Lt AD offers a triple effect of substantially reducing trade effluent charges by more than 60 percent, removing sludge creating biogas that is 100 percent available for reuse to generate heat and or electricity on site. WWT occurs at ambient temperatures, so uniquely no heat input is required for the microbes to work effectively. The low treatment temperatures do not affect the efficiency of the technology, allowing the Lt AD to work at Hydraulic retention times below 12 hours. NVPEs innovation enables customers to treat their the large volumes of low strength WW on site, the technology removes chemical oxygen demand COD total suspended solids TSS concentrations in their WW, allowing customers to significantly reduce their current trade effluent charges. Unlike other WWT technologies, negligible sludge is produced, so sludge treatment disposal costs are minimal. A by-product of the Lt AD process is biogas as the energy generated from the biogas is greater than the energy required to operate the system, it is carbon neutral energy positive. Biogas generated more than 80 percent CH4 content with very low H2S content, which is exceptional for AD can be 10 percent utilised on site for heat and or electricity production through Boiler or CHP systems, which will become an ongoing revenue stream for customers. NVPE will develop a strong business case for the use of Lt AD in a brewing malting application, a key target market due to the low strength WW characteristics and large volumes of WW generated on site. For this business case NVPE will choose the most suitable end-user to deploy a full scale demonstrator on one of their 'live' operational sites. NVPE has engaged with prospective customers and feedback has been that a consistently operating reference site in their industry is the next step before they would consider proceeding with a full scale commercial deployment. During Phase 1 NVPE will select a final first adopter customer and chosen site based on a number of criteria. Phase 2 NVPE will design, install, commission, operate a full scale demonstrator system, treating 500m3 per day, on a brewing malting site to fully validate the technology in this target market at full scale. The ultimate outcome will substantiate NVPEs short payback value proposition calculations already achieved at lab and pilot scale by demontrating consistent operational data for WW pollutant removal biogas quality volumes at scale. This flagship reference site will allow prospective customers to see first-hand the technology treating their specific WW stream providing a platform for NVPE to generate real jobs, revenue &amp;amp; growth. There are more than 106 UK plants where our technology is applicable with the average sized plant requiring 4 x NVPE modules minimum. The payback is 2.5 years with RHI and without RHI the payback is less than 3.2 years, offering a compelling proposition for this target market.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>771128</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971547</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
