Yet such information has traditionally been impossible to leverage at a large scale. Recent advances in computational linguistics and machine learning have produced automatic content analysis tools, which have started to be used in a variety of settings including in text used in social media settings such as Facebook and Twitter. We will apply these for the first time to the open responses collected longitudinally within a large national birth cohort study in order to make methodological and theoretical advances in the study of health, well-being, and successful ageing. 

Our work will contribute to an important policy debate about which social and emotional skills developed in childhood are vital for well-being throughout life, what interventions might support these, and the factors that underpin successful ageing. The techniques applied will also offer researchers working across a wide range of substantive topic areas a methodological model for extracting greater value out of rich but underutilised large-scale qualitative datasets, making this transformational research on both methodological and substantive scientific grounds. 

The project involves three major steps. The first step will be to digitally transcribe 13,000 age 11 essays contained within the National Child Development Study (NCDS), one of the UK's world-renowned birth cohort studies. The data include self-reported essays, written at age 11 and age 50, in response to the following questions: At age 11: &amp;quot;Imagine you are now 25 years old. Write about the life you are leading, your interests, your home life and your work at the age of 25&amp;quot; At age 50: &amp;quot;Imagine that you are now 60 years old...please write a few lines about the life you are leading (your interests, your home life, your health and wellbeing and any work you may be doing)&amp;quot;. The responses (13,669 at age 11; 7,383 at age 50) provide a largely untapped source of psychological and behavioural information that can be linked longitudinally to outcomes for the same individuals. 

Automatic content analysis tools will next be applied to the transcribed essays in order to undertake quantitative analysis of the words and concepts expressed in essays at age 11 and 50. The words used by an individual will be classified into different categories, such as emotions, social relationships, and articles, allowing psycho-social content to be assessed. We will use both 'open vocabulary' and 'closed vocabulary' approaches. 

The classifications derived from open text through content analysis will then be used to quantitatively address a number of research questions, including: What psychological traits and behaviours are reflected in the language used in the essays of a large group of 11 year olds, collected in 1969? What is the association between such revealed psychological traits and behaviours and long-term trajectories of health and well-being across adult life, and early markers of ageing, captured up to the age of 55? How do future ambitions and expectations, as revealed in age-50 essays, relate to age-55 health statuses and practices What degree of persistence can be found in use of language used across the lifetime - between the ages of 11 and age 50, and how does the persistence of traits and behaviours revealed relate to health and well-being in adult life?

The methods developed will be transformative - and will have the potential to unlock information contained open responses in many other national longitudinal data sources. The findings will have strong impact on policy, providing information relevant to schools, local community organisations and health practitioners as to the importance of developing social and emotional skills in childhood and throughout life for lifelong health and well-being.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project assesses how psychological traits, behaviours and social and emotional skills are revealed in the language of children, and the adults they become. Such traits are then assessed for their importance for lifelong health, well-being and successful ageing. The impact of the proposed transformative research will be achieved through both the substantive and methodological aspects of the project.

First, the work will benefit individuals, families, schools, community workers, and health care professionals. They will benefit from the new information that they gain about the traits and attributes revealed in childhood and in mid-life that are important for happy, healthy and otherwise successful lives. Such benefits will be realised through a dissemination programme that reaches beyond traditional academic circles to those working directly to improve young people's social and emotional skills; and to those working with individuals in mid-life to do the same (described in our Pathways too Impact).
 
Second, the work will offer methodological advances that will also be of benefit. In the first instance, the impact of these will be on academics across a wide range of disciplines in the computer and social sciences (see academic beneficiaries section) who are seeking to apply the methods developed to other substantive topic areas covered by the NCDS cohort study, and to other large scale datasets. These academics will be benefit by learning about the methods through workshops held in both the US and the UK, and from the newly deposited essays made available at the UK Data archive. Ultimately, the new work enabled by the new methodologies will generate learning in substantive policy areas (as yet unforeseen), which will also be of benefit to policymakers, practitioners, individuals and families.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have successfully fully transcribed all available age 11 essays from the National Child Development Study, and our US partners in this project are currently analysing them.
The newly transcribed essays are also being prepared for deposit at the UK Data Service.
The data transcription team has noted a 'treasure trove' of rich insights arising from the essays, which we will weave into our outputs from this project. 
For example, Stephen Brown noted some ideas for a book which we are now in the early stages of planning:

&amp;quot;If producing a book based on these essays I would not make it a volume of prose full of dry statistical information, rather a more illustrative, colourful affair, reprinting a representative sample of the more interesting essays, and a few typical examples of the majority of run of the mill essays (eg footballer, secretary, housewife). &amp;quot;
 
&amp;quot;A certain amount of statistical information could be provided for context. For the more outlandish examples, eg moonbases, these could be illustrated with examples of contemporary sci-fi from which the children may have drawn inspiration. Also of interest could be examples of the discrepancies between the children's predictions of 1984 and the mundane reality, illustrated by contemporary photographs or news clippings.&amp;quot;
 
&amp;quot;It might also be useful to draw some comparison between the children's socio-economic status and the breadth of their ambition, illustrated with some sample essays and statistical information.
