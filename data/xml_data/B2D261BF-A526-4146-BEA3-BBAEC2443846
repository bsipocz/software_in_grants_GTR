workers in social housing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I507566/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This interdisciplinary project used innovative Open Space, Participatory Design and Community Journalism methodologies to achieve a high level of engagement with a previously hidden and disconnected community.

Four community-based events were held, at which participants engaged with each other and with a research team consisting of architects, a sociologist of home-based work and a community journalist, to explore the issues that stand in the way of residents of home-based work engaging in home-based work. The Housing Trust partner reversed their policy towards home-based work at the outset of the project, from prohibition to support and encouragement. This provided a secure base from which to run the project. Legitimising existing, and supporting prospective, home-based working social residents, the project contributed to the development of social and economic connectivity and a sense of community amongst a previously illicit workforce. This project has an ongoing legacy in the form of a lively and productive monthly Enterprise Club, an Emerging Enterprise pilot project for home-based workers run by the Housing Trust and a dedicated page for home-based work on the Housing Trust's website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Warwick</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Sociology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Home-based work in social housing</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B8A3BED-D086-4694-BA93-10D84F48BE76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Connected Communities Final Report

The social tenant participants in this project were very keen to work, but struggled to create successful home-based businesses because they 1) lacked necessary literacy and numeracy skills 2) lacked necessary start-up funding form small pieces of equipment eg an ironing press 3) had limited social capital and therefore found it difficult to get their business going 4) found the standard 'Business Plan' route to developing their business difficult to relate to and inappropriate to their circumstances 5) inhabited deprived neighbourhoods where the local people lacked the resources to use the services they were developing eg an ironing service.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>More work is needed to 1) develop social housing designed to accommodate home-based work 2) develop adult literacy/ numeracy, or home-based work that can be carried out by people with limited literacy/ numeracy eg the Community Foster Care project, Gloucestershire.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>83D60FFE-9549-49CF-A1BE-7ABA0DDBC02C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0028a8b16d5.02492289</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Environment,Healthcare,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88448E8F-AF49-4647-AD01-E6594EF76423</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beyond Live/Work: the architecture of home-based work</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fb04a691275dddb3cf9f90c492122ce6"><gtr:id>fb04a691275dddb3cf9f90c492122ce6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holliss F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-58548-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56c5b354122b94.40536696</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9F106F96-36C5-41A5-9458-47C1C87C2B04</gtr:id><gtr:title>Home-based work: a quiet casualty of the bedroom tax</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fb04a691275dddb3cf9f90c492122ce6"><gtr:id>fb04a691275dddb3cf9f90c492122ce6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holliss F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c5bc8c264349.93885947</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I507566/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
