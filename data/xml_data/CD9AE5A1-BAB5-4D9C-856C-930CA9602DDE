Collaborating across borders to the design, development and promotion of an Online Palestinian Arabic Course</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/R004617/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The design, development and promotion of an Online Palestinian Arabic Course (OPAC) will significantly extend the impact of the AHRC project 'Researching Multilingually at the Borders of Language, the Body, Law and the State' (RM Borders). The RM Borders Project was funded through the Translating Cultures themes and led by Prof Alison Phipps (University of Glasgow). The OPAC will expand the impact of the Teaching Arabic to Speakers of Other Languages case study (TASOL CS) of the RM Borders Project through the design of an innovative online Arabic course that is sustainable, grounded in Palestinian culture and language and adapted for delivery in challenging contexts.

The TASOL CS was a piece of action research to train online teachers of Arabic in the Gaza Strip (Palestine). For the past 10 years, the Gaza Strip has been under Israeli blockade. Because of the blockade, the population of the Strip is in a state of forced immobility, unable to move freely in and out of the Gaza Strip. The blockade has resulted in very high unemployment, especially among young graduates, and in forced cultural and linguistic homogeneity. The aim of the TASOL CS was to create opportunities for multilingual, intercultural and professional collaboration between graduates of the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG) - a partner institution in the RM Borders Project - and a team of foreign language teaching experts based at the University of Glasgow (UoG). It consisted in a 60-hour training course for a group of graduates from IUG, to co-explore effective practices for Arabic language teaching through online tools.

The TASOL CS was instrumental in the establishing of the Arabic Center, an offshoot of the RM Borders Project. Housed at IUG, the Arabic Center offers opportunities for online work to the teachers of Arabic that were trained through the TASOL CS. As a practical output of the TASOL CS, the Palestinian teachers have now the opportunity to work online, teaching Arabic learners worldwide. As well as enabling them to gain financially, online work also offers the Palestinian teachers and their international students opportunities to engage in intercultural and multilingual exchanges. 

The first group of online international learners who were taught by the trained teachers at the Arabic Center expressed high satisfaction in the course they completed. However, they also voiced a need for curricula and resources grounded in Palestinian culture, art, literature and heritage and for engaging with Palestinian Arabic alongside the modern standard variety of the language. The OPAC - to be designed collaboratively with the TASOL trained teachers - will be an innovative language course (36 hours, Beginner level) that meets this need, and which offers a unique leaning experience and a pioneering syllabus for online education in/from a context of crisis. The OPAC will also build on the expertise gained through the design of the successful Multilingual Learning for a Globalised World MOOC, an output of the RM Borders Project, and will contribute to the portfolio of work done under the UNESCO chair on 'Refugee Integration through Language and the Arts' held by Prof Phipps, UoG.

The online TASOL course delivered as part of the RM Borders project has already received much attention by academic and non-academic audiences and a presentation on it was one of the few selected for presentation at the UNESCO/UNHCR Mobile Learning Week (Paris, March 2017), which focussed on 'Education in Situations of Emergencies and Crisis'. 

The design, development and promotion of an innovative, context-specific, multimedia, multimodal online course will expand significantly the impact of the RM Borders project, greatly enhancing its economic social and cultural value by ensuring engagement of new audiences worldwide with the work carried out at the Arabic Center, and by providing a template for effective and sustainable online language teaching in challenging contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries for the design, development and promotion of the OPAC have been identified as follows: 
1. The Arabic Center (housed at the Islamic University of Gaza), which will: become a centre for excellence for online language education; build capacity to offer training and advisory services in the field of online Arabic language teaching/learning in challenging contexts. 
2. Language teachers at the Arabic Center co-developing the OPAC, who will gain skills in curriculum design for online teaching/learning.
3. Language teachers at the Arabic Center, who will benefit from having access to a ready-made, bespoke, sustainable course that is grounded in Palestinian culture and art, and tailored for online delivery from a challenging context.
4. NGOs and agencies working with Palestinian refugees, and, more generally potential Arabic language learners, who will benefit from a course that is contextually grounded in Palestinian culture, heritage, art and language, tailored for online and mobile learning, and sustainable.
5. Other NGOs, who will benefit from transferable knowledge, strategies and processes on online and mobile education in challenging situations.
6. International and supranational development agencies, with whom insights into best practices and strategies for online/mobile learning that are sustainable and widely accessible will be shared.

The PI and project administrator will collect information on users and beneficiaries in each of the 6 categories above, during and towards the end stages of the project. Existing networks of relationships based on previous projects will be activated with a database of potential beneficiaries established in the first 2 months of the project. The KETSO participatory action tool will be used to plan in detail appropriate pathways to impact for each of the 6 categories identified. Each Co-I will be responsible for mapping potential users and beneficiaries and for creating communication pathways where necessary. 

All users and beneficiaries mentioned above and wider interested population will be contacted in a variety of up-to-date tools of communications including emails, social media, face- to-face visit, VC and skype-based meetings and activities, messengers, WhatsApp, etc. IUG has experience in conducting promotion and dissemination campaigns using hashtag of such social media. On-going public engagement and promotion will be developed through a weekly blog. This will be kept regularly from month 2 of the project and will collect relevant articles and news as well as provide taster lessons and an ongoing narrative on the project's development. The blog will be liked to a Facebook page and will be tweeted ensuring that the tweet is picked up by linked twitter accounts with a very large number of followers (e.g. University of Glasgow School of Education, RM Borders, Multilingual Learning; GRAMNet). Communication through campaign and international solidarity organisations is crucial to promoting the OPAC. Here the networks of Friends of Palestine and articles in leading Palestinian online media will be targeted. NGOs and international relief agencies (IUG has up-to-date, comprehensive database of such multi-international charity agencies) will be targeted through established links. A project report will also be circulated to all these organisations. Policy makers will be engaged through the presentation and promotion of the OPAC at the 2018 edition of UNESCO/UNHCR Mobile Learning Week. Moreover, the Arabic Center will host a launch of the OPAC to which all organisations working in Palestine/with Palestinian refugees will be invited. Academic organisations will be engaged through journal articles and presentations to relevant events, e.g. the 2018 CERCLL Conference at the University of Arizona.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83737</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004617/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>34457363-5AFA-40BF-BBA6-71DB708DF181</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Curriculum areas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
