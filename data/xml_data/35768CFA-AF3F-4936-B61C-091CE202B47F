It will build upon my doctoral research at the University of Oxford, which centred on the participation of victims of gross violations of human rights as civil parties in international criminal proceedings, and will further explore the development and dynamics of civil party participation at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC).

Victim participation is still a novelty in the realm of international criminal justice, and as such, the trials at the ECCC in Cambodia have appeared more as 'experimenting laboratories' than as processes guided by sound and well-crafted rules and procedures. My doctoral thesis has argued that whilst the apparent benefits of participation seem self-evident, and may lead, at least in theory, to the realisation of the aspiration of restorative justice for victims of the Khmer Rouge, the manner in which civil party participation has been crafted and interpreted in the trials before the ECCC has raised some important
issues and questions regarding its role and impact with respect to the functionality of court proceedings, the rights of the accused, and the rights of victims themselves.

In this context, the proposed research will offer an invaluable platform for me to communicate my research findings to both academic and non-academic audiences. More specifically, the fieldwork that I intend to undertake for one and a half months in Cambodia will serve two main goals. Firstly, it will enable
me to engage with those who participated in my previous research through interviews, group discussions and conversations, by sharing with them empirical evidence and practical understanding of, and insights into, the assumed benefits and harms resulting from victim participation. I plan to organise two separate one-day interactive workshops in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The first workshop will be with the civil parties and victim complainants I interviewed for my doctoral research. The aim is to present my research findings as well as to create a forum where victims as primary stakeholders in my research can participate by sharing their thoughts and ideas. The second workshop will be with representatives of the ECCC, Victims Support Section (VSS), Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC), Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC Cam) and other victims advocate and human rights organisation operating in Cambodia. The aim of this workshop is to present my research findings, discuss current developments of victim participation, and most importantly provide clear recommendations for effective policies and appropriate measures to support a meaningful and active civil party participation at the ECCC. Secondly, the fieldwork research in Cambodia will provide me with a base to further investigate the up-to-date development and dynamics of civil party participation at the ECCC. In addition, the proposed research will offer an excellent opportunity for me to contribute to academic and policy debates on victim participation in Cambodia by presenting my research findings at various conferences and seminars as well as engaging with academic and non-academic audiences with the view to exchanging and producing high-quality scholarship. To this effect, I intend to organise a one-day expert workshop with academics, practitioners and policymakers from Cambodia and the United Kingdom to be held at the Centre for Criminology in Oxford. Finally, following the successful defence of my doctoral thesis at Oxford, both examiners commended my research as an original and significant contribution to scholarship in the area of victims' rights in international criminal justice, and have encouraged me to pursue publication of my work in the form of a monograph.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P009999/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
