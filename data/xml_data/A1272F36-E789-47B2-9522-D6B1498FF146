Arising from the extremely successful Carlyle Letters Online project (450,000 hits in July 2010-July 2011), the newly created Victorian Lives and Letters Consortium (VLLC) is an affiliation of scholars, libraries, and technicians from the US and the UK initially developing an initially free-access, high quality, digitization of the complete diary journals of the art and social critic, John Ruskin, and of the two poets Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper, who published under the name 'Michael Field'. The directors' meeting will be focused on solving the key issues remaining to the group including metadata quality protocols; practical coordination of photography; sustainability. We will consider plans for the transcription and editing of the material through crowd-sourcing type involvement where high quality is assured through the monitoring of established, distinguished, and international editorial boards; and we will discuss the exploitation opportunities at the four partner libraries--Beinecke, Pierpont Morgan, British Library, and University of Lancaster Ruskin Centre--and beyond). The VLLC intends to set the highest standards of digital curation in the long 19thc, and a workshop that brings the key players together will enable us to achieve that aim after more than 18 months of e-discussions, allowing us focused time to solve remaining issues, and agree terms for the implementation of our plans. This stage of the VLLC is intended to be the first step in the establishment of a digital database for life-writing in the long 19thc. In due course, the intention of the VLLC is to expand to include the manuscript archives of major (but not necessarily canonical) literary and cultural figures in the long 19thc in both the US and the UK, and to become the field leader in standards of digital presentation and editing. The significance of Ruskin and Michael Field is considerable in themselves, but they are also, in effect, the pilots of a new approach to research and access to 19thc materials for the 21st century.
 The application is also to support b) a two-day colloquium in the University of Leeds on 19thc (and 20thc) digital curation and editing, which will follow from the workshop also in June 2013. The purposes of this colloquium, which will be open to all interested parties to a maximum of 50 attendees, are i) to bring together academics, curators, technicians, librarians, and students to discuss the common challenges and opportunities in digital curation in the two centuries for literary material (broadly defined); ii) to disseminate the work and plans of the VLLC, including its protocols, standards, and intellectual significance to a wide audience; iii) to learn more about the whole sector's investment in digital curation and its approach to persistent issues of, for instance, technical durability, sustainability, and intellectual quality, and public value. Papers will be invited covering such major topics, and there will also be an open call for papers. It is intended for this colloquium to be highly significant in the development of digital humanities in the UK and beyond, and to provide a major opportunity, in effect, to establish a community and network for those working in the cognate areas of 19th and 20thc curation. It will be partially pod-casted, and written material will be included in the VLLC site when launched. The event will have a major role to play in expanding the range, and depth of research in this area, with its enormous academic and public education potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>a) Technical/curation influence. Of primary importance to the VLLC is insuring that the digitization of the Ruskin and Michael Field manuscripts will be conducted in a manner that satisfies the highest standards of both scholarly and technical expertise in digital curation. In defining these, the VLLC seeks to influence debates about digital editing and curation internationally. Since the VLLC is partnered with the Pierpont Morgan, Beinecke, British Library, and the Ruskin Centre (Lancaster), it has a significant role to play in developing and disseminating protocols of digital curation, including technical expertise and the challenges of metadata in relation to transcriptions and complex digital photography, across major cultural institutions. The workshop associated with this application will enable detailed and final formulation in face-to-face meetings of principles and protocols, and full discussion of the remaining technical challenges associated with content management, metadata, and technical sustainability, which have occupied the directors for the last 18 months. The other major gateway for the establishment of the VLLC's principles in the external sector is through its partnership with Duke University Press and the technical experts in HighWire who advise us.
b) In the development of peer-reviewed crowd-sourcing-type transcription and annotation, the VLLC aims to develop a new way of involving and tapping public interest alongside high scholarly standards as described above. This fresh combination has the potential to set terms for the development of digital editing across the US and UK, which would be finalized in the workshop and disseminated in the colloquium. The VLLC grows out of the Carlyle Letters Online (CLO), and will also use CLO to attract attention to its work and migrate its principles. The directors are active in disseminating the intentions of the VLLC in lectures and in print. Note the VLLC formed a discussion in the BAVS International Conference in Sheffield, 30 Aug-1 Sept 2012, where the PI was a plenary speaker on Ruskin, drawing on diary material. 
c) More locally, the digitized Ruskin/Field material, where it has been known, has already sustained significant social, political, and economic debate, and has the potential to inspire more. For instance, Ruskin's diaries contain: 
i) material of value for the preservation/restoration of Venice (many of Ruskin's drawings in the diaries record architecture no longer present) and a representative of Venice in Peril will be invited to attend;
ii) significant material about the development and nature of British art in the 19thc, that has already informed--and could inform more--major public exhibitions, e.g., 'Turner and the Masters' (Tate Britain, 2010); 'J. M. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite' (Royal Academy, 2009); and 'The Cult of Beauty: The Victorian Avant Garde, 1860-1900' (V&amp;amp;A Museum and Legion of Honor Fine Arts Museum, 2012). The Ruskin editorial board includes the curator Robert Hewison.
iii) significant life material of potential dramatic/creative use that has already helped inspire the motion picture 'Effie' (2012). 
iv) the PI and David Sorensen will discuss Ruskin's economic significance today in a public debate in London in May 2013, drawing on diary material. 
With Michael Field, there is similar cultural/public education potential. Note that Marion Thain, Ana Parejo Vadillo, and Sarah Parker will use the diary notebooks as the centrepiece of a public exhibition as part of their Michael Field centenary conference planned for London in 2014. This event will be in collaboration with the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, which holds some of Bradley and Cooper's jewellery, and the V&amp;amp;A, which holds costumes similar to those described in the diary notebooks. Exhibits will be arranged around excerpts drawn from the diary notebooks, in which Bradley and Cooper discuss their aesthetic preferences and their style choices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21746</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K00395X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AD4F77F-8ADE-4FAE-8B36-11029C350EDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lifewriting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
