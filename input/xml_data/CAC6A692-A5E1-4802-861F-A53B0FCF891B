We know that both these disorders develop as a result of experiencing specific negative experiences and we have strong data as to what these experiences are. However, we know very little about how the general genetic vulnerability is expressed. 

This study proposes that the genetic vulnerability will alter how people process information and think about the world or themselves (cognition), making them more sensitive to stress. 

This study includes measures of cognition and stress within a twin design, which disentangles genes and environment. The study will be a collaboration between two internationally renowned groups: behavioural genetics of mood disorders (led by Prof. Peter McGuffin) and cognition in anxiety disorders (led by Prof. David Clark).

If we can find measures of thinking style that are inherited and that, given specific negative events, lead to anxiety and depression it will be a major advance in our understanding of the development of these debilitating disorders. 

The long-term goal is to predict children who are at risk, enabling us eventually to undertake preventative training with such children and their families.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>OBJECTIVES
A four factor developmental cognitive genetic model of emotional disorders is proposed in which a general gentic vulnerability (factor 1) to anxiety and depression results in biased information processing and cognition (factor 2). Interactions with specific negative environmental influences (factor 3) are associated with specific types of symptons (factor 4). It is hypothsised that information processing is heritable, and that the genetic influence will be general to the development of all aspects of emotion related cognition. In contrast, it is propased that the environmental influences will laregely be specific to individual aspects of cognition and specific types of symptoms.

DESIGN
THe sample will be selected from the MRC funded Twins? Early development Study. Mother-reported emotional symtoms at 7 years will be used to select a high anxiety group (top 5% N=250 pairs) and unselected controls (M=50 pairs) who will be visited at ages 8 and 10 years.

CELLS
DNA is obtained fromcheek cells.

APPROACH &amp;amp; MEASUREMENT
Within the behavioural genetic design a cognitive psychological perspective will be taken to assess biased information processing and dysfunctional cognitions, negative environmental influences, and anxiety and depression symptoms.

OUTCOME
Bivariate genetic analyses will be used to establish the role of genes and the environment on the relationship between cognition and symptoms. Longitudinal behavioural genetic analyses will examine the role of cognition, genes and the environment on the development of anxiety and depression in middle childhood. Associtions between candidate genes and cognition will be explored, cognitive functioning being seen as a more proximal indicator of genetic risk than symptoms.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1994-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6119813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G120/6</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
