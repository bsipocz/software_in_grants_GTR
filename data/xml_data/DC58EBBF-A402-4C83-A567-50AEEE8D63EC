Last year Southern Water launched a universal metering programme (UMP), which is aimed at installing nearly 500,000 new meters in the households of South-East England by 2015. The UMP has been created to meet the challenges that water stress may impose on households in the South-East.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the research project is to evaluate the behavioural response of consumers to the different elements of the UMP. In particular, this project will produce vital empirical evidence on how households respond to changes in the price of water and whether this change lasts over time. The evaluation will include the dynamic impact of metering, tracing the behavioural response through time, and will be segmented along geographical and demographic lines. At the same time, the project will investigate the effectiveness of the information campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the ecological impact of water consumption.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The findings of this research will have major impact on shaping the government strategy on how to tackle the problem of water stress throughout the UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project aims at providing vital empirical evidence to water utilities, the water regulator Ofwat and policymakers. Given that the South East is the first region within the UK to implement universal metering, our findings are extremely relevant for determining whether the current policy of installing a meter to all households is a cost-effective measure to reduce water consumption and, therefore, should be implemented in other areas of the UK. Similarly, this project will be important to assess whether the introduction of a uniform pricing schedule has a negative effect on equity in water consumption. The findings of our analysis are necessary to understand the impact of the UMP on water use for different types of households and this, in turn, will play an important role in starting a more informed discussion on how the future price structure should be shaped to improve equity in water consumption. Moreover, our project will allow to assess the effectiveness of information campaigns and whether, for instance, they could be successfully deployed to face water shortages. 

We believe that involving non-academic users at early stages of the research process provides validation for our research concept and will improve the final impact of our research by helping us to identify research users' needs. For this reason, we are already in contact with some of the key users. In particular, we have developed a close collaboration with Southern Water and, over the next three years, we will have frequent meetings with managers of the company to discuss our research strategy and empirical findings. To facilitate this process, we will also produce interim reports with preliminary findings. 

We are already in contact with Ofwat and the Behavioural Insights Team within the Cabinet Office. We are establishing a dialogue with these users to better understand their interests and will present the findings of our research at early stages through meetings/seminars. We plan to further expand our network of contacts with potential users, like the Environment Agency and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), throughout the course of the research process. At the international level, potential users of this research include the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, and the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme. 

To address practitioners and policymakers, we plan to write non-technical articles for publications targeting these audiences. For instance, we plan to write pieces on Vox.eu, a policy portal aiming to promote research-based policy analysis and commentary by leading scholars, with an audience of economists in governments, international organisations, academia and the private sector as well as journalists specializing in economics, finance and business. We have already contributed several pieces to Vox.eu on previous research projects. We also plan to produce two video podcasts summarizing the results for generalist/specialist audiences, to be posted on the Public Web Domain of the University of Southampton.

We believe the research is also of interest to the general public. To disseminate the results of the project as widely as possible, we will actively engage with the media, both the national ones (e.g. BBC, current affairs magazines like the Economist, newspapers) and the media covering the local communities where the UMP is implemented. In doing this, we will be supported by the Media Relations Office of the University of Southampton.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274578</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Southern Water</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Southern Water</gtr:description><gtr:id>780B8863-2197-4C76-B4CC-182352D4F134</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have written interim report of the data analysed.

The first one on &amp;quot;Managing Water Demand&amp;quot;, in collaboration with the Water Efficiency Network (WATEF), took place at UCL. In this workshop, we presented the results of our work, putting it into the international context through the presentation of policy oriented research done by other academics. Several representatives from the water industry (e.g. SW, Thames Water, Irish Water) took part to the discussion. The second workshop took place the following day at Westminster. Here, the results of our research were discussed in a panel including the former DEFRA Under Secretary of State, the Head of Strategy for SW, the Deputy Director of Water, Land and Biodiversity at the Environment Agency, the Managing Director of Waterwise. This event saw the participation of representatives from Souther-Water and Thames-Valley Water companies, the Consumer Council for Water, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, the Energy Saving Trust, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Green Alliance, as well as several MPs and members of the House of Lords. The results of our research were also presented in November at the meeting in London of the UK Demand Forum, a body including all UK water companies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6a83b0f2976.23215010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of our findings to Thames Water</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6B175A4-03ED-4900-AF72-8883BBFE898D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since 2016 I have been exchanging mails with managers of Thames Water (TW) to discuss our findings about the Universal Metering Programme of Southern Water.

Furthermore, in November SW presented the results of our research at the meeting in London of the UK Demand Forum, a body including all UK water companies. To ensure an impact beyond the UK, we have presented our work to the Land and Water Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome in April 2015 and to the Water Resources Department of the Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity Gas and Water in Milan in October 2015. The University of Southampton also issued a press release that was reported by several media aimed at the water industry, like Water Briefing, the Water &amp;amp; Wastewater Treatment, the Future Water Association, by mainstream media like the BBC, ITV and Bloomberg, as well as by many local newspapers in the UK. 

Some months ago we have been contacted by the &amp;quot;Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services&amp;quot; in Ireland because they wanted our opinion on whether Irish Water should resume and complete the programme of water meter installation in Ireland. 

More recently, in March 2017, we have presented our research to Thames Water (TW). Thames Water is the biggest water utility in the UK and they have recently started their own Metering Programme. We believe that the findings obtained from the UMP programme of Southern Water will be very useful for other companies to understand the reactions of their customers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8CFEADF6-E05F-4FDE-8717-44C8227A3C1F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54524f491277c4.11607844</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has been developed in strong collaboration with Southern Water (SW from now on), the water utility operating across Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire, providing water to 2.5 million people. SW has been the first company in the country to implement a universal metering programme (UMP). The programme started in 2010 and lasted for five years. The main aspect of the UMP is the installation of nearly 450,000 meters, but it includes many other aspects, like the introduction of an optional transitional tariff (Changeover Tariff) and the offer to over 50,000 customers of water audits providing advice on how to save water and energy and the provision of water-saving devices through a team of &amp;quot;Green Doctors&amp;quot; on the ground. In our research, we have conducted an in-depth evaluation of several aspects of the UMP, with the aim of deepening our understanding of consumers' behaviour. First of all, we evaluated the reduction in consumption due to the installation of meters. Our findings of a 16.5% decrease has shown that the programme has performed vastly better than expected (a reduction of 10% was the predicted national average at the start of the programme) and has provided a new benchmark for the water industry. We have also evaluated its timing, showing how households adjust very quickly to the new regime, and the distributional impact of metering, in terms of changes in households' bills. Our research has also showed that despite being available to all customers, uptake of the Changeover Tariff was relatively low. We also found evidence of how information about the programme spread across neighbourhoods. Moreover, we have looked at the effect of receiving a bill on consumption, with evidence of households reducing their consumption in the months after receiving a bill and then reverting to their standard consumption. This finding is particularly important to SW, as it can time its billing cycles to manage peak demand and, thus, optimise its infrastructural investment. Finally, we have looked at the effectiveness of the Green Doctors. We have compared the UMP customers receiving a Green-Doctor visits to a comparable control sample of UMP customers that do no have a water-efficiency audit. We find a reduction in water consumption between 10 and 20 litres per day.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be relevant for Ofwat (the water regulator), the government and experts of the industry to understand the impact of metering on water consumption.
