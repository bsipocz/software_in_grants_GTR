This research proposes an investigation into cultural exchange as an act of translation. It will focus on the transformations sought through the exchange of artists, artistic production and artistic methodologies. With the support of British Council and Arts Council England, THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE forges a research collaboration between QMUL and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro that will map the current terrain of Anglo-Brazilian cultural exchanges. With a particular focus on UK exchanges with arts organizations emerging from Rio de Janeiro's peripheral urban territories, the research will extend analysis of how innovations in the social technologies of the arts seek to translate the city and transform lives.

The research project will ask what happens when artists translate ideas and practices from one cultural context to another: what gets lost and what gets learned in the adaptation? How are those who make the translations themselves transformed? How mutual is the act of translation and how sustainable is the process of transformation? If translation is, as is often said, a betrayal then how do we understand and evaluate the importance of the gaps and losses that open up during the process?

Through a mapping of Anglo-Brazilian arts and cultural exchange projects produced during the transition between two stagings of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (2012-2016), this project will research how we can create new ways of practising the art of cultural exchange. In the context of an intense interest in creating new cultural dialogues with Brazil in recent and coming years, this project will ask how the UK and Brazil translate each other inflected through cultural exchanges mediated by voices from the periphery. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE will investigate how the emergent 'interpreters' and intermediaries of Brazil's own peripheries are engaged in a process of translation through cultural exchanges that can re-interpret UK social realities. The translators in this instance will include young artists and cultural activists emerging in Rio de Janeiro through a series of arts-based projects in favelas and peripheral communities, who will be direct participants in the research process. It will also link these particular artists, organisations and movements to other peripheral Brazilian cultural manifestations, both contemporary and historic.

The research will offer an opportunity to examine processes of cultural exchange involving Brazilian arts practitioners collaborating with a range of UK arts organisations, as they seek to translate ideas, ideologies and forms of knowledge into new contexts. Arts and cultural policy debates in the UK over the last decade have struggled to resist a dualism in which the need to maintain the aesthetic 'excellence' of the artistic endeavour is pitted against the search for a new social purpose and value for the arts. This proposed research project will connect to, build on and contribute to those debates, investigating how radical Brazilian ideas and practices can bring fresh perspectives, alternative frameworks and different ways of working. The investigation will be a collaboration between academics, artists, policy makers, social and cultural agencies to discover other models for cultural exchanges. It will open up the possibilities of different approaches and methodologies for UK arts organizations and policy makers, and aims to contribute to the strengthening of cultural and academic dialogues between Brazil and the UK. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE looks to the peripheral urban territories of Rio de Janeiro for an exchange that offers new ways to translate our own values and experiences in the UK, providing a challenge to ideas that characterise so much of our own cultural debates and perhaps by extension the very idea of translation itself.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Governments: DCMS and the Brazilian Ministry of Culture have created a framework for arts and cultural exchange between UK and Brazil (MoU 2010). This research will contribute to understanding how ideas and practices can be more effectively shared, circulated and transmitted under this cooperation. Heritage (PI) has advised both governments on the ways in which the UK and Brazil can collaborate in the development of new knowledge and understanding in relation to cultural policy, and this research project will extend the ways in which they can create effective shared initiatives. International cultural initiatives developed by the Greater London Authority and LOCOG have facilitated engagement with Rio de Janeiro to build the legacy of 2012, and this research will seek to enhance new strategic collaborations with the cultural secretariats of the state and municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro.
Public sector: British Council, Arts Council England and the Brazilian National Foundation for the Arts/FUNARTE &amp;amp; Ministry of Culture have all expressed strong support for this research as a means of interrogating their own practices in the anticipation that it will contribute to the development of new and more effective ways of initiating and nurturing cultural dialogue. Through their close links with the cultural teams of the Public Olympic Authority (APO) and the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Rio2016), the research team will establish at least one case study that is linked to the Olympic and Paralympic cultural dialogue between London and Rio in order to enhance understanding of the ways in which cultural exchange is inflected and mediated within the wider context of global mega-events. It will also encourage the establishment of international cultural exchanges that extend to and include peripheral communities and territories within the Olympic and Paralympic cultural programme.
Third Sector: UK-based charitable trusts and foundations that promote international cultural programmes (such as the Gulbenkian, Clore Duffield, Jerwood) are often the most active and agile in investigating new ideas and practices. The PI and People's Palace Projects (arts-based research centre and charitable organization at QMUL) work closely with third sector cultural institutions and invite senior representatives to contribute to the proposed seminars. Further circulation and transmission of the research will be encouraged through the trusts and foundations' own mechanisms of dissemination and debate.
Arts organizations: At least 12 arts organizations in UK and Brazil will be directly engaged through the 6 case studies, benefiting from the new understanding within their own practices and the comparative learning with other organizations engaged in parallel processes. Further arts organizations will participate in the 2 seminars and the research will be promoted widely across the arts sector through the networks of the Arts Council England, British Council and FUNARTE (who have offered infrastructural support for the research and its dissemination).
The media: Traditional UK media (newspapers, radio and television) will be actively looking for legacy links between London and Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and the PI will work closely with the QMUL communication team to enable access by journalists to stories and ideas emerging from the research. Many of the artists and cultural thinkers from peripheral territories (UK/Brazil) are extremely active agents in social media and will be transmitting and circulating ideas and provocations throughout the research process.
Local communities: The research is focused on translating processes by which Brazilian peripheral arts organizations transform their communities through becoming new intermediaries and agents in the transmission of knowledge. The impact of this research on a wider public in the UK will be through the translation of these practices through the process of cultural exchange.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>22 minute documentary film by indigenous filmmaker Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro, turning the anthropological observation skills he learned in Brazil on the population of London.

Paul Heritage is Co-Applicant and host to Dr Sousa Silva on a Newton Advanced Fellowship sponsored by the British Academy from March 2015 - March 2017, entitled 'Someone to Watch Over Me: New ways of understanding the Police, culture and the favela in Rio de Janeiro' that combines the disciplines of social work/sociology/criminology and drama, bringing in a network of colleagues including Law researchers and Human Geographers. Paul Heritage has supported Eliana Sousa Silva to make 3 research visits to the UK, brokering contacts for interviews with cultural organisations, police in London, Northumbria and Northern Ireland: London Mayor's Office, Independent Police Complaints Commission, solicitors and Inquest; in Rio de Janeiro, Dr Silva has undertaken field work to gather evidence about the community's experience of policing; and the collaborative research has delivered one seminar 'Dialogues on Public Security' in London, February 2016, and another in Rio de Janeiro, November 2016. We anticipate that there will be further opportunities to continue the knowledge exchange begun during this research project and extend its impact.

2. Both Paul Heritage and Eliana Sousa are contributors to a collaborative research team led by Prof Cathy McIlwaine (Geography, QMUL) which was awarded an ESRC grant application under the Newton &amp;quot;Urban Transformations&amp;quot; call, 'Healthy, Secure and Gender Just Cities: Transnational Perspectives on Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) in Rio de Janeiro and London' (ref: ES/N013247/1) from Spring 2015 to March 2017 (incl extension), on which Paul Heritage acts as UK Co-Investigator responsible for producing the drama and film outputs working with women's testimony. Eliana Sousa Silva acts as Rio consultant commissioned to undertake the fieldwork with women in Rio de Janeiro gathering testimony about their experiences of gender-based violence.

3. Dr Sousa Silva acted as a mentor and collaborator on 'Social Change through Creativity', AHRC Newton funded project ref. AH/N008855/1 on which Prof Morag Shiach (QMUL) was PI and Prof Paul Heritage was the consultant co-curator, overseeing the presentation of the research teams' creative outputs in Rio de Janeiro as part of Multiplicidade Festival. Dr Sousa Silva initially mentored and advised the international research teams on their project proposals, leading an orientating session in a the favela complex of Mar&amp;eacute; to outline the particular nature of Rio's urban socio-economic development challenges for the participating academics and artists, and then partnered several projects to enable them to work directly with people in Mar&amp;eacute;. In the second phase, Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; became not only the host for two of the five days of showcase presentation of the eight research collaborations, but also a key partner on five of the eight collaborative projects, thus partnering with all four UK academics and all five UK creatives who participated in this phase of the work, and enabling them to work directly with people in Mar&amp;eacute;.

4. Dr Sousa Silva has become an Associate of People's Palace Projects (honorary position)

5. Paul Heritage contributed to the launch event for Dr Sousa Silva's new NGO, Instituto Jo&amp;atilde;o Aleixo, and a recent seminar on the culture of the periphery in Rio de Janeiro (15th March 2017).

6. As part of the seminar in November 2016 outlined in point 1, Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; also hosted the re-presentation of Outros Registros, an installation on police violence developed by Nico Espinoza (Federal University of Rio), Rafucko, Samuel Van Ransbeeck (then at Open University) and Tori Holmes (Queen's University Belfast) as part of CreativeLab (AH/N008855/1) and awarded Follow-On Funding for extending research impact under grant AH/P007252/1.

Dr Sousa Silva was introduced by Ilana Strozenberg as a potential contributor to the research, joining the Rio Advisory Group at the outset of the project. Discussions over The Art of Cultural Exchange made clear that there was significant shared ground and potential for cross-disciplinary research collaboration, and this has been activated in several subsequent projects.

Prof Paul Heritage has continued to lead &amp;quot;The Art of Cultural Exchange&amp;quot; research project and maintain the dialogue with Advisory Board members including Dr Sousa Silva.

We have built on the collaboration to reach beyond this specific research project:
In October 2014, People's Palace Projects identified an opportunity to apply for a British Academy Newton Advanced Fellowship for Dr Sousa Silva on a project investigating police violence in excluded communities. We were successful in this collaborative endeavour.

In June 2015, People's Palace Projects with Professor Cathy McIlwaine (QMUL) identified an opportunity for Dr Sousa Silva and colleagues at the Federal University of Rio to collaborate on UK-Brazilian research into women's experience of violence under a Global Challenges Research Fund call for Healthy Urban Cities. This application was successful (ES/N013247/1) and the research project is still active.

In October 2015, Paul Heritage/People's Palace Projects and Prof Morag Shiach (QMUL) asked Dr Sousa Silva to collaborate as a mentor on a capacity-building project run in collaboration with AHRC - CreativeLab. In the second phase of the project, Morag Shiach was lead investigator for research grant AH/N008855/1, enabling the participants to propose and develop collaborative research projects, many of them in partnership with Dr Silva and Redes da Mar&amp;eacute; (see below).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:description><gtr:id>39ED6111-7C05-41EC-A7C7-C3BEEF67A750</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research itself is the output of this collaboration, including the project website, which includes the mapping of UK-Brazil exchange projects during 2012-16: the case studies, and the final report/publication: also the 2 seminars.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9ca4cbddc43.34405904-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Co-Investigator Ilana Strozenberg and her research team are based at UFRJ and the research is being conducted in partnership.

These workshops took place at a key moment in the creation of the new performing company's first show and were very influential on the company's choice of subject matter. Their first show became an exploration of Shakespearean influence on the imaginary, with a story themed around a station master who observes &amp;quot;Shakespearean&amp;quot; characters in the daily life of those around him. The Shakespearean theme supported the company in their aim to make a circus performance with disabled performers that did not take disability as its subject matter, and the performance was eventually seen in four venues around Rio, including British Paralympic House where it was seen as an exemplar for interOlympic cultural exchange between the UK and Brazil.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8e921e7db60.05852998-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Junior Perim (Circo Crescer e Viver) advised on the shaping of the project including selection of Case Studies and curation of the Rio Seminar.

In the year when they celebrated their 30th anniversary following their artistic director's term as president of FUNARTE (Brazil's Arts Council) the event aimed at discussing the impact of their exchange experience in the context of social and geographical inequality in which the company operates. The event was led by Guti Fraga (N&amp;oacute;s do Morro Artistic Director) in conversation with Jude Kelly, Artistic Director of the Southbank Centre, arguably London's largest arts venue, facilitated by Beatriz Azeredo, Social Responsibility Director of Rede Globo, Brazilian largest media company. Speakers included the company's dramatist Luis Paulo Corr&amp;ecirc;a e Castro and actor and director Luciana Bezerra.

The Place of Art in the City also programmed a voice workshop for the N&amp;oacute;s do Morro's young company working together with the British young artists that were part of the project's international delegation. Led by Katherine Zeserson (former Director of Learning and Participation at Sage Gateshead) and Giuliana Frozoni (Projeto Guri) the workshop promoted cultural dialogue and practice exchange between the company and Zeserson/Frozoni whose experience working together emerged from their collaboration in another project which is also subject of one of this research case studies (Music and Methodology).

The event informed the research findings in both Music and Methodology and Brazilian Shakespeare's case studies. Audience and speakers reported new understandings about the impact of exchanges and young delegation worked further on their performance presented at The Art of Cultura Exchange Seminar (Rio de Janeiro) reflecting on their experience as young practitioners from peripheral territories.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f8a5965db6.23841880</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.inter-cultural.com/rio-de-janeiro/1910-o-lugar-da-arte-na-cidade</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Art of Cultural Exchange Seminar (Rio de Janeiro)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>05FFD212-1AA7-4356-8CA6-6EF226A1F31B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Art of Cultural Exchange Seminar (Rio de Janeiro) was a platform for disseminating the research findings to an interested audience and promoting debate around methodologies, practices, research and policy on cultural exchanges. The day-long programme featured over 20 speakers sharing their experience of international cultural exchange between the UK and Brazil, especially on social arts projects. Held at the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Art, the seminar brought together professionals and researchers who represent or have had significant experience in major British and Brazilian institutions, like the British Council, Southbank Centre, Festivals Edinburgh, Tate, British Library, Arts Council, Contact Theatre Manchester, Projeto Guri Santa Marcelina, Ag&amp;ecirc;ncia de Redes para a Juventude, among others, besides government departments, agencies and universities.

Agreement between Southbank Centre Artistic Director, Jude Kelly, and Mar&amp;eacute; Development Networks Director, Eliana Silva, was made to exchange experience and format of WOW Festival, led by the British institution. Discussions informed the writing of case studies and audience reported building of new networks and understanding about challenges and opportunities for producing and designing policies for cultural exchanges.

The final report of the programme is to be produced shortly.

The learning from the programme has fed in to discussions among peers and with AHRC that are helping to inform AHRC's policy and management structures for Global Challenges Research Fund.

Outputs from the research have been made available to a wide variety of arts organisations and the general public, e.g. screenings of Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro's film &amp;quot;London as a Village&amp;quot; which has increased understanding and awareness of Brazilian indigenous culture in the UK and vice versa, and influenced AIKAX's desire to set up a new collaboration with People's Palace Projects that seeks to use cultural exchange as a tool to support economic development within the community and raise awareness of Kuikuro culture more widely in Brazil and the world.

Paul Heritage's article, drawing on the research, has been reprinted in programmes for Complicite's 'The Encounter' on its UK and world tours during which it has been seen by over 100,000 people to date. Paul Heritage also contributed to a series of post show discussions during the Edinburgh Festival and London Barbican runs, some with Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro.

Circo Crescer e Viver selected Shakespeare as a theme for the first show by a Brazilian circus company integrating disabled performers, partly as a result of participating in the research into the ways Shakespeare has been used by Brazilian artists in various contexts, using Shakespeare's &amp;quot;universalizing&amp;quot; position to raise the voices of excluded communities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1EBD155A-2AEA-4E2D-8465-218F5DA67F6C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc5f23c3b5e3.04057280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE project has assisted understanding for policy makers and arts organisations/researchers alike of: 

1. The extent, reach, impact and nature of the cultural exchange between Brazil and the UK between 2012 and 2016 (with particular emphasis on the Olympic legacy projects between London2012 and Rio2016)

2. A range of significant methodological features of cultural projects seeking international collaboration and partnership to take forward issues of social development in peripheral territories and communities

3. How a better understanding of effective practices in cultural exchange can be identified and developed into cultural policy.


The research has revealed how:

4. cultural exchange can be productive as a shared search for active art practices that are social, territorial and engaged in the construction of communities

5. the discernible shift from a focus on homogenised and often pasteurised notions of national identity as defining the purpose, content and shape of international cultural exchanges has enabled alternative voices and practices to emerge that are often far from stable in the internal exchanges within their own country. The process of international exchange is an effective and often powerful means of affirming marginal artistic and social identities at 'home'

6. exchanges between the UK and Brazil go beyond the borders created by the accidents of migration and the restrictions which seek to hold art practices in place so as to redefine what we can be in the world. 

7. the routes taken during the most revealing exchanges rarely follow the paths that have been sign-posted in advance. There is no map, no compass, no clock, no manual that can adequately predict, gauge, measure, define or even record the multiple, unpredictable, unquantifiable exchanges that are made through the process of artistic collaborations across cultures. Our research demonstrates the inadequacies of the instruments we have for translation and the richness of the consequent invention when participants truly trust to open the unknown.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Arts organisations will be able to consult the research as a means of understanding how cultural exchange programmes can be most effectively constructed. 

- Policy makers and funding agencies can use the research to understand where and how cultural exchange is most effective and what steps need to be taken to increase reach, diversity and impact of investment

- Academics can use both the analysis and the range of raw material presented by the case studies as the basis for further research. The theoretical questions laid out in the position papers and the revelations of past/current/future trends in mapping can be used as the basis for further interdisciplinary study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F73D8828-DC83-4C48-A210-56FD229445AA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc608990fc88.92325662</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
