of biosurfactants available for commercial exploitation at the required scale, structure specificity &amp;amp; cost, in the first instance
for home &amp;amp; personal care (HPC) use. We have already demonstrated that saponins can synergise with conventional
surfactants to reduce the total surfactant level required for cleaning performance in laundry detergents, and that such
mixtures are particularly effective at low temperatures. Saponins are plant-derived triterpenoidal or steroidal surfactants.
Saponins currently have limited commercial availability, being sourced from natural plant materials. This supply is deficient
in scale, is of limited structure specificity and is too expensive for Unilever's intended use in laundry detergents. Unilever's
concentrated detergents business alone would require 100 tonnes pa of saponin at 0.1% level and 20% product range
penetration. Leading saponin supplier Desert King produces only 20 tonnes active saponin pa from natural extracts.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that certain saponin structures are significantly more effective than others. The current
sources of saponins are natural extracts and comprise a heterogeneous mixture of saponin structures. Our IB innovation
will enable considerable enrichment for the most effective saponin structures. Current commercial saponins are too
expensive at $35/kg for crude extracts for use in anything other than premium products. We expect IB to be a more cost
effective route to saponin supply.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In a current project (TSB 131168), we have demonstrated production of tailored saponins in Nicotiana benthamiana and
have expanded the synthetic biology tool kit genes and enzymes for tailored saponin bioengineering. However, this
tobacco platform is not sufficiently scalable for commercial production. We need to transfer the saponin synthetic pathways
into a microbial platform. We have selected yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as the most appropriate platform. Our aims are to push science and technology boundaries in multiple dimensions: (1) to transfer saponin metabolic pathways from
model plant platform to yeast and engineer the pathway for commercially viable yield; although an academic proof of
concept of simple monoglycosylated saponin production in yeast exists, further innovation is required to enable complex
hyperglycosylated saponin production and to tackle yield &amp;amp; flux optimisation; (2) for downstream process development and
scale up; (3) to further develop the triterpene toolbox of enzymes, genes and pathways for specific saponin structure
enrichment &amp;amp; production; (4) to further understand the solution microstructure and surface adsorbed layer properties of
mixtures of saponin &amp;amp; conventional surfactants, and (5) to continue to develop tangible benefits and structure-function
relationships demonstrated in TSB 131168 for inclusion of saponins in model HPC formulations, extending the complexity
of the models to include associated detergent technologies such as enzymes &amp;amp; dispersants. The above innovations will
collectively enable a powerful business case for saponin commercialisation to be constructed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in proposal submitted to IUK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>351771</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of the tobacco plant, is commonly used in plant research. Here, the leaf is used as a host organism to produce components of avenacin, a fluorescent antimicrobial produced by oat roots, which protects the roots from soil pathogens. A cluster of genes - the Sad genes - have been identified in oat as the instructions used to produce avenacin. The blue spots indicate the presence of parts of the avenacin compound introduced by inserting some of the Sad genes into the host plant. The other spots are controls to test the expression system.

The image library has the potential to attract new traffic to the NRP institute websites and research group homepages and will allow groups such as the media, schools, the general public and other researchers to gain a glimpse of the great depth and diversity of research that is being carried out in Norwich. Although all the images are freely available to download and use, people are required to sign up to use the library and are asked to enter information at the time of download about their intended use of the image. This helps to capture who is using the library and where the images are being used. So far images have been downloaded 582 times and have been used in presentations, publications, on websites, for education and advertising. We ran an image competition to raise awareness across the NRP site and then assembled a judging panel to select the top 12 images which were used to create an NRP calendar for 2016. The calendar was sent to politicians, business leaders, industry and academics at institutions in the UK and internationally. The competition featured in the local paper, the Eastern Daily Press and an overall winner was picked and used to make a large canvas which is hanging in the new Centrum building. We have received many positive comments about the libraries ease of use for finding good quality, copyright free images to use in presentations from fellow researchers across the site. In October 2016 we put on a two-week, large scale image exhibition at the Forum in Norwich as part of the first Norwich Science Festival. The images attracted a lot of interest and several artists have been in touch with scientists whose research images were on display to set up new collaborations using science to inform artistic practice. We will post outcomes of these endeavours onto the image library website to widen our exposure to new audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda59d056da6.17761102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://images.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NRP DTP Summer Conference 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE72A4D5-59A5-468C-97F0-2211FCCA4B1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NRP DTP Summer Conference 2015 held in the assembly house in Norwich. 15 min talk: Pathway engineering using the GoldenGate MoClo system.

The interactive 'Power of Plants' stand from the Latitude Festival made another appearance at the first Norwich Science Festival with Katrin Geisler coming over from Cambridge University to join JIC scientists Michael Stephenson, Hannah Griffiths, Colette Matthewman, Zhenhua Liu, Nadiatul Radzman, Dorota Jakubczyk, Don Nguyen, Miriam Walden, Jenni Rant and Roger Castells-Graells for two days as part of the Norwich Research Park's 'solving problems with science' weekend. A new addition to the stand was developed by Roger who introduced visitors to the structure of viruses through his challenge to build a giant virus particle. Plants are being used to produce virus particles for use as vaccines and so for visitors this deeper look at viruses in combination with a hands-on experience of mock infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with water enabled the scientists to explain the techniques involved and exactly what is being made by plants in this system. People were very interested in the variety of science on display and asked lots of questions. It was good to showcase our research at the first Norwich Science Festival and to show people locally how far reaching the work taking place in essentially a rural county can be in terms of impact to societies across the globe.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1abd9be82b5.72057106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://norwichsciencefestival.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Great British Bioscience Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B705186E-BC5B-43DD-B67A-FA2D51F9D51C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were successful in a winning a BBSRC science communication award to develop a new science stand called 'Nature's Factories' to run at local events and as part of the BBSRC's Great British Bioscience Festival showcasing the best of British bioscience in its 20th anniversary year. 
Human evolution is tightly linked to our use of plants for food, building materials, fuel, medicines etc., and we continue to look for innovative ways to use natural resources to provide us with sustainable solutions that support our lifestyles. Scientific research is enabling us to discover and develop new plant products that improve our lifestyles by creating better medicines, healthier foods and greener technologies whilst also demonstrating the importance of protecting plant species diversity and ecosystems. 
The Nature's Factories stand was designed to enable the public to find out how science is exploring and exploiting the valuable variety of chemicals made by plants as well as making natural remedies to take away and pick leaves from our fact-tree.

We took the stand to the Science in Norwich Day at the Forum in Norwich (1st June 2014), to the Cambridge Botanic Gardens (19th August 2014) and on the 12th November 2014 used the stand for a training workshop for EU scientists to learn how to create interactive displays for public events. On 14-16 November 2014, our exhibit headed to Museum Gardens, Bethnal Green, London to be showcased at BBSRC's Great British Bioscience Festival. The festival, delivered in partnership with London Science Festival was open to the general public and free to attend.
Since then the exhibit has featured at the Bury St Edmunds family science festival (21st March 2015), the Fascination of Plants day at the John Innes Centre (14th May 2015), the Festival of Plants at Cambridge Botanic Gardens (16th May 2015) and at the Youth Stem Awards (13th January 2016).
