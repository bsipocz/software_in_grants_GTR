By using British South Asians as a case study rather than trying to examine cultural and creative engagement across all BME communities, this research will present a focused analysis of the development of and contemporary place of South Asian Arts in Britain. Given that British South Asians are a well established community in Britain this review will aim to present a chronological investigation of the emergence and development of South Asian arts in Britain. The key research question being examined is 'Why and in what ways do members of the British South Asian community engage with the arts and what value do they attach to this engagement?'

Within this main research question a number of further questions are addressed: How has the South Asian arts scene developed in Britain? Which factors influence British South Asian engagement with particular types of art (e.g. age, gender, religiosity, language, socioeconomic background etc)? What role is played by South Asian arts organisations and which sorts of arts do these organisations offer? How does engagement with minority ethnic art impact on religious identity and conversely how does the strength of religious identity influence engagement with the arts? What cultural value do South Asians themselves place on the arts and how is this manifested in career choices among young South Asians? Who beyond members of minority ethnic communities engages with minority ethnic arts? Why are many of these organisations defined as 'South Asian' as opposed to Indian / Pakistani / Hindu / Sikh / Muslim? Are South Asians aware of any inherent value in engaging with arts relating to their own ethnic and/or religious backgrounds as opposed to engaging with 'mainstream' arts?

This research project will also look to uncover examples of 'hidden' minority arts events which are often only advertised within particular networks and which usually take place in venues owned or run for members of minority ethnic communities including religious institutions and cultural centres. As well as undertaking a review of research and reports into South Asian Arts, an online survey will be used to investigate these hidden events through the networks created with South Asian Arts organisations. The survey will be hosted on the project website and advertised through South Asian networks and social media.

The expected outputs from this project will be:
1. A report consisting of a critical review of the literature on minority ethnic arts;
2. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative online survey made available on the project website;
3. A journal article targeted at the journal &amp;quot;South Asian Popular Culture&amp;quot;, authored by the PI;
4. Conference presentations including the BASAS (British Association of South Asian Studies) 2014 conference;
5. Community presentations to take place at venues arranged by the South Asian Arts organisations participating in the research;
6. Policy briefings for South Asian Arts professionals and relevant policy makers containing a digest of the critical review and recommendations for future practices available on the project website;
7. Possibility of dissemination via the BBC Asian Network and/or BBC Radio 4's 'The Culture Show'

The audience of these outputs will be academics working on cultural value and on minority ethnic arts, South Asian Arts professionals, policy makers who need a nuanced understanding of how different parts of British society engage with the arts, and ordinary people with an interest in understanding the history and place of South Asian arts in Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This section not required under the terms and conditions of the call.

A report was produced over a four month period using literature gathered by structuring searches around four areas in particular; reports and research produced by funding bodies; annual reports and ephemera produced by South Asian Arts organisations; magazines which publish articles relating to South Asian Arts and academic research which examining the lives of South Asians themselves. In addition an online survey was developed which was advertised through social media and
through the various networks created by the above engagement. 

The report has been sent to South Asian arts organisations and will be sent on to Arts funding organisations. The report provides South Asian Arts organisations and funding bodies with evidence of the cultural value of South Asian Arts highlighting reports and other literatures which these organisations may not have previously been aware of. The report highlights the different types of cultural values provided by South Asian Arts in Britain, and makes a strong case for further ethnographic research into the role and place of these arts in all of their various guises. 

The report has been used by a South Asian Arts organisation (SAA-UK) when applying for funding. SAA-UK requested a copy of the report in May 2015, to evidence the need for and the value of South Asian Arts to their participants and audiences. The following statement from In&amp;eacute;s Soria-Turner, Learning &amp;amp; Participation Manager South Asian Arts UK (SAA-uk) highlights how the report has been used:

&amp;quot;Dr Jasjit Singh's paper &amp;quot;The Cultural Value of South Asian Arts&amp;quot; has been instrumental in allowing South Asian Arts UK to develop a more critical reflection and appraisal of its own work and the impact it has on communities (South Asian and otherwise) across the North of England. The paper not only helps us to better contextualize the work we do within the wider UK context, but also provides us with an academic frame within which to justify the benefits of South Asian arts (societal value, health and wellbeing etc.) that we know to be true from our practice, but is seldom captured in data. Aside from being used in annual reports and funding applications, the paper has most recently been referenced by us as part of a best practice case study around music teaching in the UK for national project Inspire Music (focused on the unique teaching approach used in our Hindustani Music Academy). Despite all this, what is clear from Singh's paper, as well as from our own experiences as we look to better articulate our impact, is that research into South Asian cultural practice in the UK is still extremely limited, and SAA-uk would welcome more active academic research in and around this area.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D2DBEB2D-AB55-418B-88E5-EB0A9C57EA77</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ca6fec99a12.65908540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The report discovered the important role played by South Asian arts for people of all backgrounds. Although not all South Asians in Britain engage with South Asian Arts, the analysis of reports into the uses of South Asian Arts found them playing an important role across the generations. For older South Asians engaging in culturally relevant arts with which with they are familiar can be used to transmit public health messages to otherwise hard to reach groups. 

For most individuals learning South Asian arts the cultural value of these arts is not measured in the economic or societal impact, rather it is the lived experience of developing a close relationship with a teacher and actively participating in an art and which relates to one's own cultural heritage which is important. To understand the cultural value of South Asian arts therefore, as well as measuring its value in terms of its outputs and outcomes it is necessary to examine the lived experience of participation in these arts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings highlight that although Cultural Value is often measured by its impact on economic, societal, health and education, for individuals from a minority heritage background, the arts can play an important role in allowing them to engage with their heritage. Could the arts be regarded as one of a number of strategies through which some South Asians engage with their cultural heritage to make sense of their place in the world?
