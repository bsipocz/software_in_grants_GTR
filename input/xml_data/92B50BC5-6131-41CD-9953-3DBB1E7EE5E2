Based on abundant but previously unused sources in Roman archives, this project proposes that Jews were a category of great concern to the innovators of early modern Catholicism in Rome, and that therefore they are necessary to our understanding of it. Conversionary preaching in particular provided an opportunity for understanding and celebrating the distinctive features of early modern Catholicism. More broadly, this project also proposes a new approach to understanding early modern Catholicism, by considering how it was shaped, even at its very heart, by a group external to it; Jews are one case of many. 

Early modern Rome was a unique and compelling laboratory for observing the impact of Jews on early modern Catholicism. Rome boasted the oldest continuous Jewish settlement in Europe, one which predated Christianity, and which grew rapidly in the sixteenth century. But as the Caput Mundi, Rome also generated most of the rhetoric and conceptions about Jews (&amp;quot;imaginary Jews&amp;quot;) that had informed centuries of Catholic theology. Thus in Rome, unlike anywhere else in Europe, real Jews and imaginary Jews were equally robust, equally impossible to ignore, and had equal claims to antiquity. At conversionary sermons, they converged: Before a real Jewish congregation, preachers offered their theological critiques of Judaism as they imagined it, and made an argument for choosing Catholicism. 

Conversionary preaching also captures a moment when post-Reformation Catholic doctrine and priorities had to be articulated aloud and &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; to a public. From the outset, as the archival record confirms, conversionary preaching was always a public spectacle, attended not only by Jews and new converts, but also by elite clerics, ordinary citizens, pilgrims, and foreign visitors. Conversionary preaching in Rome began shortly after the close of the Council of Trent and lasted beyond the early modern period. Throughout this period, a wide and varied group heard these sermons. The rhetorical strategies of conversionary preachers show the incorporation of early modern Catholicism's new values alongside the continuation of older arguments. While missionaries argued for Catholicism in distant lands, and before populations to whom it was unfamiliar, conversionary preachers made their case before the Church's oldest antagonists, and within the very heart of the body of Catholicism.

This project thus considers the paradox inherent in conversionary preaching: that conversion was never its only goal, nor Jews its only target. From the first, conversionary preaching addressed a multilayered, diverse audience, and therefore served multilayered, diverse functions; it mattered both for Jewish-Christian relations and also for early modern Catholicism. This study, and the monograph that will result from it, therefore makes substantial contributions to the historiography of both fields. 

Yet in a city full of foreign dignitaries, new converts, Protestant travellers, international merchants, and others, Jews were hardly Rome's only religious minority. Just as conversionary sermons were pitched to appeal across faiths, it is important to remember that other religious groups could also influence early modern Catholicism, either in ways similar to Judaism, such as external validation, or in others yet to be explored. In this way we are reminded that early modern Catholicism did not develop in isolation but was influenced by other religions even at its heart, in Rome. The project Imaginary Jews and Religious Minorities in Early Modern Rome will also develop a network of scholars studying the impact of religious minorities at the heart of early modern Catholicism, through workshops, panels, and the publication of an edited collection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries within my own field and related academic fields, my project will directly benefit interfaith initiatives and Jewish cultural institutions. My project also has an indirect benefit for the tourism industry in Rome and potentially for the education sector.

Early modern conversionary preaching remains common knowledge and part of communal memory in Rome and in Jewish history. The conversion of the Jews also remains an important topic across Christian confessions. My work would be of interest to various Jewish-Italian cultural institutions in the US and Italy, such as the Centro Primo Levi in New York, the Centro Veneziano di Studi Ebraici Internazionali, and Il Pitigliano Centro Ebraico culturale in Rome. It would benefit these organizations by deepening their knowledge of a subject that intrigues many but is little understood in detail. Likewise, my work would benefit institutions that seek to promote interfaith dialogue and interreligious relations. Organizations such as the Council of Christians and Jews, the Woolf Institute in Cambridge, and the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish/non-Jewish Relations involve academics, clerics, and laypeople in programs of education, dialogue, and social action. My research would provide a historical background to issues that continue to engage such institutions today, such as the origins and history of anti-Semitism, Christian notions of Judaism, and changing notions about the importance of conversion. I plan to engage with these institutions through the videocasts described below, as well as through speaking engagements. I will also promote the results of my own research, and of the related research network on religious minorities, through the project's website and twitter feed. 

Rome remains one of the world's premier tourist destinations, with ongoing interest in the city's Jewish history. In order to communicate my findings more broadly, I will commission a series of three short videos, filmed on location in Rome. Each video will reconstruct a different journey to the Oratory of Santissima Trinit&amp;agrave; dei Pellegrini, where conversionary sermons were held: that of Jews; of new converts; and of Catholics. In each video I will explain the route of the journey and its key buildings, and provide a general introduction and historical context for each group as they prepared to hear the sermon; in short, the videos provide a virtual walking tour. These videocasts take inspiration from the growth of scholarly travel apps such as Hidden Florence, Soho Stories, and Medieval St Andrews. They will be made freely available on the project website and promoted through its Twitter account, as well as through the publicity and promotional activities of the Smart History Ltd Company (which will produce the videocasts) and the University of St Andrews. I hope that these videos will allow tourists to enrich their own experience of walking through Rome and to become more aware of how Jews and Christians interacted in the city in complex ways. It is possible that in future the videos could be developed further into one layer of an app, which might ideally also include include location-aware maps with embedded audio material, links, and documents. 

Finally, the history of Christian-Jewish relations could benefit students as an engaging window onto broader topics. The European Reformation features on US Advanced Placement exams for secondary students, and interfaith relations is part of Unit 4B (Religion and Contemporary Society) of the A-level exam in Religious Studies. Many secondary schools also organize scholarly trips to Rome, and Rome is also currently host to 53 English-speaking university programs in Rome. Many of these provide short modules in the history of Rome. The three videos I will produce will make all of these subjects - the Reformation, interfaith relations, and the urban landscape - more visible and accessible.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N006623/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>61B990B8-E8CF-4876-B8AE-E00F07CCE8C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Church &amp; Theology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70CA9DF8-AFD4-43E6-BEE7-634724581BE7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inter-faith Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D000F682-E202-47E4-9719-60FCBADDFEE8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Judaism</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
