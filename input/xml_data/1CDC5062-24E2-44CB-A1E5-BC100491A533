(HARPS)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L00416X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A vibrant, open and inclusive public space is central to the social and economic health of society. However, developments in digital technology have begun to undermine some aspects of a progressive public space. For example, technologies now allow us to be tracked, surveilled, profiled and socially sorted as we move through public space. At the same time there is a sense that public space has moved elsewhere. The rise of the internet and increasing digital hyperconnectivity has led some to argue that virtual connected networks (rather than physical public space) are where the public realm can now be found. 

In this project, we set out to reclaim the public realm as a physical space for interaction designed to contribute to the public good. The project will enhance the public realm as a space where people can interact under the appropriate conditions of privacy and equality; where the social and economic benefits of contact are maximised, and where barriers to participation are reduced. In doing so we will create a 'model' public space that will also function as a living laboratory. We will equip the living lab with the capacity to track micro-contacts between multiple individuals in real time, and at the same time to capture and process information about the emotional and nonverbal communicative qualities of behaviours across time. In order to preserve privacy without losing critical aspects of personal interactivity we will design protocols which combine data minimization and decentralized data storage with the consensual sharing of information. This will allow us to conduct a series of experiments on the conditions under which contact in public places can produce greater social cohesion and integration. These experiments will draw on the extensive anthropological and psychological literature for the importance of behavioural synchrony for social cohesion and community relations. We will use techniques to manipulate synchronous (and asynchronous) rhythmic behavioural engagement in the public space (marching in step, tapping/clapping, waving). We will use our digitally augmented public space to derive implicit measures (such as physical proximity, remote sensing of emotional tone, physiological measures) of the effectiveness of different interventions for promoting social cohesion. 

As a way of increasing access to public space we will also examine the social and technological aspects of being able to appear in public in proxy forms. In particular we will consider the challenges of having robot proxies in public spaces. We will explore the challenges of veridical robot presence 'in the wild'. We will investigate what motions and behaviours must be transferred to the proxy from the remote user, and synchronised with speech, to enable interactions. We will also conduct experiments which explore challenges around understanding trust in social settings inhabited by shared proxies. Finally, we will develop a framework for understanding the impact of privacy and anonymity in human-robot interactions.

In order to maximise the impact of the research we will engage in partnership with i-Shed in Bristol. iShed was established by Watershed (a cross artform venue and producer based in Bristol) in 2007 to produce creative technology collaborations. Together we have designed a program of impact activities to engage with creative economy SME's and micro-companies as well as artists and community representatives. Through the creation of public space events we will also seek to make an impact on public space policy and practice including governments, policy makers and regulatory bodies as well as the media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on RCUK funding priorities
This proposal supports the goals of a number of funding priorities across RCUK: primarily EPSRC ambitions in both the 'Human Computer Interactions' and 'Robotics' portfolio and ESRC strategic priority 'Influencing Behaviour and Informing Interventions' identified in their delivery plan 2011-2015. 

More broadly this proposal will impact on 3 areas of National Importance:
I. Privacy and and Data Protection: The EU has identified privacy and data protection as critical to realising the full potential of the digital single market, by reassuring individuals their personal data will be protected when they transact online. The proposed research will contribute to these aims both by developing a better technical understanding of building privacy-protective systems, and by developing social science knowledge about the relationship between online disclosure and trust.
II. Increasing access to public space: Two recent (2012) documents by the Department for Communities and Local Government - the 'National Planning Policy Framework' and the 'Re-imagining Urban Spaces to help Revitalise our High Streets' initiative both identify access to and interactions in public space as a key priority for the social and economic health of Britain. This proposal tackles key themes at the heart of contemporary public policy debate. We have already begun discussions with Bristol City Council about the construction of new model public spaces and about the idea of creating living labs 'in the wild'. We will continue to engage with the City Council over the research findings themselves with the aim of encouraging Bristol to become an early adopter of the privacy protocols and the public space adaptations to promote contact and social cohesion
III. Robotics: The Right Hon. George Osborne (Chancellor of Exchequer) in a speech to Royal Society (9/11/12) identified robotics as an area where Britain is a world leader - and argued that keeping Britain at the forefront of developments would be key to ensuring future economic prosperity. By bringing robots into public spaces, and carrying out a series of tightly controlled experimental studies, the project will significantly enhance that goal. We are already in conversation with several robotics companies (including Engineered Arts, ActiveMedia Robotics and Alderbran). Alderbran will nominate a representative to attend project meetings. These links will help to translate findings from the research into the robot manufacturing sector. 

Impact on the creative economy
We have established a key relationship with i-Shed in Bristol. I-Shed are a well established organization with extensive experience in widening opportunities for creative engagement with technology, developing digital practice through a focus on open investigation and audiences.
Together we have designed a program of impact activities which will unfold over the course of the project and which are designed to impact on a variety of different target audiences. We will engage with creative economy SME's and micro-companies as well as artists and community representatives. Through joint projects we will develop educational and learning opportunities at community and school levels. Through the creation of public space events we will seek to impact public space policy and practice.

Impact on the academic community
Finally, and as befits a large and interdisciplinary project such as this, we will disseminate our findings through papers in academic journals and delivered at conferences. We have targeted the top conferences in psychology, HCI, privacy and security, mobile sensors and localization, affective computing and robotics and robot-human interactions. We will also publish in the top ranked journals of our sub-disciplines - and aim to produce several collaborative papers aimed at 4* cross-disciplinary publications like Science and PNAS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2044336</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pierre and Marie Curie University - Paris 6</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cambridge - UPMC collaboration on human-robot itneraction</gtr:description><gtr:id>E4B19725-24CA-4BC5-8C7A-9F3214E65CBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The following journal paper:

The BRL team brought their NAO robot to the event and visitors were able to talk to each other via the NAO robot using remote presence and communication. NAO was able to copy its controller's arm and head motion (using a Microsoft Kinect), and relay sound (using headphones) and vision (using an Oculus Rift), so the controller had embodied communication.

The results were many informal discussions with members of the public (mainly families and young children) about the technology behind remote presence and the possibilities of using robots for remote presence communication.

We had many requests for further opportunities to 'meet' the other robot platforms that will be used during our research.

Visum 2016 was the 4th VISion Understanding and Machine intelligence (visum) Summer School that targeted to gather at Universidade do Porto, Portugal, Ph.D. candidates, Post-Doctoral scholars and researchers from academia and industry with research interests in computer vision and machine intelligence. Considering the existing gap between the most fundamental concepts of computer vision and their application in real world scenarios, the realisation of visum school seeked to bridge these two key domains. By creating an expert multicultural environment, visum school aimed to foster junior researchers' awareness of computer vision topics, as well as to enhance all attendees' knowledge regarding the state of the art, provided by leading international experts on the field. Visum comprised three main tracks: fundamental, industrial and application topics, each one with extensive practical `hands-on' sessions. The goal was to enable questioning and cross-fertilization of ideas through being exposed to multidisciplinary topics and tasks, potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in the development of the theses of the student participants. Participants reported that this was indeed their experience during the summer school.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adbc8d20e855.29534206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://visum.inesctec.pt/visum-2016-4th-edition/#1479315639507-7900b722-1060</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University of Oxford issued a press release in promotion of the Being There project and particularly the public Showcase event.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EB88CB9-31CD-4C56-9728-B68B7E1C59C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>University of Oxford issued a press release (13/09/16) in promotion of the Being There project and particularly the public Showcase event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a2811f051b7.41400500</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Supporters</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/1181-full.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paul Bremner was an invited speaker at the Workshop on the Future of Social Robotics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B208A6D-C080-42B1-A934-BC6A4EE47AF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paul Bremner was an invited speaker at the Workshop on the Future of Social Robotics, held at the University of Oxford, on 2nd June 2016 - where he presented &amp;quot;Humanoid Robots as Physical Avatars for Telecommunication&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588793cf5c1497.39688146</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://roijers.info/srworkshop.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hatice Gunes was interviewed by BBC Click, aired on the BBC World Service.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4AC726C-924A-40DB-9E90-BFF5A2C601E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hatice Gunes was interviewed by BBC Click, aired on the BBC World Service, 20/09/16 (Dr. Gunes is feature at 12.30-20 minutes).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588a09d3b31c25.23829163</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p047p4dp</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest speaker, Science club, St. John's Catholic Primary School, Bath. 28/01/2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A381D617-14A2-4A4B-BF92-BA3316CC0815</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Chris Bevan hosted a 1.5 hr science club with 21 6-11 year old school children around the theme of future social robotics.

The purpose of the invitation and the talk was to expose the participants to research topics that would be somewhat outside their area of expertise and the scope of the workshop - personality computing and human-robot interaction. The audience was very engaged, asking questions about HRI and providing suggestions. This keynote talk led to Dr Hatice Gunes being invited to give other seminars and talks on similar topics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adb9682b9b36.25652730</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2988257.2988271</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford London Lecture 2014, 18 March 2014, London UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5737B8A8-DAE8-4DA9-A13D-D777E8A173D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Ian Brown (University of Oxford, Oxford Internet Institute) presented at the Oxford London Lecture 2014.

Three days of intensive collaborative working between academics and creatives in public space resulted in a public demonstration (in the caf&amp;eacute; of Watershed) of the work produced. Total audience of 45 (including the public and our academics and creatives) plus 60 viewers watching a live stream of the demonstrations via Periscope. 

Videos of the demonstrations of the activities are available via the Being There project YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEM5ziLYmv8mZH-xFuJEZgw 
The event was recorded on Storify and has to date had 40 views: https://storify.com/BeingThere/being-there-lab-at-watershed

Resultant of the workshop, several concrete plans were made for future related activity, involving partnerships between researchers and creatives. The workshop led directly to Bath partnering with puppeteer David McGoran for ongoing research relating to robot eye design and eye movement.


No impacts outside the project team at this stage. However, within the project team there were lots of new collaborations born during this event. The teams of creative and academics have gone on to work together on small projects which will be used as part of our project deliverables at our public space event in Spring 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55a4d9cda5de82.91544841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.being-there.org.uk/blog/30/06/2015/being-there-lab-summary</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>an invited research seminar on 'Affective and Social Signal Processing for Human-Computer-Robot Interaction' at the University of Cardiff</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB9B2CED-1F81-4F5D-B2E3-DAFDE9E03DFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Hatice Gunes gave an invited research seminar on 'Affective and Social Signal Processing for Human-Computer-Robot Interaction' at the University of Cardiff on 8 February 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adc01a8b3308.76183895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/events/view/affective-and-social-signal-processing-for-human-computer-robot-interaction/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Live interaction with Emo and demonstration of &quot;Teach Me Emotional Intelligence&quot; - At Bristol Science Center's Robot Encounters Season</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0696DCB0-5CFD-448A-A5AF-C3C16AE51541</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Live interaction with a small humanoid robot called Emo and live demonstration of &amp;quot;Teach Me Emotional Intelligence&amp;quot; At Bristol Science Center's Robot Encounters Season (7 August 2016) through the Meet the Experts event.

Professor Danae Stanton Fraser and Dr Chris Bevan (University of Bath) delivered an interactive demonstration as part of the 'Are Friends Electric' themed event on 21 May 2014 at The Bell Inn, 103 Walcot St, Bath, BA1 5BW. Prof. Stanton Fraser presented face to face with the audience whilst Dr Bevan participated via the Nao robot tele-presently. The interactive talk outlined the work that Prof Stanton Fraser and Dr Bevan are exploring. A recording of the event can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8rxM9oUC3s

Subsequent to attending the talk, Lauren Barnes, a Psychology undergraduate at Bath elected to spend her placement year working in the CREATE laboratory. Lauren will be assisting Chris Bevan on current / future Being There project studies. Several audience members have subsequently participated in Being There experimental studies conducted at Bath. Dr. Bevan was also approached to give a talk on social robotics to students at the Bath College.

The demo paper 'Let me Tell You about Your Personality! Real-time Personality Prediction from Nonverbal Behavioural Cues' by Oya Celiktutan, Evangelos Sariyanidi &amp;amp; Hatice Gunes received coverage on Slovenian national TV http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/prispevki-in-izjave-slov enska-kronika/174334071 and http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/roboti-ki-zaz navajo-bolezni-znacaje-ljudi.html
2) Project member Hatice Gunes organised an one-day workshop on &amp;quot;Emotion Representation, Analysis and Synthesis in Continuous Time and Space&amp;quot;. Wenxuan Mou also presented her paper on &amp;quot;Group-level Arousal and Valence Recognition from Static Images: Face, Body and Context&amp;quot; by Wenxuan Mou, Oya Celiktutan and Hatice Gunes. 

These activities also resulted in an invitation to collaborate with the Institut des Syst&amp;egrave;mes Intelligents et de Robotique in Paris, France (ISIR: http://www.isir.upmc.fr/) where Hatice Gunes and Oya Celiktutan then worked for the month of June 2015. This collaborative work resulted in a journal paper (ongoing).


The demonstration received a lot of interest from media as well as international researchers that work in the area of face and gesture recognition, social robotics and affective computing.

The 'Spectrum' programme on DW Radio interviewed the PI of the grant (Levine) for a programme aired on 3 March 2014 (9826142A_2-podcast-1953-17455529.mp3).

We received a couple of emails from members of the public who were interested in the research and wanted to know when our public space trials were planned because they were keen to come and meet the robots. The enquiries were not directly linked to the research we are working on, they were interested in other research (into autism) using robots.
We received several enquiries from the media who wished to write about the project.

Peter Gibbons (BRL) will present how gesturing is used by both robots and animals as a form of non-verbal communication.
Robots vs Animals runs interactive sessions for Years 8 or 9 at Bristol Zoo as part of their Education Centre provision for schools. In each one-hour session, students learn how animals are the inspiration for new technologies - biomimetics and bio-inspiration. Incorporated into each session is the chance to interact with live animals and state-of-the-art robots from the Bristol Robotics Lab - from touch sensors based on rodent whiskers to electricity production inspired by digestion processes. Students will gain first-hand insight into the scientific processes of research, developing prototypes and experimentation. The sessions will be co-led by BRL robotics engineers and Zoo education officers. Together, they will bring to life the connections between diverse scientific disciplines. They can show students how robotics research is being applied to solve real-world problems such as finding clean energy sources and better surgical tools. The sessions have just started and will continue to run until April 2015.

Dr Bevan discussed the technical and psychological challenges (and opportunities) of human-robot interaction as a research topic and a future career opportunity to around 90 students.

The talk was very well received by staff and students at the college. The following quote was received from Bath College's head of department for Engineering, Construction and Computing: &amp;quot;We recently invited Dr Chris Bevan to The City of Bath College as a guest lecturer. Chris delivered an inspirational session on robot and research to our Foundation Degree and BSc Honours Computing students. The feedback from the students on the talk was excellent. Chris' session has prompted them to ask many interesting questions about robots, technology, research and equipment used to date. On behalf of the college, I would like it to be recorded that Chris did a great session and as such must be congratulated. We hope his next talk is as successful as the one he gave here&amp;quot;. 

Several students have since contacted Chris directly about participation in future studies, strengthening links between College and University.

The project also made significant advances in understanding features of the Nao robot platform which contribute to improving usability and trust. These have implications for the development of subsequent generations of the robot platform.

Through engagement with museums and creative industry showcases the project has also advanced public understanding of telepresence robotics as a tool for tackling social isolation and improving civic participation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A0560CA1-9212-4D04-B695-2A483CA47F79</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e16f425adec9.18142654</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project delivered interdisciplinary and partnership working from the start - involving creative industry partners in the science from the start and integrating researchers from a diverse range of academic disciplines. The collaborative method employed over the course of the project meant that we were able to leverage the skills of the creative industry partners to do better science and to ensure maximum impact of the research and dissemination activities. 

The project made significant advances in several disciplinary areas. These included developing better indoor localization capabilities; greater sophistication in remote emotion sensing; advancing understanding of trust and influence in telepresence robotics; new insights in the psychology of coordination and influence in public space.

The rich collaboration between academics and creative industry partners were synthesized in three projects which involved engagement with the public in public spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many interesting research questions remain for the academic partners. The interdisciplinary collaborations which have been forged will enable those questions to be addressed in new and fruitful ways.
