She pioneered the use of avant-garde techniques in Britain, developing an intelligent painterly response to art from the Continent. Historians have failed to give an adequate account of her critical, cosmopolitan practice, instead dwelling on her supposed Englishness, unconventional friends, and perceived inscrutability. Bell's reputation as a Bloomsbury bohemian with a complicated private life and as a wordless painter whose pictures 'do not betray her' (to quote her sister, Virginia Woolf), has discouraged close examination of her art. She remains overshadowed by other painters of her time as well as by Woolf, who have been canonised as the result of lengthy campaigns to establish their importance. \n\nMy project on Bell's 'experimental work' will transform the way we see her. It will argue that her work made an innovative contribution to modern art, and that it was driven as much by its own developmental logic, as by her exceptional familiarity with the European avant-garde. Working on the hypothesis that her art constituted an acute intervention in the critical debate about modernism, it will argue that she conducted a visual conversation with her literary colleagues, testing the limits of formalism through her radical abstract paintings of 1914, and exploring the emotional impact of visual representation in the absence of conventional narrative. This aspect of my research contributes to recent debates in Word-and-Image studies concerning the rivalry between artists and critics in the early twentieth century. It also complicates the relationship between Bell and Woolf, as I argue that Bell's method of conveying character through form and ellipsis anticipated the literary techniques which Woolf later developed. \n\nMy study of Bell challenges the agenda of British art studies, repudiating its emphasis on national tradition, and highlighting the international networks which shaped art in Britain in the early twentieth century. The idea of nationalism has dominated the humanities, fundamentally shaping disciplines: we specialise in national schools, and major artists are jealously guarded as national possessions, however international their lives and artistic practices. I shall present Bell as a case-study for a more expansive approach which takes account of the vigour of internationalist thinking in the period, the cosmopolitan nature of artistic communities, and the permeability of cultural borders between nations, even in an age of rising nationalism. Bell's status as a British artist, despite her ambivalence towards her country and her responsiveness to European art, demonstrates the importance of thinking outside the terms imposed by national schools, towards a more fluid and inclusive understanding of cultural identity.\n\nI shall root my discussion in close visual analysis of Bell's art works, developing a contextual, historical analysis which resists biographical anecdote. Her work is largely located in museums and galleries in the UK and USA. British locations include London galleries (the Courtauld, Tate Britain, the National Portrait Gallery, the V&amp;amp;A), the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, the Charleston Trust, Sussex, the City Art Galleries, Sheffield, and the University of Leeds Art Collection. US locations include New York (the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art), the Yale Center for British Art, and Smith College Museum of Art. Archival collections of Bell's own writings which I shall consult are housed in Tate Britain, King's College, Cambridge, the University of Sussex, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. For the writing phase of the project, I shall be based at the University of Bristol, where I have the support of my mentor, Professor Elizabeth Prettejohn, and an active interdisclinary research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries from the research will include the wider public, galleries and cultural policy makers. \n\nA major outcome of my research will be an exhibition, entitled *Vanessa Bell: The Experimental Years*, and expected 2014. I am currently in discussion with Pallant House Gallery, a gallery of modern art which holds one of the best collections of British art in the world, and which would like to host the show. The exhibition would greatly increase the impact of my research, disseminating my findings to the general public as well as to art historians and curators. I would expect it to travel to an overseas gallery, for example the Yale Center for British Art, thereby ensuring an international impact. \n\nCultural policy makers would benefit from my research into Bell's European connections, and its curatorial application. There is a growing movement among museums and galleries to emphasise cross-cultural relationships, partly as a result of increasing globalization, partly through the recognition that it is historically invalid to demarcate the arts into distinct national schools. My research, and its published and curatorial outputs, would reinforce this tendency among major cultural institutions. In particular, it would benefit Tate Britain, a major collector of Bell's paintings, which has redefined the scope of its collection as 'Art in Britain', rather than as 'British Art'. \n\nMy monograph on Vanessa Bell would attract a readership beyond the academy, appealing to the growing public audience which enjoys exhibitions and seeks a more educated understanding of modern art. As a Bloomsbury artist, Bell is a familiar name to many people, and a detailed analysis of her work would cater to a public as well as an academic need.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Impact from the project is developing in two fields:

1) Scholarship made publicly available through galleries and exhibitions. 
a) I wrote an exhibition catalogue entry on Vanessa Bell for the exhibition 'The First 50 Years of The London Group 1913-63' (Ben Uri Gallery, London, 2013).
b) I advised on the exhibition 'Vanessa Bell* (Dulwich Gallery, 2017), and contributed an essay to the catalogue.

2) Scholarship made publicly available online:
a) I co-authored and edited a study of Vanessa Bell's Abstract Painting for the Tate Gallery website, as part of their 'In Focus' series on key works in their collection.
b) I supplied an entry on Vanessa Bell to the 'Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism' (due 2016), which aims to be the most comprehensive, and most publicly accessible, source of information about global modernism.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F8E6A938-2D65-4E4D-A0D6-2D5A2602E5F2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545363b4d56a79.58417006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) I have developed a new argument about how Bell used the idea of conversation in her art. Exhaustive reading of Bell's unpublished letters (in archives in London, Cambridge and New York) has demonstrated that Bell took a conoisseurial interest in the art of conversation, both her own and other peoples. This feature of the letters, combined with a persistent theme of groups and conversations in her paintings, has led me to develop an argument about sociability in her art, that undermines previous readings of her work as silent and lonely, and suggests a missing link in the twentieth-century revival of the Georgian 'conversation piece'. 

2) My research has drawn attention to the contribution that Bell made to European modernism during her 'experimental period'. Debunking the idea that her art was derivative of the European, I have argued that her painting and collage responded conversationally and at times critically to the new art from Europe. I have written, for example, about her intelligent response to the example of Picasso and Matisse, and her original contribution to the first generation of abstract painting. The model of response as conversation that I develop contributes to wider debates in the discipline about the nature of influence, and the balance of the relationship between British and European cultures in the early twentieth century. 

3) My work has challenged the predominantly biographical approach to Bell, both through an outright critique of such a methodology as it applies both to Bell and to British art more widely; and through the demonstration in my writing of an object-based analysis. The opportunity afforded by the AHRC grant to travel to see works by Bell in the original, and to examine their material qualities, has been crucial to my case that they should be treated as 'mobile' objects (mobile, that is, in terms of the contexts in which they can operate), rather than as illustrations of Bell's life-story. The result has been to widen the range of possibilities for reading Bell's work eg. through studies of reception, political contexts, and visual comparison both historical and ahistorical. 

4) I have placed publications arising from the research with prestigious journals: *Art History* (the leading journal for the discipline in the UK), and Tate online which aims to disseminate high-level scholarship to a wide public readership. I have a third article in preparation for submission to *British Art Studies*, the new flagship online journal of the Yale Center for British Art. Such a range of high-level publications enhances Bell's artistic reputation, and makes her work known to a wider readership, both academic and non-academic.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research will be used in exhibitions about or including Bell, for example, in *Vanessa Bell* (Dulwich Picture Gallery, 2017).
