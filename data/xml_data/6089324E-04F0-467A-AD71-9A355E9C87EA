They are involved in the provision of core rehabilitative and resettlement services (such as drug and alcohol treatment, employment and training, housing aid and advice) and are recognised as providing a valuable link across the transition from custody to community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus of the seminar series has particular importance in each of the countries represented in this collaboration, where the growing role of voluntary and community organisations in efforts to reduce reoffending has developed as a prominent - and sometimes contentious - issue in recent years. Indeed, in England and Wales this topic has become especially relevant in the context of recent developments around the Ministry of Justice?s Payment by Results and Social Impact Bond agenda, which has gained international attention as an innovative and unique pilot scheme. The seminar series will be made up of a series of stand-alone events, with each exploring in depth the specific issue devoted to it.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The changing role of third sector involvement in prisoner reentry in Europe and North America provides an especially significant and timely area of academic research in criminal justice. As well as being international in scope, the proposed activities are inter-disciplinary and will bring together academic leaders and future leaders in order to exchange ideas and promote future opportunities in partnership with practitioners, policy makers and other research users.
The proposed activities are feasible because they will be based on summarising, discussing and expending an existing but highly dispersed and fragmented body of academic and policy research on the changing role of the third sector in Criminal Justice, led by a team of national experts in their fields. The activities are innovative because, to our knowledge, the seminar series represents the first international collaboration in this field of study. The proposal is timely and interesting from an academic, practitioner and policy maker perspective because it seeks to identify and develop key academic debates in this rapidly changing field. The proposed activities are committed to the active development of a community of academic and practitioner users. This is more than simply the dissemination of findings, but represents the development and maintenance of a European research group through a dedicated Website and a number of research and practice seminars. 
The activities will have a significant impact on both academic and non-academic beneficiaries concerned with third sector involvement in reentry. The first group of beneficiaries is academic. There are a growing number of scholars who are interested in the role of TSOs in Criminal Justice more broadly, and prisoner reentry more specifically, and the seminars will be ground-breaking in the way they enable and promote an exploration of these issues in a cross-European and North American context. The project will also open up the possibility of new avenues of quantitative, qualitative and/or theoretical research directions and will result in a number of publications.
The second group of beneficiaries are practitioners and policy makers - actors who promote and/or organise third sector involvement in Criminal Justice. The ongoing involvement of TSOs will ensure widespread dissemination of the research findings through seminars, the project website, expansive email lists and publications. We will also draw on the experience of practitioner engagement in the Third Sector Research Centre (Universities of Southampton and Birmingham) and the wide network of practitioners that each of the researchers has developed in their research to date.
The final beneficiary group represents the offenders who are affected by developments in the role of TSOs in criminal justice. The research team are experienced in promoting user-involvement in research planning and dissemination and continued service-user involvement will be embedded in the design and dissemination of the seminars. The research team are experienced in promoting user-involvement in research planning and dissemination and continued service-user involvement will be embedded in the design and dissemination of the seminars.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21341</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J019801/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>6089324E-04F0-467A-AD71-9A355E9C87EA</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019801/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>21341.82</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>84F8EAE0-23ED-4202-A02E-06E65970B8BA</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019801/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>20155.82</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
