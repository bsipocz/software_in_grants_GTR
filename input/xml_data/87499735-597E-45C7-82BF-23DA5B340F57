Move</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L007576/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Place is fixed, but people move. Bristol's peoples move through life and across the city; they move to it and out of it; they move across the globe, and - sometimes - back again. This fluidity runs along and around fixity: ties to people and places elsewhere, which link individuals and the city itself to other points around the world, as well as the immobilities of 'marginalised' communities. This project explores strategies and tools - digital and otherwise - to trace and link the fluid and the fixed.

Know Your Bristol On The Move builds on a track record of community co-production initiatives and the 2012-13 AHRC 'Know Your Bristol' and 'Know Your Bristol Stories' projects, collaborations with Bristol City Council's Know Your Place (KYP) team and community partners, which developed a heritage research co-production toolkit. This helped partners develop community archives to support their own research, and showcased how they could be used in the KYP web resource www.bristol.gov.uk/knowyourplace. This award-winning resource, launched in March 2011, provides greater access to archives, encourages community interaction with and reuse of this material, informs neighbourhood planning exercises, and enhances Bristol City Council records through direct community, or crowd-sourced contributions to the Historic Environment Record (HER). 

Our project asks key questions:

1) how does the collection, interconnection and presentation of contemporary, crowdsourced digital materials created and shaped through community partnerships generate new understandings of history on the move?
2) how do mobility and longer histories of dwelling affect people's senses of place and how might this be visualised with digital mapping tools?
3) what are the conceptual and technical challenges involved creating digital networks across different archival sources, existing tools and institutional structures?
4) how might the intellectual property inherent in cultural heritage be shared across communities, research institutions and the public sector and what questions about ownership and data management might be generated by different approaches to web-based tools and mobile applications? 
5) how might communities co-develop archival frameworks to include domestic and informal materials that produce new understandings and experiences of place?
6) as one size will not fit all and given the diversities of (and within) communities concerned, what repertoires of complementary tools and approaches might best support and enable different 'types' of group?

To answer these questions, the project will create: a mobile view of the existing KYP site, a new platform for community digital mapping, as well as two new apps for it. A 'Know Your Bus' will form a different kind of sustainable mobile platform: a space for digital creation and co-production of research and learning, an equipped space that can travel to sites &amp;amp; communities. We will augment an archive at the heart of the Council's infrastructure, and we will explore the creation of mobile archives, treasure chests for family history. We will work with 8 different communities, co-developing and assessing different portfolios of tools for community research, deploying high-, low- and no-tech, working with makers, artists, software developers, the old, the young, communities of interest and communities of place. We will build on the City Council &amp;amp; University of Bristol collaboration, as well as related activity more widely within the university and city.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Know Your Bristol on the Move will impact on a range of beneficiaries outside of academia, both during and after the project. The most immediate impact will be on community partners and this includes giving a voice to communities who may feel excluded from research and decision-making processes. The Know Your Place web resource is a direct link to local planning policy and placemaking, managed by the Bristol City Council Planning Department. Any contribution to the web resource by a member of the public becomes potential material consideration within planning decision processes. In this way communities directly contribute to the shaping of their neighbourhoods. They can express the values they have around parts of their neighbourhood that others may overlook. This project focuses on value as emergent rather than fixed. Events and collaborative activities will enable each community to tailor toolkits to their needs and to develop ownership frameworks for their own Community Maps and digital assets. The project will draw on research developed internationally about cultural heritage and intellectual property (http://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/) in order to address questions of different levels of community access and shared use; as such, this project has the potential to impact on the ways in which digital community assets can be governed by communities themselves, while retaining the regulatory power involved in planning processes. In short, communities, local planning policy and national and international bodies and policy makers with cultural heritage remits have the potential to be impacted by this project. Due to the immediacy of technical development, impacts at local level will be realised during the lifetime of the project, while impacts at national and international levels would be expected within a year following the end of funding.

Another impact will be on wider multiple and diverse users of the KYP site and the technical developments created in the project. The mobile interface will allow maps, trails and pathways to be followed in situ, not just by the communities that developed these resources but by other inhabitants of Bristol and visitors to the city. The apps for mobile devices will enable the collection and presentation of information on the move and facilitate physical user interaction. This in turn will help increase the amount of information available, thus increasing the value of the site to those who use it. More data also benefits the City Council who use the information in their own decision-making processes about the future of Bristol. By joining an international network of projects working with geographical data, digital archives and communities, the specific technical challenges and approaches to landscape characterisation presented by Know Your Bristol On The Move has the potential to impact on global public sector initiatives and to inform community-led cultural heritage tourism. 

KYP, its technical developments and the stories and materials collected during the project will be publicised through the University's existing communication channels, the project website and blog, the films and the commemorative booklet. Communities will also be able to design their own communication strategies, facilitated as necessary by the University and project partners. The learning around engagement and co-production will be shared with other organisations, primarily through the CPE and its links to the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE). The NCCPE has established a Community Partner Network which aims to influence Higher Education policy and practice and provide resources for improving community university partnerships focused on tackling inequalities. Through the network and other activities organised by the NCCPE there is an opportunity to engage a range of non-academic stakeholders, both in the UK and internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>474946</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>David Hopkinson (http://davidhopkinson.org/) worked with Bristol-based Knowle West Media Centre on videotapes held by the British Film Institute of the output of Knowle West TV, the archive of the 1970s Rediffusion local TV service.

Inspired by the National Film Board of Canada's 'Challenge for Change' programme, Bristol Channel adopted a community access approach to programming, aiming to democratise media production but somewhat at odds with the commercial motivation which led Rediffusion, at the time the UK's largest cable company, to launch the service on its Bristol network. (Peter Lewis, 1976, 'Bristol Channel and Community Television, London: Independent Broadcasting Authority). Knowle West TV was developed to test a decentralised media model and some 40 hours of broadcast were produced and transmitted between 1973 and 1975. We're working with people in Knowle West who participated in KWTV or who've lived in the community for long enough to recognise participants and locations. The digitised video will be archived by the City of Bristol and Knowle West Media Centre will bring this material into the community via the University of Local Knowledge. Important place-based information will be registered through the Know Your Place &amp;amp; Map Your Bristol tools in order to involve this community archive in the planning process.

In the first workshop, 10 people attended, with Peter Lewis and with Sharon Irish, a Colston Meaker Fellow visiting Bristol from U Illinois: Urbana-Champagne. The aim of the event was to go through the paper-based tape list held by BFI to identify priority material for digitisation. The results of this workshop then informed the BFI's digitisation process, which was filmed by Calling the Shots production company. http://knowyourbristol.blogs.ilrt.org/event/knowle-west-tv-workshop-1/ The second workshop will take place in November 2014 and the community will work with the digitised material in order to crowdsource place- and person-based meta-data.

There are only 3 1&amp;quot; IVC videoplayer machines left in the UK. 1&amp;quot; IVC tapes have a 30-year shelf life, but the Knowle West TV tapes are 40+ years. We were able to digitise 23 hours of footage successfully. This will impact on the preservation and digitisation approach by the British Film Institute.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5445419d5c87e1.80921234</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://knowyourbristol.blogs.ilrt.org/on-the-move/exploring-co-production/knowle-west-on-the-move/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Family History Day at Single Parent Action Network, 15.3.2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2847CFBD-09AD-4EC3-8171-34C74A03C1D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lively discussion among exhibition visitors.

People in Bristol were invited to share home movies and videos at Knowle West Media Centre and MShed. This was a 'bring-your-own-film' event including a 'film preservation clinic', DiY digitisation training and film screenings. Home movies were welcome in any film format - 8mm, Super 8, 16mm - or video format - VHS, Digi8, miniDV. This was the first event of 2 home movie workshops, the second of which will be a full day event in Knowle West only, designed specifically for residents of Knowle West who will be invited to bring their home videos. Archivists from Bristol Records Office inspect materials in order to assess safe projection. Tips for how to preserve and digitise home movies are shared. These domestic archives and associated metadata will augment the Map your Bristol tool.

For International Home Movie Day, we joined with the US-based Centre for Home Movies and linked in with the international network of hosts. We were interviewed by Bristol's BCFM and BBC Radio Bristol about the event and therefore estimate reaching an audience of 500 or so people.

An MA student has volunteered to work with KWMC and BRO on her dissertation project on home movies. The two heads of competing local history groups in Knowle West shared space. The BRO reported increased interest in public deposition of moving image archives.

Their music teacher told me that one of the students seems to re-think racial stereotypes through encounters of people with a different racial background as him/her. To me this seems like a tremendous impact, even if it only effects that one person, then her change of thinking may have a ripple effect from this. The A level music student have gained more confidence as the head teacher is going to show the school what they have been doing with the software and mapping. They may even be interested in adding a layer and at least mapping their own school.

The third workshop involved a commissioned artist, David Hopkinson, and 6 UG and PGR students from University of Bristol. This week-long event was held at Knowle West Media Centre. The artist and students worked with the Knowle West TV materials to produce re-edits, for exhibition and for uploading to Map your Bristol. Additionally, raw video was viewed by the general public on 10 computer stations, with a view to crowdsourcing metadata. This event attracted 50 visitors to Knowle West Media Centre. The event was also profiled on BBC Radio Bristol's Breakfast Show, with video uploaded on their Facebook page, which attracted a total of over 25,000 views. BBC Points West took up the story on television and interviewed Penny Evans, co-director of Knowle West Media Centre. Local TV channel, Made in Bristol, then took up the story and presented a programme on the material. And David Hopkinson's edits were shown on the Floating Cinema, a national art project based in London, which travels Britain's canals, showing archival film.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d403a91d8a04.77520496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://knowyourbristol.blogs.ilrt.org/on-the-move/exploring-co-production/knowle-west-on-the-move/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bristol Action for Southern Africa AGM talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0156A329-FD7B-4349-A3CC-FCE3C5233FC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk introduced the 'Map Your Bristol' application to the members of Bristol Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA) - it has been a stimulus to further engagement with the organisation and the setting-up of a small working-group to produce an ACTSA/Anti-Apartheid layer for 'Map Your Bristol'.
