We are trying to find ways to encourage repair in individuals that suffer brain or spinal cord injury by studying signalling molecules in nerve cells that are important for axon growth. 

Axon regeneration is actively prevented by a variety of proteins made by surrounding cells. An axon responds to these proteins using receptors on its surface that set off a chain of signals within. Axon behaviour can be radically changed using drugs to alter the activities of these signalling molecules. 

We want to improve our understanding of the functions of one very important signalling molecule, called cyclic AMP, which can enhance axon regeneration when activated. We can study its activity and the functions of proteins that it activates in living rat nerve cells in culture using the most modern cell imaging techniques. We can therefore monitor the events that accompany axon contact with tissues, cells and proteins that they encounter in vivo, as well as the effects of using drugs to alter cyclic AMP activity. We aim to provide information that will lead to new approaches to promoting CNS repair in humans.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Injured axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate, due to a robust inhibitory extracellular environment and developmental changes in the regulation of intrinsic axonal signalling mechanisms. Appropriate manipulation of some signalling molecules can overcome growth cone collapse and repulsion in vitro, and promote some axon regeneration in vivo. However, little is known of the consequences of manipulating key signalling molecules within the growth cone or in the surrounding cells in vivo, because neither the activities of these molecules nor the cellular responses to their manipulation have been adequately quantified. Thus the potential of such a strategy to promote nerve repair remains to be properly investigated. A major focus of this proposal is to image cAMP activity in live growth cones by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), using tissue culture models to test the hypothesis that manipulating growth cone signalling mechanisms could overcome axon growth inhibition. Growth cone behaviour will be studied on contact with CNS glial cells or appropriate molecular boundaries. Specifically, a number of signalling molecules will be modified, including cyclic nucleotides, Ca2+ and members of the Rho family of small GTPases that mediate growth cone extension and collapse. The proposal will also focus on the roles of the cAMP targets PKA and Epac, a guanine exchange factor that is activated by cAMP independently of protein kinase A. Data will be quantitated by immunoreactivity, Western blotting, calcium imaging, FRET and timelapse microscopy. These studies will considerably enhance our knowledge of the signalling mechanisms that underlie a growth cone?s contact with its molecular and cellular environment, and inhibitory barriers specifically. They will also reveal how growth cone signalling changes during development, and what signals might be best targeted to overcome the inhibition of axon regeneration, providing new strategies for promoting CNS repair in vivo.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Rugby Union</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SRU-funded Lecturer in Neuroscience</gtr:description><gtr:id>B82AB927-E9AF-4514-A55A-F0EE2CB2D11B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>iboyJkrAmn5-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Financial support to attract a researcher with in vivo experience with whom to forge potential future collaborations to take the in vitro work supported by the MRC to a new level.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Data from the MRC award &amp;quot;G0500801 Promoting CNS regeneration by targeting cell signalling&amp;quot; formed a major contribution in attracting financial support from the Scottish Rugby Union and the Aberdeen University Development Trust to fund a Neuroscience Lecturer position in the School of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Epac FRET</gtr:description><gtr:id>8E05A9CC-5D92-4C9A-8966-7B948C6600F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Also resulted in prominent publications (PMID 20007468 and PMID 20007468) as described in the PKA FRET collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>0FCDAF6BBC3-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided Epac FRET constructs by material transfer agreement, and approved manuscript for publication</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Carried out all primary research and prepared manuscript for publication</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>PKA FRET</gtr:description><gtr:id>267FD3A4-0960-4C93-A651-0F9757D973B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications (PMID 20007468 and PMID 20851749) reporting alternative downstream signalling via either PKA or Epac that determines repulsive or attractive growth cone turning respectively to axon guidance cues.

It involves transfection of a constructs that encodes a protein expressing two different fluorophores. When the fluorophores are in close proximity, activation of one with a specific wavelength of light leads to energy transfer to the other, which emits light at a separate wavelength that can be detected by computer software. The computer uses a formula to calculate the ratio of excitation and emission wavelengths to measure the amount of energy transfer. When the protein is activated a conformational change results in fluorophores moving closer together or further apart, causing a change in FRET that indicates changes in protein activity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1AE623E7-42BA-4681-92D5-F24965BB99A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method has largely been used in cell lines or non-neuronal cells. Transfection of primary neurons has historically been difficult due to the very low viability. We are one of the very few labs in the world who can successfully perform FRET in primary neurons. The method allows direct measurement of protein activity in live neurons. Thus predicted mechanisms can be tested and confirmed, or novel or unexpected signalling mechanisms may be uncovered. We have found that Epac and PKA distinctly mediate cyclic AMP-depednent neuronal signalling mechanisms that differentially influence axon growth, guidance and regenration. This will impact on the mode of cyclic AMP signalling mechanisms being re-assessed and could lead to novel targets for promoting CNS repair.
