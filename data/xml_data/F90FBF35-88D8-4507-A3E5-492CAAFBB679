&lt;p>For many people the criminal law might appear to be an appropriate tool for punishing and deterring such behaviour. But is this recourse to criminalisation really the most appropriate response in this context?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The use of criminal law to respond to infectious disease transmission has implications for a number of professional and public organisations. It presupposes, for example, that people who infect others can be identified by the police, prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service and effectively and fairly brought to justice in a criminal court applying the law. This process involves a potentially difficult relationship between the organs of criminal justice and public health bodies, whose agendas and priorities may not necessarily coincide.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is to address these concerns that this Seminar Series bring together researchers, healthcare professionals, diseases charities and practitioners concerned with the creation and enforcement of criminal laws on disease transmission, with a view to producing outputs for both academic and non-academic readerships.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this Seminar Series?

Those outside of academic and research institutions who will gain direct benefit from the Seminar Series and the outputs generated by it are a) those bodies and professions to whom our non-academic output (end of project report) is intended to be addressed, and amongst whom it will be primarily presented and disseminated; b) Healthcare professionals involved in treating potential victims or perpetrators of 'transmission crimes' and also independent research bodies, both of which will benefit from the practioner-focused publications printed in the high-impact journal 'Sexually Transmitted Infections' (BMA). In summary then, the direct beneficiaries of the project are:

1. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)

2. The Law Commission (criminal law team)

3. Practioners in sexual healthcare clinics (e.g. the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV, the British HIV Association)

4. Independent research bodies involved in public health work (e.g. SIGMA research)

Those who will derive indirect benefit are those other important organisations and institutions that have been invited to participate in the discussions and to give papers in response to the CPS and Law Commission presentations that will also contribute to the policy-oriented output. The participation of these organisations is integral to the Seminar Series, and although their role in the report is largely one of helping to produce it (through contributing to seminar sessions) rather than consuming it, it is anticipated that they will also derive benefit from the output they helped to create. These beneficiaries include:

1. Charities working with people living with disease and working to reduce crime (e.g. the Terrence Higgins Trust, Positively UK, Herpes Viruses Association, Hep C Trust).

2. If our engagement with the Law Commission and the CPS, in collaboration with other relevant public health and criminal justice professionals leads either to improvements of policy or practise in the CPS, or to proposals for legislative reform published by the Commission, then the beneficiaries will also include people affected by disease and crime. 

How will they benefit from the Seminar Series? 

All the listed beneficiaries will derive benefit, firstly by being able to take advantage of an opportunity to engage in directed discussion with other relevant professionals as well as academic experts, and secondly because the seminars are geared towards producing high-impact outputs: 

a) A policy-oriented end of project report summarizing the extent to which agreement between participants was reached on the effectiveness of current policy, and whether reform is needed. This report is intended to benefit relevant organisations and in this way to have non-academic impact by being disseminated to those organisations that participated, as well as to others. Any recommendations made will relate directly to the work of the CPS and the Law Commission, and the usefulness of the report to all relevant participating organisations will be ensured by its having been produced collaboratively with the assistance of representatives.

b) The Editor-in-Chief of 'Sexually Transmitted Infections' Professor Jackie Cassell has agreed that a number of suitable papers submitted as part of the Seminar Series may be considered for publication in the journal. In November 2011 we will send out a general Call for paper presentations (to fill the available slots in the seminars), chapter contributions to our academic book and also papers for publication in 'Sexually Transmitted Infections').</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15101</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In the course of this seminar series, we identified four key organizations, all of which are involved in one or more of policy engagement, legal reform and clinical practice, which would benefit from our discussions, outputs and findings. These are the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH - an organization made up of professionals working in sexual health), Amnesty International, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Law Commission. We established links with each of these, and with the exception of Amnesty, we had representations from each of them, alongside participants across a range of other relevant organizations and institutions at the seminars. 

We agreed with all four of these organizations that we will send them the end of project report in Nov 2014. In the case of Amnesty and the Law Commission this was particularly timely. For Amnesty, the Law and Policy programme 'Criminalization of Sexuality and Reproduction: exploring limits on state punitive regulation', led by Jaime Todd-Gher, convened an informal expert group. Sending a copy of our report contributed to this group's work in the winter of 2014-15 on the potential of human rights advocacy in responding to criminalization worldwide. The Amnesty project draft outcomes report ('Criminalization of sexuality and reproduction: exploring limits on state punitive regulation') cites our seminar series report. Our contribution assists Amnesty in its efforts to inform and inspire decriminalization advocacy internationally.

The other three users are based within England and Wales. The Law Commission recently conducted a scoping exercise with regard to making recommendations for the reform of criminal laws on non-fatal offences against the person. Our project (and seminar 4 in particular) contributed to that exercise by having a representative from the Law Commission at the final seminar at the time when the Law Commission was preparing its initial scoping paper. They published that paper last year, citing one of our outputs (the book of collected essays edited by co-Investigators Catherine Stanton and Hannah Quirk, pre-publication). The final report ('Reform of Offences Against the Person' LC 361, HC 555) published Nov 2015 quotes and at various points cites a submission made by me (in collaboration with two colleagues at Southampton University, and informed by the ESRC seminar series), as well as the article by Leslie Francis that she presented at seminar 1 of our ESRC series and published in the International Journal of Law in Context (see our list of outputs). The LC also cited my short article in the journal 'Sexually Transmitted Infections' (BMJ) which is also an output for the ESRC project, as an example of academic literature advocating for decriminalization. The report also cited submissions by Catherine Stanton, James Chalmers, Matthew Philips and Matthew Weait, all of whom contributed to the seminar series by presenting their arguments at one or more of the meetings. It is hoped that our contributions will inform a subsequent wider review by the LC on the necessity for legislative reform proposals.

We also sent the report to the CPS and to BASHH to contribute to their own on-going reflections on their crucial work in (respectively) prosecuting cases of disease transmission and advising and treating patients who may be both defendants and complainants in those cases. The report that we have sent to these organisations, as well as other groups and individuals that have participated in the project (namely the HIV Justice Network, the Herpes Viruses Association and the George House Trust) can be found online, e.g. via this link to the Institute of Criminal Justice Research website at the University of Southampton: http://www.southampton.ac.uk/icjr/news/2014/11/25_criminalising_contagion_summary.page?
Of these, the HIV Justice Network has picked up our project report and also the submission I made subsequently to the Law Commission scoping exercise and cite these in 'Advancing HIV Justice' to be published on the HIV Justice website Nov 2015. The Network is a resource for many thousands of people in the UK and beyond living with HIV/AIDS or otherwise active in promoting the interests of relevant persons and civil society groups, and our contribution to their work promotes knowledge and understanding of the changing policy and legal landscape for its many users.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FDFA77C9-BD31-4BC3-A037-799B966A788A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5457a040b93c26.78654469</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This seminar series addressed a series of questions: how should the law treat a person who transmits a serious infection such as HIV, or exposes others to the risk of infection? For example, should such a person be treated as a criminal, in the same way as someone who injures another? This project has brought together experts from a range of disciplines to answer these questions. Some of these experts argued (in the seminars we organised, the related publications we edited, or both) that measures such as detention and criminal sanction are indeed appropriate and proportionate tools for preventing or punishing serious harms. Others argued to the contrary that severe public health measures or criminalisation are not an appropriate response in this context, and for a number of complex reasons. In this seminar series, we have tried to highlight and explore some of the most pressing implications that the deprivation of a person's liberty in the response to infectious disease transmission has for a number of professional and public organisations. 
The papers presented in the course of this seminar series have led us to at least two broad conclusions: 1) that there is a rich diversity of ways both for law to approach the problem of infection and its spread, and 2) that this is a topic that engages a number of different interested groups and discussion that can be both rich and also polarizing. While we did not identify any one view on criminalisation, we heard and read both strong criticism of the use of criminal sanctions in this context, as well as defences of criminal sanctions in some circumstances.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We see five primary ways in which our findings might be taken forward. Firstly in terms of academic routes, given that the project provided an opportunity for advocates of different and divergent legal and ethical positions to be heard together, our findings will be useful for scholars pursuing academic research in this area. Secondly, the findings will be useful for human rights advocacy groups such as Amnesty International and the HIV Justice Network in their current efforts to use scholarly research and professional experience to address what they regard as overzealous and stigmatising uses of criminalisation of sexual and intimate behaviours around the world. Thirdly, the findings will be useful for organisations and bodies in the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales such as the Law Commission whose responsibility it is to draw up proposals for law reform. Fourthly, lawyers who are involved in the prosecution and defence of cases of disease transmission in the criminal courts will be able to use these findings to inform their work. In particular, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would find our findings useful in developing and reflecting on their prosecutorial policies. Fifthly, diseases charities and sexual health clinicians will benefit from making use of our findings in informing the advice they give to their own service-users.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3DDBBAB0-19AD-404E-9C4E-BACDFFE94B8A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54579ef5607b80.00796174</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government,
