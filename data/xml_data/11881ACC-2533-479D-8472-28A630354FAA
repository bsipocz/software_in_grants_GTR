The Rewind project is a research project (2004-ongoing), that is providing a research resource to address the gap in historical knowledge of the evolution of electronic media arts in the UK, by investigating specifically the first two decades of artists' works in video. It has partaken in innovative and creative engagements with new audiences and user communities which stimulate pathways to impact. The project has successfully preserved and archived over 400 works by artists' from this period and hosts an online database containing information and ephemera on each work.

The original Telly Pieces project was a companion project to a series of artists works commissioned for Channel 4. These works, collectively titled 'Television Interventions' were commissioned for presentation in 1990 at the end of the period covered by the Rewind research project and featured many of the artists who appear in the Rewind archive. The Telly Pieces aspect of the project involved nearly 300 young people from the Strathclyde area working to produce 8 x 4 minute video art works which were featured in exhibitions and festivals internationally. One of the projects was also developed to appear on television alongside the other Television Interruptions.

The Rewind research profiled the work of artists exploring a new medium at a time when their practice was extremely innovative and experimental and we now wish to recapture some of the significance of this practice and its creative methods through a series of projects with young people in the City of Dundee. Working with Dundee Contemporary Arts (a large building-based arts centre in the city) - we will introduce the work of these artists through a series of workshops using the Rewind archive which will be aimed at bridging the contemporary and historical approaches to media arts. These workshops will build towards the creation of a body of new works that will echo the experimentation embedded in the methods of these earlier artists. Focused on developing a creative attitude towards new technology that echoes the work of these earlier artists, they will use the concept of creative innovation through technology that is both a creative and ideological action. 

Knowledge exchange and engagement will be facilitated through working with the DCA's skilled education team who are very experienced in working with a wide variety of people, introducing complex and sophisticated cultural ideas to diverse audiences. The contemporary context will be brought to the project through a foregrounding of the lives of these young people, their technologies and their critiques of the cultural world around them. Works will be created that will echo the personal, political and formal considerations of the earlier work and these will be exhibited in and around the DCA building in its cinemas, exhibition spaces, active on-line spaces and broadcast by BBC Four. They will also be available to view online.

Participants will be drawn from the wide user base that already engage with DCA, both through individual relationships as well as organisational connections. DCA has a team of Young Ambassadors - young people who make active programming decisions and provide context and critique to the DCA programme. DCA also has well-established links with many local schools, youth organisations and community centres - many engaging actively with the annual Discovery Film Festival - Scotland's International Film Festival for Young Audiences that takes place at DCA.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this research are the young people who will learn film production for cinema and television and working under the challenge of a creative brief. Their teachers, family and peer groups will be attracted to the exhibition and screenings, and it is likely that there will be considerable interest from the City, region and Scotland.

The participants will be drawn from the local community and from third sector organisations in the City and the surrounding area. Through the co-designing and co-creating sessions with more established artists and technicians, we seek to empower them as makers and as creative individuals. 

DCA as the third sector partner will extend the reputation and reach of its education activity and will benefit from the portfolio of finished works for exhibition and reputational gain by the broadcasts on BBC FOUR. 

BBC FOUR as the commercial partner will gain from the support and transmission of the finished works to the general public. The transmissions will extend the reach to the UK as a whole

The REWIND 'brand' is now established as a significant resource for Scholars, artists, curators creative industry organisations and the general public. The REWIND website (rewind.ac.uk) has been a huge success with 2M visitors from 119 countries since the launch in 2006. Over 40,000 files have been downloaded (which is the most significant index - as these files are not downloaded by a casual visitor being on average 1 hour of material for study). The REWIND Facebook page has extended the reach and in itself offers a new resource for people interested in avant-garde film and video with over 1000 visitors per week, 45% female and 35 % in the 15-25 age group. The TV21 project will further extend the reputation and awareness of REWIND.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24134</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My experimental film piece shows the moments between the hectic schedules we follow on a day to day basis. It begins with Thomas, dressed in a simple white shirt and black trousers, who walks into a blank, white room. These clips are referred to as scenario #1, are in black and white and are in slow motion. This clip lasts for approximately 15 seconds however is swiftly interrupted by scenario #2 - clips filmed in Dundee city at night showing busyness, lights, colour, loud traffic and people too absorbed in what they are doing to notice themselves breathing, blinking, acknowledging time. In contrast there is another clip of Thomas, completely aware of himself and his surroundings. As this sequence continues, Thomas progressively gets frustrated as the scenario #2 clips intensify, get louder and more uncomfortable. 
My inspiration came from David Hall's TV Interruptions. I liked the idea of having something unexpected capturing the audience's attention. Another clip that had a lasting impression on me was Drift Guitars by Tony Sinden, I liked the simplicity of the scene and it was what inspired me to make scenario #1 black and white.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A92E9442-50AE-409F-A2D3-376D3FFC8744</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TV work by a young person derived from REWIND Collection and Archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c7156cb3db04.56468164</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Dissimilitute by Tara Glenn</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/117401793</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My project was inspired partly by the scratch videos of the Duvet brothers.
The video is intended be abstract and visually interesting rather than having a strong narrative or any type of rigid structure. The main idea came from the colour and intensity of the scratch video.
I was interested in trying to contrast all the colour with something monochrome and seeing what effect it had. The idea then kind of developed into something else as I tried to edit it in a way that the flashes of colour represent the gaps in our understanding as we are slowly going inside the mind of the character where anything is possible. I deliberately tried to keep the video abstract in the hope that everyone will take something different from it. It was my intention that the colours will represent different things to different people.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E27852A-1088-49E2-ACCB-D6686BEDE7BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TV work by a young person derived from REWIND Collection and Archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c7178aee18e4.28516315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>What We Don't See by Ali Olivier</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/117407462</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My short film focuses on a character walking through a town centre. He is casually strolling through a street when a light coming from an alleyway catches his eye. The character looks down the alleyway and sees that at the end of the cobbled road there is a glowing light leading to a forest area. He does a double take before entering this alleyway and is slowly drawn into the forest area. He slowly walks through his new surroundings, trying to make sense of where he is. He receives a text message and while he is reading the message there is a huge noise and he is forcibly thrown back onto the street in the town centre. Bemused and bewildered he looks around and decides to go back into the alleyway only to discover the forest area is gone and it is just an average alleyway. The character, extremely dazed and confused, leaves the alleyway and continues down the street, wondering what has just happened to him.
My inspiration for this film came from a photo of a skateboarder called Nick Jensen from Grey magazine, a London based skate magazine, who was doing a grind trick on a ledge that was in front of an electricity box. On the other side of the electricity box were three girls who seemed to be going on a night out. The assumption from the photo is that once the skateboarder had landed his trick he might crash into the three girls. From this photo I then got my title for my film, 'You never know what's around the corner', and brainstormed ideas until I felt I had the right one.
Whilst editing my film I came across an quote which adds to the idea of my film -&amp;quot;You never know what's around the corner. It could be everything. Or it could be nothing. You keep putting one foot in front of the other, and then one day you look back and you've climbed a mountain.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>8C3871C7-7AE7-4C62-A964-0DB876184B53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TV work by a young person derived from REWIND Collection and Archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c714a95baf15.22599258</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>You Never Know What's Around The Corner by Sam O'Hare</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/117402583</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A white room slowly begins to be filled loads of black bin bags filled with balloons. A girl spots the balloons and begins to free them from the bags. Her joy and enchantment of the balloons is disrupted by the sudden arrival of other young people who run around trying to burst all of the balloons. The girl starts to panic and gets really confused. No one notices that there's something wrong and eventually she falls into all the balloons and disappears under the pile of them. The group stop their frenzied activity only when they find what they were searching for. They leave as quickly as they came and the girl is left lying there, unnoticed.
A kind of message I want to portray is the idea that everyone is self-absorbed and not noticing or helping people that are suffering all around them. There is too much distraction for them to notice. Also that distractions and excuses for not noticing people suffering are kind of trivial and quite sad</gtr:description><gtr:id>7C5E430F-1CFF-4067-9999-93ED7F3F7067</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TV work by a young person derived from REWIND Collection and Archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c716f5b3cc73.37801112</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Pop! by Catriona Strachan</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/117273377</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In this piece you see the transformation of a girl as she becomes more and more depressed. This is shown through still images and short shots that represent a record that she takes of herself throughout this time. We see her go from a happy, light-hearted person to someone that seems lifeless and empty. For me this was inspired by my friend and watching her go through it and also the desire to show a slightly different representation of depression that is maybe not very realistic but conveys the hopelessness of it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D593103D-47A2-4F8F-958D-8D3F1298705F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TV work by a young person derived from REWIND Collection and Archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c7162e5716a5.14249498</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Day To Day by Heather Horsman</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/117401794</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Project provided training in TV production for a group of young people.
