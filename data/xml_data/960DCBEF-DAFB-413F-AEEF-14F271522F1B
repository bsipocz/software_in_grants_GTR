Both frequently injure large tendons in their legs that function as 'biological springs' to save muscular effort by stretching and storing energy when the leg bears weight, then rebounding to propel the athlete forward. In people the Achilles tendon (AT) has this function, while in horses it is the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT). As more people participate in sports to improve their health and maintain mobility during ageing, more AT injuries are occurring. In Scotland the incidence has increased by 90% over the last 15 years, now comprising &amp;gt;10% of soft tissue injuries. Up to 30% of racehorses suffer similar problems. Tendons heal slowly with scar tissue and never regain their original strength. Such injuries interrupted the international careers of David Beckham and Kelly Holmes, and those of many well-known racehorses including Kicking King, the 2005 Cheltenham Cup winner. Tendon injuries follow an undefined period of accumulation of painless damage to their substance (matrix) during exercise. Tendon cells, called tenocytes, do not repair this 'microdamage' and may be killed, begin to produce the wrong type of collagen, and/or degrade the surrounding matrix, causing a vicious injury cycle. Research over many years has suggested that this degeneration represents acceleration of a normally age-related process. Slowing or preventing this would have a greater impact on preventing injuries, and so improving performance and welfare of athletes than attempting treatment. We think a major factor causing tenocyte injury is high temperature. As tendons stretch and contract, some stored energy is lost as heat that cannot be easily dissipated. The SDFT core reaches at least 45oC during galloping, from its normal temperature of 37-38oC. As the AT functions in a similar way, hyperthermia is also highly likely to occur in its core. In the laboratory, most tenocytes die after 10 min at 45oC, but interestingly this involves transmission of 'death signals' between cells through gap junctions (GJ). GJ are small pores directly connecting neighbouring cells into networks. When GJ are chemically blocked following heating much of the tenocyte death and upregulation of less effective matrix proteins can be prevented. This is exciting, as GJ can be manipulated. We will use cells and tissue from SDFTs to determine when, relative to heating, the tenocytes 'decide' to die or alter their activity. We will measure an array of biomarkers to identify points at which we might reverse these changes e.g. do we need to do something within minutes or hours? Secondly we will explore a drug-free method of intervention: cooling of tendons after exercise e.g. using ice baths is often used as an 'injury prevention' measure. Cooling can close GJ in other cell types, which could prevent spread of death signals during critical post-exercise periods. Mild hypothermia (i.e. 32oC) may also upregulate 'cold-stress proteins' that protect cells. We aim to understand when, for how long, at what levels and how many times temperature differentials should be applied by athletes to reduce tendon microdamage. In the final part of this project we will look at one of the major proteins making up the GJ, called connexin 43 (Cx43). We will investigate methods of targeting the Cx43 molecule i.e. preventing it from being made within tenocytes. This will allow us to better understand how GJ influence cell death/damage following heat shock, but may also facilitate development of drugs to regulate it that could be delivered locally e.g. in gels or ointments. With the upcoming London Olympic Games and Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the likelihood that increasing numbers of people will be inspired to participate in athletic activity, this is a timely opportunity to develop methods of preventing injuries while also improving the welfare of horses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The methodologies needed to fulfil our objectives are detailed beneath the objectives: 1. Mechanism: to determine hyperthermic injury thresholds that damage gap junction (GJ)-linked tendon fibroblast (tenocyte) networks in energy-storing tendons. 2. Prevention: to engineer a drug-free adaptive response by tenocytes to heat shock that can be easily adopted by athletes i.e. application of temperature differentials. 3. Therapy: to validate the GJ component Cx43 as a molecular target for protection of energy-storing tendons from cumulative stress-induced microdamage. Methodology: Objectives 1 and 2 require a heating and cooling apparatus and use of cyto/histo chemical analyses or biochemical techniques that are routinely used in the laboratory. Rapid heating will be achieved using a controllable peltier system with integrated thermocouple (WATronix). Longer incubations at low temperature will be with a gas-perfused humidified incubator to better preserve cell viability. Objective 3 requires us to genetically manipulate tenocytes. We will use antisense oligodeoxynucleotide technology with which our collaborator, Prof David Becker, is expert. MicroRNA silencing of Cx43 will be by transfection of a microRNA precursor, which is processed to form the small RNA that interferes with Cx43 translation. pSilencer-mir-206 (Ambion) will be used to express our microRNA; the vector is called pSilencer as it is also has siRNA applications. Transfection will be with TransIT-1 (Mirus) which is non toxic and effective in transfecting primary equine fibroblasts. In-vitro models: Primary tenocytes will be cultured at 2% O2 (~the oxygen tension in the tendon), on matrix-coated surfaces including micro-thin tendon tissue as a base material, with the inclusion of agonists to stimulate 'stretch' pathways (developed by TR/JPK). A tissue explant model; tendon strips will be adapted to culture conditions for 18h, then cultured at the liquid air interface (developed by JD).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Athletes Beneficiaries: Elite and recreational athletes, trainers, coaches, physiotherapists, UK Sport, Sport England, The Institute of Sport and Recreation Management, Sports Coach UK.

As it is difficult to measure the actual changes in the tissue in live animals we have developed a method that uses pieces of tendon tissue (obtained from waste material from post-mortem rooms or abattoir. This allows us to measure the changes that occur in tendon cells due to high temperatures.

Exposure of the tendon to hyperthermia, to mimic repetitive exercise, induces proteins in the tendon cells that are involved in an abnormal stress response (destructive) as well as responses that are protective to the damaging effects of high temperature. However, the protective mechanisms are not sufficient to counter the traumatic effect of hyperthermia both at the cell and extracellular matrix levels. When the tendons are exposed to hyperthermia immediately followed by a short period of cooling to 10 0C (hypothermia) the protective mechanism was sufficient to dampen the hyperthermia-induced stress response. Tendon cells can transmit distress signal from one to another which can exacerbates the hyperthermia-induced stress signals. Our work has demonstrated that when the cooling phase is applied after hyperthermia the ability of the cells to communicate is dampened. Thus, post-exercise cooling can reduce both the damaging stress signals within cells and their transfer to other cells. This suggests that a short cooling period at a specific temperature could be beneficial in prevention of hyperthermia-induced damage to tendons after intense exercise.

Although chilling of tendons in athletes after an injury is often used, our work provides a rationale for cooling temperature and period after exercise to prevent onset of injury. Optimisation of the hypothermic treatment may provide further insight into management of exercise-induced injuries to tendons. It may also be possible to develop small molecule drugs for topical application (e.g. over the Achilles) to mimic hypothermia to inhibit cell-to-cell communication of stress signals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings so far has led us to investigate drugs that block cell-to-cell communications (via GAP junctions) and by rapid cooling of the tendon to a specific temperature after hyperthermia.
