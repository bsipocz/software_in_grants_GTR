By the time the disease is detected in an individual because of loss of function (whether cognitive or physical), extensive degeneration has in many instances already taken place. Reversing this degeneration presents an enormous challenge; the goal of this project is instead to focus on understanding factors that contribute to causing the degeneration, and to find ways of identifying the degeneration at an early stage in order to i) improve detection, and ii) offer new targets for effective treatment. 

A common theme linking many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Motor Neurone Disease, and Multiple System Atrophy, is that changes in the regulation of certain trace metals, and/or the proteins responsible for binding and utilizing these metal elements, are apparent. This can include accumulation of certain elements, such as iron, in specific regions of the brain. Our hypothesis is that these changes are disease-specific, and if better understood, may provide windows of opportunity for improved detection and treatment.

Limiting factors affecting present work in this area include:
i) the challenge of extrapolating findings from simple experiments in the laboratory to the complexity of the biochemical environment in the brain;
ii) the challenge of accurate sensitive detection of trace metal elements in the brain - both for measurement in the living brain using clinical techniques, and for laboratory analysis of brain tissue. 

In the proposed research, a combination of experiments and computer-based modelling will be undertaken, in order to describe, predict, and test mechanisms of trace metal regulation that are anticipated to be affected in some of these neurodegenerative disorders. The models will be constructed using what is already known from experimental work, including published data from other research groups. In turn, as predictions are made by the models developed in this project, experiments will be designed and performed to test the predictions and update the models accordingly.

Experiments to look at the interactions between metal-binding proteins and the trace metals that affect their aggregation, will be made more physiologically relevant by studying them in purpose-designed 'microfluidic' systems: experimental systems engineered to enable work with extremely small volumes (micro- or nanolitres) of sample. Microfluidic systems have three particular advantages in this context: i) they allow much smaller amounts of sample to be studied than would normally be the case, ii) they permit high-throughput testing of many experimental conditions for a single batch of protein which improves efficiency and reduces ambiguity in the results, and iii) the very small volumes and control of interfaces that can be achieved make it possible to mimic physiological conditions more accurately than has previously been possible.

Very sensitive analysis of trace metals in tissues will be achieved in experiments using UK synchrotron facilities. These provide extremely bright beams of X-rays that can be focussed to micron or sub-micron diameters for mapping. The beams excite natural fluorescence signal from specific elements such as iron, copper, and zinc, enabling patterns of deposition to be mapped for each element even for trace concentrations of just a few parts per million. 

It is anticipated that the specific questions addressed in this project will help further our understanding of how iron affects the aggregation of a particular protein found in Lewy body pathology in Parkinson's disease, and will also enable progress in understanding how (and where) brain iron storage is affected in certain neurodegenerative disorders, to assess if there are sufficient differences for these diseases to be detected, and distinguished from each other, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of metal-ion-based neurodegeneration. It is anticipated that the research will affect clinical tools for detection and improved differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease on a 5 - 10 year timescale; in the shorter term there is scope for the research to affect drug development strategies for mediating metal-ion-based neurotoxicity. There is a pressing need for both: we do not presently have effective treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and specific diagnosis of prevalent forms of neurodegeneration remains extremely difficult; diagnosis is often only confirmed at autopsy. The two challenges are interlinked, as without clear means to accurately identify patients in the early stages of a neurodegenerative disease, there is a limit on the effectiveness of the clinical trials that can be undertaken to develop appropriate therapies. 

Research into the role of metal ions in neurodegenerative disorders is often limited to descriptive observations and speculative conclusions. While interactions and mechanisms may be robustly tested in-vitro, their relevance to in-vivo conditions can be hard to establish. Combining quantitative and systems approaches to this field provides great scope to establish and test models of metal-based neurodegeneration, where model development will be informed, tested, and refined with experimental data on an iterative basis.

The project will have significant impact on biomedical engineering research capacity at the host institution (University of Warwick), increasing the scope of the experimental and systems projects that can be undertaken at postgraduate, postdoctoral, and inter-departmental level. It will also provide the foundations for joint projects involving colleagues from other institutions, including other universities in the Midlands, and from the healthcare sector including University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire. Internationally, the work will provide opportunities to reinforce and expand collaborations with colleagues in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia. 

The public engagement element of the project will contribute to social awareness of biomedical engineering as a discipline, to an understanding of how the UK large facilities can be used to advance healthcare-related research, and to awareness of the significant unmet challenges in the field of neurodegenerative disease. 

Dissemination of the research findings via peer reviewed journals and conference presentations, and via publications with broader impact such as the Chemistry and Industry article authored by the PI in 2010, and the Nature Outlooks article featuring the PI's research, also in 2010. These forms of dissemination are important for reaching professionals from many sectors in addition to academic specialists in the field. 

The medical technology sector, encompassing work in both diagnostics and therapeutics, is experiencing strong growth both in the UK, and worldwide, compared to the majority of other industry sectors. Demographic shifts in many countries throughout the world are leading to an increased proportion of older people, and therefore the proportion of the population developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The growth in the highly innovative medical technology sector is important for the UK economy, incorporating approximately 4,000 companies, over 90,000 employees, and turnover approaching &amp;pound;20bn, according to UK government (BIS) statistics from December 2010. Research enabling progress in this sector is therefore timely, and stands to benefit the economic development of the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>LGC Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Metallomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>E3430500-AF95-4650-A782-E43E63F1EC33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic partner on LGC-led European metrology consortium bid in 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9922d4a84e2.48452540-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Quantitative analysis of metals in tissues via LA-ICP-MS, method development</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Semi-quantitative analysis of metals in tissues via synchrotron X-ray methods and MRI</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science up close - July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92A12819-1938-41C6-8A95-B598F13F82F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science up close - July 2015

On Wednesday 8 July 2015, the Harwell Campus opened its doors to schools, and on Saturday 11 July to the public, so that they could have a peek behind the scenes at some of the World's most spectacular and powerful science facilities. 16,000 fans of Science visited the Campus on its first Open Day in over a decade. 

On both days, visitors were able to tour the STFC Central Laser Facility to see its Vulcan laser, which produces a beam so intense that it is like taking all of the sunlight shining on the Earth at any one moment and focusing it onto a pin head; the Diamond Light Source (the iconic silver ring that works like a giant microscope and produces light 10 billion times brighter than the sun); RAL Space which designs, builds and tests instruments that will be launched into space, including hi-definition cameras that are now operational on the International Space Station and the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source which is used for a huge variety of science, from designing new medicines to testing materials used in aircraft.
Visitors also had an opportunity to take a 'selfie' with a gigantic cast of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur skeleton in the Diamond Light Source atrium, and star in a Matrix-style 'frozen time' film sequence. Doors opened at 9:30 and the initial rush of visitors saw over 1,000 people on site in the first 30 minutes, all keen to see as much as possible. When the site finally closed at 6pm, a staggering 16,000 people had been through the doors of Harwell.

Our team (a joint exhibition by Joanna Collingwood's group at University of Warwick, and Neil Telling's group from Keele University) presented a stand hosted in the Diamond Light Source atrium, welcoming over 4000 visitors over two days (8th and 11th July 2015). The exhibit was designed to engage school-age visitors and the general public, and we included leaflets (from the School of Engineering at Warwick) encouraging girls to study STEM subjects through our work under the Athena SWAN Bronze Award, as well as explaining how we use synchrotron light to investigate metals in the human brain, and how we're using this to advance understanding of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The interactions resulted in invitations to visit schools in our area of the West Midlands, as well as a formal invitation to Joanna to speak to a local group in Didcot about the research (scheduled for May 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6de33bb89c0.10758751</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://harwellcampus.com/come-to-harwell/open-days/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford Times article 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>384CB2DD-77B0-4E8E-A899-35D1287EE4CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Newspaper feature in the Oxford Times, by Richard O.

In turn, as predictions are made by the models developed in this project, experiments are being designed and performed to test the predictions and update the models accordingly. We developed an initial model in collaboration with Dr Mitchell (UCLA), and findings have been presented at the Movement Disorders Congress in Berlin 2016, are accepted for presentation at the International BioIron meeting in Los Angeles in 2017, and are being submitted to peer review The experimental and computational work undertaken in the initial grant period enabled leverage of subsequent funding for two PhD students (one computational, one experimental) who are continuing the work beyond the award period; additionally the experimental results (published in a series of peer-reviewed papers) contributed to securing synchrotron facility time in the USA and UK, and to securing project grant funding to continue the experimental arm of the project with colleagues at Keele and Warwick. 

The most significant observation in the computational modelling was the extent to which the blood brain barrier can protect against excessive iron uptake into the brain, and the success with which experimentally-observed iron trafficking can be replicated with this computer model. It paves the way to explore a range of scenarios where brain iron metabolism is disrupted, and also to explore ways to 'rescue' or correct disruption to restore healthy conditions in the tissue. 

The most significant observation in the experimental work was the chemical reduction of iron in the presence of a peptide which forms insoluble deposits in neurodegenerative disorders. The chemical reduction of the iron may account for toxicity observed in many systems in association with the peptide aggregation. Subsequent project grant funding has been obtained to explore the underlying mechanisms in more detail.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In addition to the observations noted above it is anticipated that the technique development and protocol refinement emerging from this grant has potential for use in metallomics research by academic researchers from a variety of disciplines, and by research facility providers and specialist areas in industry. Key outputs from the grant include an invited contribution in Springer Neuromethods on 'X-ray microscopy for detection of metals in the brain', and a tutorial review in this topic area in Spectrochimica Acta B, both published in 2017.

Initial evidence is that the computational modelling work will support a number of new collaborations, and will also provide an opportunity for early career researchers who move into this field (including applicants attracted to the Trace Metals in Medicine group at Warwick). We have also been invited to share findings with the PD Map systems biology project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31036EB5-D006-4887-91BC-6B6BBF134342</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546e7834a500d8.93319385</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/staff/jfc/tracemetalslab</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Compartmental mechanistic model of brain iron trafficking</gtr:description><gtr:id>5FFE3C8A-DFE3-4E58-AA06-28047EDB0FAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This model has been presented at the Movement Disorders Congress in Berlin, 2016, and is being prepared for publication.
