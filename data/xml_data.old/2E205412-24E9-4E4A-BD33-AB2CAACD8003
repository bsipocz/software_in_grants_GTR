Teachers are currently paid according to centrally-negotiated pay scales, with higher pay scales in the London area. However, since such weighting applies to particular areas, teacher salaries can vary substantially across boundaries.The cost of living is likely to be very similar in areas close to such local authority boundaries, creating sharp geographical variation in real teacher pay levels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will examine whether such differences in teacher salaries lead to differences in the recruitment and retention of teachers. This will allow us to say whether monetary incentives are likely to be an effective tool in attracting and keeping high-quality teachers. Furthermore, although schools in the London area must pay teachers higher salaries to reflect a higher cost of living, these differences are not always fully reflected in funding differences across local authorities. Such situations create potentially sharp variations in resources available to schools in neighbouring local authorities. This research will exploit such situations to estimate the effects of resources on attainment.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 

Our research will examine whether extra resources can improve educational attainment, and the extent to which pecuniary rewards can be used to attract high-quality teachers. Given the creation of the disadvantaged pupil premium and the new government's focus on recruiting high-quality teachers, the results are likely to be of considerable interest to current education policymakers. Our results will thus also be of interest to academics working in these fields, both in the UK and beyond, and to members of the public keen to engage with the debate. We are likely to be able to predict the extent to which the pupil premium may narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor. We will also be able to provide high-quality evidence on the most effective strategies to recruiting high-quality teachers. Strong positive effects of pecuniary rewards would suggest that policymakers should focus upon teacher pay, whilst an absence of such an effect would suggest a focus on other factors such as the teaching environment. 

Furthermore, our research findings will inform the development of a national funding formula and how schools could improve value-for-money in an era of tight budgets. The results are thus also likely to be of strong interest to education professionals. 

How will we ensure they benefit?

This is a diverse set of potential beneficiaries. However, IFS has a consistent and strong track record in effective engagement with such audiences and we have used this experience and knowledge to construct a dissemination plan targeted at all of these groups. 

We will hold a launch event to publicise the main policy implications of our research findings inviting all individuals on the IFS database, which includes over 2,500 individuals and several hundred public policy figures. We will produce a policy briefing explicitly detailing the implications of our findings, which will be concise, written in plain English and freely available on the IFS website. We will also produce an IFS 'press' release, which would go to interested journalists, as well as other interested parties, such as public, private and third sector organisations. This will further allow us to disseminate the findings via the print and broadcast media. Over the last year, there was an average of 600 references to IFS research in online and print media per month. 

We will also exploit personal contacts to publicise the research findings to key policy advisors, civil servants and politicians, such as members of the Education Select Committee, who Sibieta has previously advised on education and school spending.

We will then further publicise our findings via online tools such as the IFS observations page and the IFS twitter account. These can be used as effective tools for influencing public debate at key moments, e.g. two IFS observations were recently the subject of online news articles on the Department for Education's website, including one explicitly related to school funding. 

We will present the research findings at key conferences and seminars, targeting both policymakers, education professionals. For instance, in the past year Sibieta has presented research on school funding to groups such as the New Schools Network, Westminster Education Forum and Inside Government (all attended by a diverse range of policymakers and education professionals). We also plan to publicise our findings at academic conferences in the UK an beyond, particularly if they attended by non-academics, such as the Royal Economic Society conference. 

To reach a wider academic audience we will ensure that our research papers, when published in working paper format, are widely disseminated. The IFS has a well-established working paper series and an easily-navigable web-site from which such papers can be freely downloaded. Last year, the IFS web page received an average of just over 100,000 visits a month.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79322</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Effect of teacher pay on pupil attainment: a regression discontinuity design (IoE Seminar)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB5DE11D-1CB9-4C37-B6E3-5C055BE61820</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work in progress seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4227872150.23103332ab8d19c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Constrained optimisation?

The feedback from these two seminars helped our investigation of the large difference in observable characteristics across some of the pay boundaries. It also cemented our focus on the difference in inside wages across schools. We have also sought to discuss and compare these findings with academics working on related issues (e.g. Gibbons et al, 2012; and Britton and Propper, 2012). 

Our main findings are detailed in a draft working paper that has been uploaded to ROS. We have chosen not to publish our findings to date due to methodological concerns resulting from the non-comparability of schools at the inner London boundary. We plan to publish this working paper in September 2013, alongside a non-technical briefing note. This will allow us to include analysis of the inside wage differential once access to the School Workforce Census has been granted. The start of a new academic year (with changes to teacher pay and conditions) will be an ideal time to publicise our findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09B467C6-A8C2-4A88-BA85-D3E7C717E4EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54536699e23576.90463233</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We investigate whether pupils' attainment in school is affected by higher teacher salaries and extra resources at their school. Previous research has found it difficult to address these policy-relevant questions because there are few circumstances in which teacher salaries and resources vary in ways unrelated to teacher or pupil characteristics. 

We overcome this challenge by exploiting the fact that teachers in England are paid according to centrally-negotiated pay scales, with higher pay scales in the London area to compensate teachers for a higher cost of living. At the boundary between higher and lower pay areas, teacher salaries can vary substantially, across otherwise identical neighbouring areas. These pay discontinuities can impact pupil attainment if higher salaries attract more effective teachers, or if existing teachers are induced to work harder. Moreover, in some cases, funding differences are overly generous relative to the salary difference, creating an artificial boost in school resources. 

We find no evidence that higher teacher salaries improve pupil attainment. This has important consequences for the design of teacher pay policy. However, there is a significant positive impact on pupil attainment across a teacher pay boundary only where additional funding received by schools permits additional school resources. This suggests that higher levels of school resources can have modest impacts on pupil attainment, in line with recent evidence from the UK. These findings also give cause for optimism about the potential impacts of the pupil premium.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In order to understand the mechanisms driving our findings, we plan to make use of newly available data on employees within schools (School Workforce Census). This will allow us to examine whether schools respond to these discontinuities by changing their pay policies. Secondly, we will be able to relate the (lack of) difference in attainment to actual differences in inside wages across schools. This has not been addressed at all in existing research. We have been formally granted access to use this data. However, this was only after a significant delay in approval by the Department for Education and delivery of the data continues to be delayed. 

Our work has also enabled to us to present and interact with important groups of education policymakers. For instance, Sibieta presented analysis of future plans for school funding reform at the Westminster Education Forum in September 2013 (see ROS). Sibieta spoke at a Royal Statistical Society event at the Houses of Parliament in December 2013 about using data to provide insight into education policy. We also participated in a workshop about the large improvements in attainment in London over the past 5-10 years. Our work comparing the characteristics and outcomes at schools across London was invaluable in allowing us to contribute to discussions on this topic with policymakers. 

This grant has also allowed us to develop wider expertise on teacher pay and conditions. This has enabled us to successfully apply for further funding to study the costs and benefits of different teacher training routes (PI: Ellen Greaves) and the changing fortunes of the public sector workforce more generally (PI: Luke Sibieta).
