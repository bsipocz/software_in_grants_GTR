A key argument in favour of these televised events was that they could reach a wider audience than is usual for politically-related content and that, after watching them, normally apolitical debate-watchers might be better informed about election issues; more likely to discuss policies with their friends and families; and more likely to vote than those who are not exposed to the debates. In short, televised election debates perform a heuristic function, providing voters with resources that enable them to carry out their normative role as informed and reflective citizens of a representative democracy. Research conducted by Coleman et al (&amp;quot;Leaders in the Living Room--The Prime Ministerial Debates of 2010&amp;quot;, Oxford: Reuters Institute, 2011) after the 2010 UK debates showed that there was a significant public appetite for this means of learning about the candidates and their policies, but that many viewers were left feeling uncertain about the meaning of what they had witnessed. This prompted a group of scholars from different disciplines - information science, political communication and design - to get together with a view to exploring how future televised leaders' debates might be made more comprehensible to groups of viewers with specific information needs.

In considering the best approach to presenting complex arguments to citizens with a view to generating better informed public debate about political issues, we have turned to the field of Computer-Supported Argumentation Visualisation (CSAV) which has a track record of utilising innovative information techniques to present complex arguments that citizens can make sense of and reflect upon in the course of policy deliberations.

Our aim in this research is to develop an open-source web-based platform that incorporates a suite of visualisation tools and to develop a working model of how this platform can be embedded within a mixed-media ecology for covering and responding to issues of public political debate. The platform will be designed with a view to i) responding to the information needs of audiences and specific types of audience member; ii) presenting the discursive content in ways that take account of the aesthetic and symbolic needs of information seekers; and iii) not only visualising the debaters' arguments by adopting innovative CSAV methods, but also visualising other features of the debates through the use of non-CSAV-specific techniques, such as word-cloud visualisations (where key words and phrases used in a debate are extracted and visualised such that graphical features like font-size, colour, and positioning are used to depict most import words and phrases) and time-series analyses (where the emphasis is on visualising the chronology of the various speech acts during the debate, so that the context &amp;quot;in time&amp;quot; of key rhetorical events can be captured).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?

Our project will seek to maximise its economic and societal impact through engagement with a range of key stakeholders including journalists and media companies, policy-makers and political organisations, and citizens themselves. Specifically, the project is designed to have a direct impact on citizenship and public access to politics through the development of a new software application that will help users to understand and evaluate election debates.

Our research is also expected to have a broader impact on knowledge and the academy by introducing an innovative new cross-disciplinary technique and methodology to the field of computer-supported argument visualisation and to the areas of e-participation, e-governance, and political communications. By working closely with relevant organisations in the media and politics as well as with academic audiences, we hope to maximise the chances of our research being adopted, applied, and developed more widely in future.

How will they benefit?

Starting with citizens, the main impact of our research will be an improvement in the quality of civic life due to them being able to better understand and evaluate political discourse. This will ideally lead to citizens being able to more directly connect to the political communications process and consequently being better able to influence policy at local and national levels.

In addition to citizens, the research will have an impact on journalists and media companies by introducing them to a proof of concept of new products and services that they can provide in their role as mediators of public political discourse. The research will also introduce journalists and the media to new skills related to their role as mediators in the political communications process.
Finally, in terms of societal impact, policy-makers and political organisations will benefit from the research due to their new understanding of how the communication of policy and debate about policy is received by the general public and how technology can be used to shape these communication practices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>382052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We are proposing to launch Democratic Replay in May 2017.

We conducted twelve focus groups in which we asked a range of different groups to evaluate the 2010 election debates and tell us what they wanted from the debates that are expected to take place in 2015.ii Drawing on this research, we set out five main capabilities of democratic citizenship that the election debates could help to enable and support:
a) 1. To be respected as a rational and independent decision-maker
b) To be able to evaluate political claims and make an informed decision
c) To feel part of the debate as a democratic cultural event
d) To be able to communicate with and be recognized by the leaders who want to represent me
e) To be able to make a difference to what happens in the political world
2. We have started to design a platform that will help citizens/voters to realise these capabilities. The Democratic Replay website we create will synchronise secondary channels around debate videos for a more reflective user experience.One of the challenges of complex debates is that it's hard to track how all the contributions connect (indeed,
they do not always), and the societal challenges we face today are in fact so complex that no single person, party or perspective has 'the solution'. This is where debate visualization technologies have a role to play, helping to show how issues are being framed, who claims to have a solution, how contributions support and challenge each other, and
what evidence, if any, is appealed to, or could be connected. Moreover, the Democratic Replay platform will show who attacked/supported who on which issues. We have a
way to see the 'skeleton' structure of the moves being made.
We have devised a method that automatically detects non-cooperative features in annotated political debates, generating markers that indicate every time a rule is being broken and the nature of the violation. At the end of the dialogue, these markers are aggregated into normalised scores, revealing the extent to which each speaker has conformed to the rules of the
game. These are numbers between 0 and 1 that we call 'degrees of cooperation'.
3. We have been developing a method of instant feedback that is much more nuanced and multi-dimensional than 'the worm' or sentiment analysis. Our method has the following characteristics:
? It is not intrusive to the viewing experience;
? It capture rich nuances of meanings and reactions;
? It is easy to understand and use;
? It relates specifically to key aspects of political communication that we want to measure. 
4. We have now developed and designed the Democratic Replay tool and intend to launch it, in collaboration with the EPSRC, before the end of the project period.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have been talking to leading broadcasters and digital service providers with a view to collaborating with them during the 2015 election debates.

The method consists of a mobile web app that viewers can use as they watch live television to express their views and feelings on the contents. Responses are collected in a repository and time-linked to the broadcast. A suite of online analytics and visualisations of the data allow for analyses of response trajectories and aggregates. These can be individual or collective, based on viewer socio-demographics, political profile, etc. 
The method was tested live during the 2015 UK General Election leaders' debate, involving a panel of 250 viewers across the nation. This resulted in a dataset of nearly 50000 responses. The version of the feedback app consisted of 20 statements in 5 different categories (called &amp;quot;democratic entitlements&amp;quot;): information, respect, engagement, representation and change. The dataset, feedback collection tool, and online analytics will be made available for future research later in the project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5C6FEB5-E394-4B61-A78C-8A31CA512E9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is too early to say.

These result from complex analyses that are time-linked to the video of the debate. We focused on four types of analyses: audience feedback, argument mapping, debate-rule compliance, and performance. Each one results in a set of interactive visualisations that are presented together with and enhancing a debate video. 

We analysed the 2015 UK General Election leaders' debate. This resulted in a hypermedia dataset with timed annotations of the 2-hour debate video and transcript. We also designed and implemented an online tool to replay the debate with the interactive visualisations. The guidelines and tools for producing the analytics, the hypermedia dataset, and the online interactive will be made available for future research later in the project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>15DB78CB-9AB0-446D-A28A-8F3A33118339</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We plan to launch this tool later this year, at which point we hope to be in a position to identify its social impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df1ea2204151.39845172</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Hypermedia analytics and replays of TV election debates</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C05BE334-75C2-4610-909F-B9404E1CBFA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Representation of Women in Publication: An Analysis of Political Communication and the International Journal of Press/Politics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PS: Political Science &amp; Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1d66e6ce79790708cee5786a44e7b884"><gtr:id>1d66e6ce79790708cee5786a44e7b884</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd95195616e4.84734802</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6DB5FDC-E731-4615-8AC8-CBC726F5B514</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging Citizens with Televised Election Debates through Online Interactive Replays</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7981a351b24fb2407204730883875f87"><gtr:id>7981a351b24fb2407204730883875f87</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pluss, B.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd95d4ea1e80.50273729</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A6DBE6BD-3421-4158-8095-B63C6C162D51</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rethinking Election Debates</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International Journal of Press/Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c885e340f274649849abd6925fe7efd"><gtr:id>5c885e340f274649849abd6925fe7efd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coleman S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d5de0921039.63158225</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L003112/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
