Through play children learn life skills essential for future development. Collaboration, communication and creativity are all key components of play. When one or more of these is removed the educational and developmental benefits of the play experience are reduced. For children with normal capabilities this is rarely a persistent issue. For children with disabilities, collaboration, communication and creativity can often be restricted because of their impairment. This often leads to the child feeling marginalised and left out. The research aims to reduce this by using assistive technologies to create a more inclusive play experience between children of different capabilities. Given the time available, the research currently has a focus on supporting two groups of children with impairments, children with autism and children with visual impairments.

The research uses personal wearable display devices (such as META-Pro glasses, Google glass or Optinvent-ORA glasses) as the main tool to enhance the play experience. As well as a speaker and a semi transparent video display that the user wears in front of the eyes, a number of these devices also contain sensors such as an accelerometer, compass, camera and microphone. The research aims to use these sensors to provide children with supplementary information about the current play session that they may not have been previously able to access or understand because of their impairment, thus maximising the learning and developmental benefits of the shared play experience.

The work aims to use computer vision and augmented reality (AR) technologies to create a bridge between a physical and a virtual play space. While the physical space that the children will use is shared and will remain the same for everyone, the virtual space that is projected through the devices worn by the children can be personalised to each child according to their needs and capabilities. This level of personalisation will create a more inclusive play experience and reduce the likelihood of children feeling marginalised.

The focus of the play sessions will be play with Lego bricks and the research has the support of the Lego Foundation (which is the charitable arm of the Lego Group, the third largest manufacturer of play materials in the world). Lego play has been shown to have many developmental benefits and teaches children many skills, such as fine motor skills, sorting skills, basic mathematics, problem solving and teamwork. The effectiveness of some of these skills can be reduced when a child has an impairment. For example, a child with autism may have difficulty understanding other children or expressing his or herself to others, or a visually impaired child may have difficulty searching for, or finding, a particular type of brick. Re-representing aspects of play in a way the child is better able to perceive, or simply by providing assistance in a particular task, can go a long way towards allowing children of different capabilities to effectively play together.

As well as innovating in the technical use of wearable displays, and seeking to design software solutions that work for children with impairments, the research will also produce two inclusive play activity packs for use with wearable display devices in both schools and at home/activity centres. An online community resource called the 'WE ARe ABLE Community Portal' will allow parents/teachers/developers to extend the work and customise the activity packs to their particular needs beyond the life of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will directly benefit children who are currently disadvantaged in group play situations (such as children with visual impairment or children with autism). As the research aims to help support group play and the benefits it has (such as improved teamwork, confidence, communication skills, problem solving skills, fine motor skills and increased physical activity) the project also has societal and economic advantages that will benefit the wider population, such as better health through physical play, increased employability prospects in later life and a better quality of life. In 2012 there were more than 60,000 children in UK schools with autism spectrum disorders and over a half of these children are likely to have difficulties that prevent them functioning well with other children and thus limit their possibilities for play. More than 25,000 children have visual impairments and over half of these are educated in mainstream schools where they will benefit from any technologies that allow their improved play with their peers. Whilst there will be immediate benefits for children engaging in the project, it would be expected that with prolonged use of the technologies the wider benefits associated with long term use (such as increased confidence and teamwork skills) will stay with the children through life.

As well as benefiting children with impairments directly, parents and teachers will also benefit from the research as the work will produce a set of activity packs for use in schools and at home that will allow children with impairments to 'better play' with children with different capabilities. Teachers and carers (parents mainly) that work with children with disabilities are under considerable stress in ensuring an equitable and enriching activity for not only the children with impairments but also for the other children in any play or school session. Depending on the extent of the child's impairment, children are often placed in a school with children with no impairments or with children with a diverse range of impairments and capabilities. By reducing the barriers to play children with impairments face, teachers and parents are better able to take advantage of the learning and development benefits that play offers and, with carefully designed activities, tested in a research study, these adults will be able to focus less on ensuring the personalised play experience for each individual child's needs and more on the collaborative play experience of all participating children.

The technologies that are being produced will be made available, through open source software, to developers across the UK (and beyond). This will provide opportunities for SMEs to build on the code and on the solutions and develop additional activates and associated solutions. The economic benefits of the UK being an early adopter of wearable 'glasses' type technology is significant. time-scale for these benefits to be received is very short. 

Working with Lego, the project aims to impact on the design of toys for collaborative play. The software developed and the solutions that are created will be evaluated with and by Lego researchers with the aim to provide indications for play environments that use virtual and physical playthings. It is expected that in the three or four years following the project, a suite of enhanced play experiences will be commercially available for children, especially for therapeutic play. The WE ARe ABLE project will have informed these designs of the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CFD6D7BA-F7E7-4889-965C-937447B388D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Participatory design of wearable augmented reality display elements for children at play</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6827dd4ef77be824688aff5b9a0d276b"><gtr:id>6827dd4ef77be824688aff5b9a0d276b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cassidy B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d4d7f4ab0627.57004977</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L027658/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
