Transplantation outcomes have improved significantly in recent decades, but chronic rejection remains one of the major challenges facing solid organ transplantation today. Recognition of the transplanted organ by the immune system as foreign is central to this process. There is, however, increasing evidence that the interruption and subsequent restoration of oxygenated blood flow to the organ at the time of transplantation, known as ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI), can not only result in initial organ damage but can also exacerbate chronic rejection. The exact mechanism by which IRI exacerbates chronic rejection is still to be elucidated and there are no established treatments to ameliorate IRI.

Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that are critical for energy production within cells and play a key role in mediating the damaging effects of IRI. Recently, specific mitochondrial-targeted therapies have been developed that have been shown to attenuate IRI. These have already been shown to be safe and effective in extensive animal models and human clinical trials. Their application to transplantation is therefore, very appealing. 

This project will use well-established mouse heart transplant models of chronic rejection to examine the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction and IRI interact with the immune system to exacerbate chronic rejection. Furthermore, the efficacy of mitochondria-targeted therapies in ameliorating chronic rejection after transplantation will be established. We aim to show that IRI has a significant detrimental impact on long term graft outcomes after transplantation, and to examine the underlying mechanisms responsible for the deleterious effects of IRI. Furthermore, we propose to show that mitochondrial-targeted therapies, which have already been shown to be safe in humans in non-transplant settings, can improve long term graft outcomes after transplantation. It is hoped that this study will facilitate the timely and efficient introduction of these therapies into clinical practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the major challenges facing solid organ transplantation and is critically dependent on the alloimmune response. Clinical studies suggest that the ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) inherent to transplantation may also contribute to late allograft dysfunction, although this has not been definitively shown in an experimental setting. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which IRI may augment the alloimmune response to exacerbate CAV are not clear. 

Mitochondria are critical upstream mediators of IRI and may be central to augmentation of the immune response by IRI, through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to mitochondrial DNA, lipids and proteins. We have developed a family of mitochondria-targeted therapies for IRI that have been shown to be safe and effective in extensive animal models and non-transplant Phase II human clinical trials. We have also developed well-characterised heterotopic mouse alloimmune models of CAV after cardiac transplantation, and shown that the indirect alloimmune pathway is likely to mediate development of CAV.

This project examines the principal hypothesis that IRI exacerbates CAV through augmentation of the indirect alloimmune response. I also aim to show that amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction abrogates the alloimmune response and the consequent CAV. To examine these hypotheses, I will quantify the influence of short and long cold ischaemia on mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular damage (including ROS production, DNA and protein damage), indirect alloimmunity (including CD4 T cell activation and alloantibody formation) and CAV using mouse models of chronic cardiac allograft rejection. I propose to show that treatment of the donor heart or recipient animal with mitochondrial-targeted therapies (the antioxidant MitoQ and the S-nitrosating agent MitoSNO respectively) ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, the indirect alloimmune response and ultimately CAV.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Primary potential non-academic beneficiaries of this research are transplant recipients. Chronic organ rejection remains one of the major outstanding challenges facing solid organ transplantation today. IRI is inherent to every solid organ transplanted and has a potential application in improving outcomes after every transplanted solid organ. For individual patients, longer transplant graft survival results directly in improved health and quality of life, for example, avoiding the need for dialysis or hospital admissions. As transplantation is the only life-saving treatment for many types of organ failure (for example, liver failure), better graft survival will also result in reduced death from end-stage organ disease.

Therapies that could ameliorate chronic rejection would help to overcome the national and international organ shortages by reducing the rate of graft loss. In addition to the direct benefit to individual patients outlined above, this would have additional national economic benefits in terms of improved patient graft survival and patient quality of life and actuarial survival. These would be associated with a very significant reduction in the overall healthcare burden and the economy in general. 

With the increasingly well recognised central role of mitochondria to a myriad of other disease pathologies, including cancer, inflammation and cardiac ischaemia, positive results may bring further investment to research and development within the field of mitochondrial dysfunction. This will have a direct benefit for patients with a very wide range of clinical conditions beyond transplantation.

The anticipated positive findings of the study will lead to further translational studies, in large animal and human models. This work will generate further financial investment within the pharmaceutical industry to invest in future work and to expedite translation to the clinical environment. This will include, for example, production of the therapeutic agents under GMP conditions. The lead compound within this group, MitoQ, has already been tested within Phase II trials as a first in class novel therapy and demonstrated an excellent safety profile. Further Phase II trials are planned and if found to be efficacious within the transplant setting, translation into clinical practice could be expected within 3-5 years. There will be a direct economic benefit to the pharmaceutical companies that support product development. This will also result in the creation of jobs and have wider associated economic benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267585</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I have introduced this model to the department of surgery.
