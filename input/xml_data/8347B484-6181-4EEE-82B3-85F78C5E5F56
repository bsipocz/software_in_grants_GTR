Sodium reabsorption by these cells is primarily dependent upon the activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (EnaCs) seated on the apical side of the epithelium. Consistent with a pivotal role of EnaCs in Na+ reabsorption, the activity of these channels is controlled by a number of hormones and other endogenous factors. However, channels kinetics of native EnaCs corresponding to the regulators are rarely studied due to the technique difficulties. This project will investigate the regulation mechanism of EnaCs under different hyposmolality by employing a novel technique. The results would contribute to knowledge of mechanisms of sodium reabsorption in kidney epithelial in response to osmolality change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (EnaCs) are crucial for the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by distal nephron kidney cells and fluid clearance from the lung alveolar spaces. These channels are also found in the apical membranes of polarised epithelial tissues throughout the body, including colon, kidney tubules, sweat glands and airways, and form the rate-limiting step for NA+ reabsorption. Dysfunction of one or more of the EnaC channel subunits in apical epithelia membranes leads to pathological conditions characterised by impaired salt and water balance, such as hypertension. The cell cytoskeleton plays an important role in channel regulation, as do a number of intra- and intercellular signals including ATP, PIP2, [Ca2+]i, Gai activation, protein phosphatases and prostaglandins. However, due to the technical difficulty of recording from epithelial monolayers, the characteristics of EnaCs, the mechanisms of their regulation and the coordination of different regulation mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we are going to employ the novel technique of Smart Patch, which combines conventional patch clamping and scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) to study the ion channels. The enormous increase in accuracy of pipette placement that this technique provides will permit reliable recording from epithelial monolayers. We will investigate modulation of EnaCs activity in response to manipulation of actins, microtubules and molecular motors in the mode of single channel and whole cell recording from renal A6 epithelia monolayers. Chloride channels and Mg-sensitive capacitative Ca2+ entry, which are involved in regulation of EnaCs, will also be studied to clarify channel kinetics, identify channel classifications and understand the regulation mechanism of channels. Cell volume, ATP and intracellular Cl-, Ca2+ will be simultaneously monitored in response to hyposmolality The events sequence are listed, correlated and studied with selective agonists and antagonists. The results will elucidate the activity of renal epithelia cells in response to hyposmolality and how the mechanisms by which the cells manage to reset the balance of the different endogeous regulators in achieving sodium reabsorption rate in response to different osmolality.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>271736</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E4B31752-9E0B-4A0F-B0CE-8BDB71C5CF6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of extracellular nucleotides on [Ca2+]i signalling in a human-derived renal proximal tubular cell line (HKC-8).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cellular biochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b9a5661beaae8565493b64d457bda6b8"><gtr:id>b9a5661beaae8565493b64d457bda6b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turvey MR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0730-2312</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758cbd82009</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D524032/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
