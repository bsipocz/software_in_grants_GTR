A new composition will be written for the JACK Quartet, an American string quartet specialising in new and experimental music. \n\nThe aim of the research is to generate a more singular, unified approach to multi-layered string tablature. Previous experiments with the so-called 'parametricisation' of string technique have resulted in increasingly dense, stratified, and visually dispersed approaches to musical notation (often with music for solo performer written on as many as half a dozen discrete staves). This new project sets out with the intention of composing works which maintain a similar level of control and specificity of physical, performative movements whilst 'compressing' and integrating notational data into a visual image that is more readily assimilable by the performer. The aim is to find an approach to notation that maintains the crucial complexity of the musical and performative material while dramatically simplifying its visual presentation and creating a much more direct and immediate relationship between musical notation and performer action.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wider impact of the AHRC-funded research will be amongst composer and performer practitioners, and of course amongst listeners and concertgoers. In addition to published peer-reviewed articles, the most significant dissemination tool for the research will be the performance by the JACK Quartet at the Donaueschingen Festival in October 2010, which is scheduled to be recorded and broadcast by Sudwestrundfunk (SWR) in Germany and streamed online. The Donaueschinger Musiktage is one of the most significant festivals for new music, with a uniquely international audience and substantial influence and reach among composers and performers. Notably, the premiere of the newly-commissioned string quartet is scheduled on a day devoted to string repertoire, including new commissions by a number of notable composers for the JACK, Diotima, and Arditti string quartets. The focus on strings and string technique provides particularly strong dissemination opportunities and will help draw interest to the companion article.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17190</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>6A61123C-D4FA-45E2-8114-C720C8584026</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-3730644661.682327a7136ba6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Second String Quartet (3)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>901BCD40-7DB1-4AB1-9702-A40D07867DAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-6257683677.838821a7149396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Second String Quartet (2)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>B7346938-774C-472C-A091-429BCDD7E0A9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-2913524688.140978a714c3f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Score to Second String Quartet</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Commercial CD release by NEOS label of premeire performance of Second String Quartet, JACK Quartet, Donaueschingen 2010.

Unlike a typical programme note, I was asked to contribute a longer essay (ca. 2000 words) about the piece and the approach to the string quartet and about the notation specifically. A page of the score was reproduced in the programme book.

unknown -- there was an audience of ca. 900-1000 listeners, and the work was later broadcast extensively on the radio on a number of European stations. The work was also released on CD, and a YouTube video has received ca. 4k views to date.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3693309001.3389560bb46844</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The notational system developed during the study is beginning to appear in the creative work of others, particularly in the work of PhD-level composers at various institutions worldwide (including Harvard, University of Melbourne, University of Victoria BC, etc.). Works including this notational approach have been performed at, for example, the Darmstadt Ferienkurse in Germany and the June in Buffalo Festival in the USA. 

The work has been discussed with citations in both academic and non-specialist publications, including Irvine Arditti's 'Die Spieltechnik der Violine' and a profile article in The Atlantic magazine (Karen Loew, 'Squiggles are the new quarter notes: why music looks different now', The Atlantic. Oct 2013).

The work has also been used in Dance and choreography, including a major project led by the Australian theatre company Not Yet Its Difficult, with sponsorship from Hellerau Dresden.</gtr:description><gtr:id>179EE956-B21A-4188-BAD0-03874039C6E9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5440fc42634bf5.84861365</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The newly developed notation has enabled a more streamlined approach to string tablature, condensing and simplifying the more visually unstable and difficult aspects of earlier multi-parametric notation. Most significantly, this notation has allowed a new approach to string writing, moving away from a pitch-centred thinking (in which aspects of timbre, bow pressure, and bow position are seen as secondary characteristics) into one in which the movement of the bow can act as a carrier of primary content. The notation itself prioritizes these physical movements such that previously secondary and tertiary musical parameters can be moved to the foreground. This will surely provide useful/fruitful musical and creative opportunities for future composers, who may find new ways to control and manipulate such parameters to create new expressive outputs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In this case, the line between inside and outside of academia is reasonably thin. The outputs are primarily creative in nature and have thus far had their widest distribution outside of academic circles. The work has been presented at a major international music festival in Germany, with widespread press and major radio broadcasts, and upcoming performances will include additional music festivals and lectures outside of the academic world.

The musical impacts inside of academia are as widespread as outside of academia.

Additionally, a further project extending on the string research has been followed, applying the multi-colour tablature notation system to voices. The piece 'A painter of figures in rooms' was commissioned by PRSF New Music 20x12 and the London Cultural Olympiad 2012. The work was premiered at Southbank Centre in July 2012, was broadcast by BBC Radio 3, and has been released on CD by NMC records (live) and HCR (studio recording). 

Further creative extensions of the approach are planned in works for Australia's ELISION ensemble in a project to be premiered in 2016.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A769A593-DAF8-4CEC-8EE2-F11036302EC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5449000555.508771775fafca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E09B0DB2-4C7E-4FF2-B053-1B41E18164A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glossikes epafes ston elliniko</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c4071973abd1acbe8b24ed87049fe732"><gtr:id>c4071973abd1acbe8b24ed87049fe732</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pia Wohland (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_7088835434640fa416</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>49A92684-6146-403F-81B0-6C2140579D10</gtr:id><gtr:title>The String Quartet as Laboratory and Playground for Experimentation and Tradition (or, Opening Out/Closing In)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contemporary Music Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1575bf36a1bb4cb374f6cb5c8bd617e3"><gtr:id>1575bf36a1bb4cb374f6cb5c8bd617e3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cassidy A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5440fda5c0f8d3.15946945</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C27772A-DC04-4E0C-B1EB-972F32D27FA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constraint Schemata, Multi-axis Movement Modeling, and Unified, Multi-parametric Notation for Strings and Voices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Search Journal for New Music and Culture</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1575bf36a1bb4cb374f6cb5c8bd617e3"><gtr:id>1575bf36a1bb4cb374f6cb5c8bd617e3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cassidy A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5440fe155353d8.70695361</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A722EDD1-885A-4C97-9B9E-B314E50D05E9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Techniques of Violin Playing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/909dddea2330ed9cd85df39151aa0d15"><gtr:id>909dddea2330ed9cd85df39151aa0d15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arditti Irvine</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9783761822678</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5440fea9af7751.60569019</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H018417/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13304AD-8058-4333-86C7-DB798216A696</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
