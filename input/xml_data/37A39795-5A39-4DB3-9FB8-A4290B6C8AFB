and adversity: a mixed-methods longitudinal secondary analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K003550/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Much emphasis is being placed on the role of the volunteer in British society. The Coalition government's policies envisage that more needs can be met through community initiative, relying on voluntary effort. This project looks at volunteering between 1981-2012, a timeframe which includes two times of economic adversity and one of relative prosperity. It combines qualitative data from the Mass Observation Project, where people freely write on topics such as voluntary unpaid work, welfare, volunteering and the state, with existing quantitative data on individuals? engagement, as found in the British Household Panel Survey/ Understanding Society, the General Lifestyle Survey and the British Social Attitudes Survey.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This innovative mixed methods longitudinal research investigates trajectories in and out of volunteering, motivations for and barriers to volunteering, individual and community capacity for engagement, and views on the roles and responsibilities of the State, local communities, and the individual in meeting social need. The project will contribute to theoretical understandings of attitudes towards volunteering; build capacity in mixed methodological innovation; and contribute to key user group debates on recent legislative and policy changes relating to localism, and welfare reform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project has received ethical approval from the University of Southampton?s Ethics Committee.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research has the potential to support effective management of and support for volunteers both in the short and long term through increased understanding of volunteering attitudes, behaviour and experiences, and of how these may be shaped by changing economic conditions over time. Volunteer-involving agencies will better understand the experiences of current and potential participants, and can plan involvement strategies accordingly. In particular, we have the opportunity to add immediate value to work to build sustainable local communities undertaken by the new economics foundation who will be involved as users of the research throughout the project's lifetime. These benefits can therefore contribute to increasing the effectiveness of public services, which are to a growing degree being delivered by relying on greater inputs from volunteers, and to enhancing quality of life, since a fuller understanding of voluntary action should increase the extent to which individuals benefit from undertaking it. 

Social researchers in academic and non-academic organisations will also benefit from this research substantively and methodologically. Substantively, knowledge about volunteering and how we may measure and understand it will be increased and in the longer term this will feed through into further research - and also into teaching in the case of academic researchers. Methodologically, the project will enhance research skills and capacity: in the immediate term, this will be through the transcription and archival deposit of MO directives for reuse by other researchers; in the longer term through the bringing together of qualitative and quantitative longitudinal data sets for secondary analysis in social research. 

The skills of the early career staff working on the project will be enhanced through developing expertise about understandings and experiences of volunteering and researching it over time using archived data. We also envisage that these staff will gain skills and experience through being able to play a leading role in managing the proposed project. This academic and practical experience and knowledge will stand them in good stead in the wider job market in the longer term.

The main beneficiaries from the research outputs will be users from:

1. The third sector, including a range of volunteer-involving organisations both large and small. We know of interest on the part of large national organisations, e.g. the National Trust, in work investigating longitudinal aspects of volunteer supply and motivation. Beneficiaries will also include organisations that play a substantial role in recruiting volunteers, such as local Councils for Voluntary Service, or national organisations such as Community Service Volunteers.

2. Third and private sector research and consultancy agencies / think tanks; the new economics foundation is involved as an advisory board member and user of research outputs but others would include the Institute for Volunteering Research, the Institute for Voluntary Action Research, the RSA, Demos, the Young Foundation, and ResPublica. Findings would also be of benefit to funders of voluntary organisations, such as Community Foundations. 

3. Government, notably the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Office for Civil Society in the Cabinet Office.

4. Businesses concerned with the recruitment and motivation of volunteers as part of corporate social responsibility programmes.

5. Public sector agencies and organisations delivering public services, who also use substantial numbers of volunteers, and may do so to a growing degree; these would include, at a minimum, NHS trusts, the education, police and social services, and leisure and cultural services. 

Other groups who may benefit from the research include:

6. Volunteers themselves and the general public.

7.

They were a mixed audience of post-doctoral researchers, doctoral students, undergraduates and lay researchers. We held an interactive day long workshop, introducing the Mass Observation Project to people who were very new users of the archive, or who had never used the archive. Participants had a tour of the archive, discussion of challenges in using the archive, introduction to older sources held by the archive, discussion of ethics, and hands-on work with sample scripts.
The event was widely advertised but capped at 20 attendees.

We were also invited to give a presentation at the State of Social Capital in Britain in November 2015 as part of the ESRC's Festival of Social Science, which was attended by voluntary sector practitioners, social action pioneers, public service reformers, policy makers, think tanks and academics. We subsequently published this as an open access online working paper. We also reported to NCVO's Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise Sector Review in 2015. 

We anticipate that impact will gather further momentum over the next year, 2016, with the publication of an accessible book, by Policy Press, that can be read by stakeholder audiences, such as policy makers and people working or volunteering in the voluntary sector. When we presented our findings to the VSSN conference (September 2014), to a combined audience of policy makers, practitioners and academics, we were informed by attendees and discussants that the project's findings on routes into and out of volunteering provide new ways of conceptualising volunteering, 'pushing forward our understanding of volunteering'. The paper attracted considerable interest and provoked discussion during and after the presentation. The book, which builds on these longitudinal findings, will be the first of its kind, and we anticipate that it will shake up debate within the voluntary sector and policy maker audience, particularly in relation to new ways of thinking about the routes into and out of volunteering, and practical considerations of when in the life-course practitioners and policy makers might capture and retain volunteers. 

In 2014 we reached international policy and practitioner audiences, presenting a paper at the International Society for Third Sector Research in Munster, in July. The team from United Nations Volunteering expressed an interest in our work on trajectories in volunteering, and requested a copy of the paper. We also shared quantitative data findings from the project with the new economic foundation, to inform their work on the voluntary sector, the Big Society, and time-banking; 

Earlier work done by this project in 2013, on The Big Society, when we presented academic papers to the British Sociological Association, and the Political Studies Association, and published an accessible online working paper, attracted attention in the online press community. Publications such as The Third Sector magazine; Charity Financials; Public Finance; oneastmidlands.org.uk; the social policy digest; and The Guardian, reported on our findings (although we note that not all reported particularly accurately). Since then this paper has been used by some voluntary action organisations, for example, LSVC, in their work on 'The Big Squeeze'. 

The project also had methodological impacts. We drew on Mass Observation writing as a source of secondary data, and identified that this writing could be used longitudinally. We talked about this in a Mass Observation conference in 2012, when we discussed how we sampled Mass Observation writers, when bidding for funding from the ESRC's Secondary Data Analysis Initiative. We have been informed, anecdotally by the Archive, that this has changed the way in which people are approaching the Archive - individual researchers (lay and academic) have been able to see the potential to follow writers through time. 

This conference paper, and the process of applying for funding to the ESRC, led to us successfully bidding for further funding for another ESRC secondary data project (ES/LO13819/1) This project opens up the Mass Observation Archive's metadata, and makes it easier for all users of the archive, and potential users, to use the Archive. It also enables people using the Archive to do so confidently, by providing robust data on who the writers are, making them a knowable sample (responding to older criticisms that the Archive is not representative of the broader British public). We have noted that an online paper published out of this conference has been used by lecturers at the University of Bristol, as part of their undergraduate course 'Investigating the Social'.

The project has also developed our understanding of longitudinal mixed-methods, which we have been applying to other types of research. We advised the research team seeking funding to investigate the changing experiences of people who use mental health services 2006 to 2015 on mixed-methods and use of qualitative data. The funding was successful, we hope this project will impact positively on the lives of mental health service-users, by producing examples of good practice, and identifying where these individuals are being failed by service providers. In another project, we hope to employ longitudinal mixed-methods to investigate changing individual experiences of, and attitudes to, race and racism over time. Again, we hope, if successful this will have a positive impact people who come from an ethnic minority background.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E73BB1AC-9788-4D6E-B8DC-5E8B6CA4F162</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545263b87dcc65.26147698</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>TRAJECTORIES IN AND OUT OF VOLUNTEERING
Our project fills a gap in knowledge about the volunteering behaviours of engaged British citizens over time. Our analyses of mixed longitudinal data enabled us to identify patterns of engagement with volunteering over a considerable portion of the individual life-course. 

We found that more than two-thirds (71 percent) of representative British Household Panel Survey/Understanding Society (BHPS/US) survey participants who reported volunteering between 1996 and 2011 volunteered only once or twice during this 15 year timeframe. This high proportion of individuals contributed less than half of the volunteering activity (46%) undertaken by BHPS/US participants in this timeframe. 

The proportion of people who were long-term volunteers between 1996 and 2011 is relatively small, amounting to less than a third (29 percent) of BHPS/US participants. Crucially however, this small proportion of individuals contributed over half (54%) the total amount of voluntary activity reported by BHPS/US respondents over time.

The 38 Mass Observation Project (MOP) writers sampled for this study were long-term volunteers whose writing offered insights into trajectories in and out of formal and informal volunteering over the life-course. Writers discussed how and why they stopped, started, and continued volunteering across their life-courses. This enabled us to identify six patterns of participation. 

We found writers who:

1. did no additional volunteering apart from their MOP writing (n.2); 
2. contributed one additional short-term piece of volunteering (n.2);
3. were stop-start volunteers (n.6); 
4. stuck to one or two causes over their volunteering life-course (n.7);
5. were pragmatic volunteers, swapping their volunteering in response to needs created by life-events such as a child starting nursery, or school (n.11); 
6. liked or needed change, and regularly swapped the causes and organisations for which they volunteered (n.10).
Triggers for exiting or entering different types of volunteering included life events such as starting or leaving a job, children entering the education system, or a spouse taking retirement. Events that represented a trigger for exiting volunteering for some writers, represented a trigger for entering volunteering for others. 

Given that recruitment and retention of volunteers are key issues for policy makers and practitioners, we advocated a policy shift in focus away from individual motivations for volunteering, to a focus on the stages of the life-course when people are most likely to exit or enter volunteering.

INCREASING ACCESS TO MOP WRITING
We are the first researchers to follow individual MOP writers across time. We highlighted the longitudinal and mixed-method research opportunities offered by the MOP through presentations, a workshop, and a blog. Researchers with whom we have shared our expertise have since begun using the archive longitudinally.

Our work on sampling MOP writing led to our engagement in debates about the representativeness of MOP writers; and our discovery of underutilised qualitative and quantitative MOA data. In partnership with the Mass Observation Archive (MOA) we gained funding for a subsequent project which asks: 'Who are the MOP writers?' This will open up the resource to more users, enabling more confident sampling of MOP writing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is the first British research on longitudinal volunteering behaviours and attitudes. Our findings provide policy makers and voluntary organisations with insights into how individuals negotiate volunteering across their lives. 

We have identified the proportions and characteristics of people who are short-term and continuous long-term volunteers; how much they contribute; and why both types of contribution are valuable to British society. These findings provide policy makers and voluntary organisations with insights that will enable them to recruit these two groups for different purposes, and manage their expectations of these groups. 

Our qualitative work found that few writers concurred on the definition of volunteering, and few considered their volunteering within a national context. There appear to be key stages in the lives of long-term volunteers, when they are most likely to enter, exit, or swap their volunteering. Developing these findings further could change the way in which policy makers, practitioners and local organisations conceptualise volunteering, and enable them to target people at particular life-stages for recruitment and retention. 

Our innovative combining of longitudinal survey data with Mass Observation Project (MOP) data, and our longitudinal use of MOP writing, opened up opportunities for researcher to work in new ways with MOP data.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E9ECA7E-9224-491C-B42C-1859387C5EF6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545268fc1923e6.73740036</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://longitudinalvolunteering.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to the Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise Sector Review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DA177A8-1FFE-47FF-85B9-7BC21B1758E4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cd9e21c0e6c0.63298183</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Analyses of individual trajectories through volunteering 1996-2011</gtr:description><gtr:id>755CC67B-B489-4BFB-878E-15BF91ADF820</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Results have been shared in conferences, with considerable interests in individual trajectories into volunteering.

We also blogged about our longitudinal use of the Mass Observation Project. This has raised awareness that the archive could be used in this way. Several researchers have demonstrated interest in taking up this approach, and we have been informed of several individuals who have applied for funding using this approach, subsequently, as a result of our initiative. In April 2012 we submitted our funding bid to the ESRC and presented at the July 2012 Mass Observation Conference, where we had several discussions with individuals who were interersted in the longitudinal opportunities offered by the Mass Observation project. We had a long discussion with the historian James Hinton, botjh about the longitudinal opportunities of MOP and how to use MOP metadata to follow individual writers, This researcher has gone on to use the Mass Observation Archive to follow individual writers and explore their life-courses. He has subsequently published a longitudinal piece on 7 Mass Observers. 

We presented on this research at the Research Methods Festival in July 2014; and we ran a training workshop on longitudinal and mixed-method use of Mass Observation in October 2014. Some of those who attended the Research Methods Festival presentation also attended the training workshop. Workshop attendees included undergraduates, post-graduates, ECRs and established researchers. Feedback was very positive, with researchers very interested in pursuing longitudinal use of Mass Observation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608aa785fa83.76520985</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Using Mass Observation Archive data longitudinally and as part of a mixed-methods project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A07770D7-32AF-4815-B69F-F07E0004D8B2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shifting the dials?
