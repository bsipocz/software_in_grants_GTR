A recent
European study of passenger cars estimates that each year 10% tyre under-inflation generates
&amp;pound;2.4 billion in wasted fuel and 4.8 million tonnes excess CO2 emissions (1). This also means
12.2 million tyres are removed from service each year due to accelerated tyre wear. The UK
accounts for approximately 10% of European consumption. In 2007 there were over 1,000
accidents resulting in 43 deaths on British roads and scores injured due to defective tyres (2).
Moreover, a UK survey in January 2009, involving 60,000 vehicles found &amp;gt;7,000 vehicles
(11%) with at least one illegal tyre (3). This amounts to &amp;gt;3.6 million vehicles on Britain?s
roads with illegal tyres.
In the commercial vehicle sector waste in fuel, tyres and CO2 emissions are due to poor tyre
management, under-inflation, poor wheel alignment, worn suspension and aggressive driving
behavior. UK surveys show wastage of &amp;gt;&amp;pound;150 million in fuel and &amp;gt;400 tonnes CO2 pa (4).
However, as a tyre wears it becomes more fuel efficient. This is associated with a reduction
by up to one third in rolling resistance (5, 6). Data for commercial vehicles suggest that tyres
in a worn condition can improve vehicle fuel efficiency by up to 9% compared to new tyres
(7). The fleet operator must therefore continuously monitor tyre wear and properly maintain
tyres to generate maximum vehicle fuel efficiency.
In the UK routine examination of commercial vehicle tyres is required by law comprising a
daily driver check and six and 13 weekly workshop checks. The workshop checks are a visual
inspection of the tyre wear condition and presence of damage, a tread depth measurement
using a point depth gauge and a tyre pressure check. For passenger cars the only formal check
of the tyre condition is during the annual MOT. Current methods to check tyre wear and
pressure are therefore inadequate.
Prospective clients indicate that a portable, tyre wear measurement device that is accurate and
eliminates operator variation and error is desirable for workshop use. The hand held
TreadReader scanner offers these benefits and has recently been launched commercially.
However sites with a large number of vehicle movements, such as distribution centres, car
dealerships and petrol station forecourts require an automated solution and a drive over
version of TreadReader has been requested that includes a tyre pressure measurement
capability.
