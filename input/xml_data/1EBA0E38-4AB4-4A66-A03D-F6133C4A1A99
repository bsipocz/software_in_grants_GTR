The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. The material and other costs covered by this application are central to the program of research proposed for the fellowship.\n\nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro eki or boiling colour solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\n\nIrogane alloys are produced primarily on a small scale by skilled craftsmen with many years experience. In order to realise the potential of these alloys it is necessary to study the metallurgy of the alloys and the variations that result from the use of traditional and modern casting techniques. An understanding of the structure and behaviour of the cast alloys may also lead to improvements in the alloys, their processing, and the quality and consistency of the finished products. We will also look at the optimisation of the alloys for practical studio work through the use of micro alloys to control mechanical properties such as hardness and ductility.\n\nThis project will look specifically at the reliable production of shakudo (gold/copper), shibuichi (copper/silver), and kuromido (copper/arsenic) alloys. An initial list of alloy compositions to study will include Cu-99% Au-1%, Cu97% Au-3% and Cu-70% Ag-30%. Subject to health and safety considerations a Cu-99% As-1% is also a candidate material.\n\nThe research will ask:\n\n1. What are the fundamental metallurgical properties of the irogane alloys?\n\n2. How do the alloys respond to small workshop and industrial production methods? Do they differ and in what way?\n\n3. How will the metallurgical properties of the alloys change during processing and practical studio work?\n\n4. How can we optimise the materials for practical studio work through the use of microalloys?\n\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC) and the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI). There is a strong team of highly experienced and internationally recognised Metalwork and Jewellery staff at ADRC to support the research. MERI has the background of precious metals research, and the extensive equipment and materials characterisation techniques essential to support this research. \n\nPapers will be submitted to scientific, design and craft related journals. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers, exhibited works etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\n\nThe research program will allow me to significantly advance knowledge of technical issues relating to irogane alloys. This project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as high quality alloys will be necessary for the study of the niiro patination technique and the production of my studio work. The proposed research will build on traditional craft knowledge and on contemporary technical research. This research will be a great contribution to the understanding of Japanese metalsmithing techniques, providing information and solutions to the problems faced by contemporary metalsmiths working with these materials, while also widening the area of possible applications and expression. This research will be of interest to metalsmiths, product designers, the metal finishing industry, and the materials science community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Silverstruck exhibition celebrates the current strength of contemporary silversmithing in the UK, reflecting new directions realised by traditional and cutting-edge techniques.

From Richard Rabel's blog discussing the Five into Four exhibition:

C?il?n ? Dubhghaill is one of the brilliant young designers keeping alive the age-old tradition of silversmithing. There are too few artists like him, so we must show our support for ? Dubhghaill! His works have a noticeably Eastern influence and that is no coincidence - he studied in Japan and received a doctorate for research into traditional Japanese metalwork techniques (the Japanese have a marvelous history of incorporating different metals into stunning pieces). One of my favorite pieces in this show is his &amp;quot;Ritual 9&amp;quot;. Taking a cue from traditional Japanese koros, this vessel has the most beautiful speckled finish. The paper-thin silver is also an amazing contrast to what appears to be a very weighty object.

Another of his works in the show is this elegant bowl &amp;quot;Ceo 7&amp;quot;. Fashioned from a copper and gold alloy, I first took this for pottery until I looked closer. An &amp;quot;? Dubhghaill&amp;quot; piece for sure, I thought, this time working outside of silver to create this earthy, yet sophisticated piece. While we mere mortals would think working with copper or silver is the same, the talent in bringing these two different pieces to such a high level of perfection and beauty is actually quite a feat!</gtr:description><gtr:id>29192751-37CB-49F3-8B3B-1ACFCDA9D16A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this exhibition was purchased for the Irish State Art Collection.

This research tests the application of irogane alloy and newly developed synthetic niiro patination techniques through the production of a series of decorative vessels. By introducing Japanese alloys into the domain of the traditional silversmith, this work also challenges perceptions of fine crafted metal objects, disregarding hierarchies of value set up by precious metal commodity markets and the institution of the hallmark. 

Resulting from the application of material and process knowledge developed during earlier laboratory based testing these artefacts are an outcome from the practiced based study into Japanese metalworking techniques. (Irogane alloys and niiro patination).Small scale laboratory samples produced consistent results with the synthetic niiro solution but full exploration of the material and process properties and behaviours required extensive large scale craft workshop activity. Through this ongoing series of vessels, utilising hand forged hammer techniques and fabrication; creative possibilities have been explored by combining an extended range of irogane alloys beyond the standard palette usually encountered. The intrinsic material qualities and subtle variations of colours have been further exploited through surface enrichment and selective polishing resulting in surface finishes with new variegated colours.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8A827B52-7577-4C33-9BA5-8AE435EE1563</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this collection was purchased for the Marzee collection, Netherlands in 2012.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1955770526.0401318a710b2c6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Coilin O'Dubhghaill at Galerie Marzee, Netherlands</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Beneath the Skin brings together eight academic researchers working within the field of contemporary metalwork and jewellery in order to reveal the research that underpins the object. 

The aim of the exhibition is to visualise and articulate the complex, multi-faceted and often non-linear creative journey that individual researchers make to get to the final object. It built upon and extended the enquiry started during the KeyPiece exhibition and research event in 2009 where the exhibited objects devoid of any textural explanation provided the basis for intensive critical discourse between participants in order to reveal the embedded knowledge. By presenting a range of tangible textual and non-textual material, Beneath the Skin aims to elicit and reveal the knowledge embodied by the object and proposed that there are intangible aspects within creative research that are not possible to quantify.

The project was initiated by Coilin O'Dubhghaill and developed in collaboration with Maria Hanson and Christoph Zellweger. The project was described in detail in the publication: HANSON, Maria and WOOD, Nicola (2010). KeyPiece: Creating a critical dialogue in contemporary craft; Design and craft: A history of convergences and divergences: 7th Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS), Brussels, Belgium, 20-22 September 2010. 

The exhibited pieces provided the basis for discussion between the makers, along with other pieces brought along by the makers that were considered significant but not necessarily suitable for exhibition. The question of how a keypiece can be identified and defined led the makers to develop an understanding of the different roles objects they make play within their practice. 

The participants were: Lionel Dean, Coilin O'Dubhghaill, Sara O'Hana, Maria Hanson, Grace Horn, Antje Illner, Drummond Masterson, Tine de Ruysser, Lucian Taylor and Christoph Zellweger.

This project was supported by funding from Arts Council England/National Lottery and the Art and Design Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76E05955-C0F1-4CF1-8FDF-D0E680A93C67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Keypiece project developed dialogue looking at the relationship between objects and research within the metalwork research community which lead to the Beneath The Skin project and exhibitions, see: http://www.mariahanson.co.uk/beneath-the-skin/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-2115971429.3814929a712b210</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Keypiece Exhibition, Sheffield</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I showed a group of patinated vessels developed during the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3995F559-FFED-4D4E-B1BF-A48E04C7C309</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition provided an important networking opportunity and lead to the sale of work to private collections and further exhibition invitations: domesticMATTERS at CAA in 2012 and Collect at Saatchi Gallery in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-6143899025.529529a711b1bc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>'Focus', Contemporary Applied Arts, London</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of vessels produced as a result of the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>85D975FD-6C53-4E0A-A7AD-934447AF06FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European networking</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463fed77c6e83.63614658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>'Future Beauty', National Craft Gallery, Kilkenny, Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Seven Smiths: new work in metal and silver

13 November - 31 December 2007

Seven Smiths brings together the new work of seven of the UK's leading silversmiths. Each has exhibited widely both in the UK and internationally, and between them their work is represented in most of the major public collections. Blackwell, filled with exquisite handwork in wood, stone and plaster, provides the peculiarly fitting backdrop for these new examples of an age-old craft. Some of the pieces made for Seven Smiths have evolved as a direct response to the Arts and Crafts Movement, the house and its spectacular setting.

Silversmith/designer Coilin O'Dubhghaill studied for a doctorate in Tokyo, where he mastered a range of techniques using coloured metal inlays, or irogane, which he now uses in combination to create vessel forms with an emphasis on surface pattern and colour. He is currently a research fellow at Sheffield Hallam University, researching the production and application of Japanese alloys, such as the copper/gold shakudo alloy, and their patination.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C53C11C-9F6B-41D6-BD22-D3FCEC8D8E47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK networking</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-9638933129.272362a7116090</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Seven Smiths, Blackwell, Bowness-on-Windermere</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.blackwell.org.uk/exhibitions/seven-smiths-new-work-metal-and-silver</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of vessels produced as a result of the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9CE0CD19-756F-44E9-891C-A47785B7B393</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European networking</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463fd6baa8b75.21490437</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Frame at Schmuck, Internationale Handwerks Messe, Munich, 2013</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>COLLECT: The International Art Fair for Contemporary Objects brings together the world's finest galleries representing exceptional work of museum-quality from their portfolio of artists.

This has led to the production of work for exhibition internationally and to the production of prototypes for jewellery retail manufacture.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463e34e42a862.25032776</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/whats-on/events/2013/3/art-chemistry-and-colour-in-metalwork</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keypiece research event and exhibition, Sheffield Hallam University.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB8BF783-1B0D-4EF4-ABDF-C352D40B879B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>KeyPiece was a combined public exhibition and research event bringing together leading UK metalworking practitioners and their work in November 2009. The project was initiated by Coilin O'Dubhghaill and developed in collaboration with Maria Hanson and Christoph Zellweger. The project was described in detail in the publication: HANSON, Maria and WOOD, Nicola (2010). KeyPiece: Creating a critical dialogue in contemporary craft; Design and craft: A history of convergences and divergences: 7th Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS), Brussels, Belgium, 20-22 September 2010. 

The exhibited pieces provided the basis for discussion between the makers, along with other pieces brought along by the makers that were considered significant but not necessarily suitable for exhibition. The question of how a keypiece can be identified and defined led the makers to develop an understanding of the different roles objects they make play within their practice. 

The participants were: Lionel Dean, Coilin O'Dubhghaill, Sara O'Hana, Maria Hanson, Grace Horn, Antje Illner, Drummond Masterson, Tine de Ruysser, Lucian Taylor and Christoph Zellweger.

This project was supported by funding from Arts Council England/National Lottery and the Art and Design Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University.


The Keypiece project developed dialogue looking at the relationship between objects and research within the metalwork research community which lead to the Beneath The Skin project and exhibitions, see: http://www.mariahanson.co.uk/beneath-the-skin/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3025007539.452060b9fd99c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture delivered in Metalsmithing department, Tokyo National University of Fine Art and Music, Japan</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CB7847F-76C7-4E55-9764-9B7BA306725A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation provoked discussion about research into craft processes and the contrasting approaches used in the European and Japanese traditions.

In order to realise the potential of these alloys it is necessary to study the metallurgy of the alloys and the variations that result from the use of traditional and modern casting techniques. Through our study of the alloys we have improved our understanding of the structure and behaviour of the cast alloys and their processing, and the quality and consistency of the milled sheet.



The alloy production research focused on 3 main alloys 50/50 Cu/Ag, 75/25 Cu/Ag and 98/2 Cu/Au. These are representative of shibuichi (au/ag alloys) and shakudo (cu/au) alloys. The alloys were produced using industrial protective atmosphere casting methods and traditional non-protective atmosphere workshop casting methods. The workshop alloys were cast into both traditional water moulds (yudokobuki) and steel moulds. We produced rolled materials from each alloy in the as-rolled and annealed conditions. This sheet was produced under industrial conditions using controlled atmosphere annealing and large rolling mills and under workshop conditions using torch annealing and hammer forging/ small rolling mills. This produced more than 100 samples for characterisation.



The most important aspects in terms of characterising these alloys are; (i) as-cast quality in terms of inclusions/porosity etc. (ii) micro-structure and how it changes with rolling/annealing, and (iii) mechanical behaviour (e.g. hardness, strength, ductility and annealing behaviour).



The study has revealed information that will aid us in both the successful production of the alloys and their patination:



Surface enrichment of one of the two phases of the structure in Ag/Cu alloys can be exploited for decorative effect during surface patination.



Variation in the grain size and in the microstructures of the eutectic phase depending upon the cooling rate of each casting method influences behaviour during rolling/hammering and surface patination.



Variations in porosity depending on casting methods. For steel moulds the porosity was large and concentrated in the areas that were last to solidify, i.e. in the centre of the section and towards the top of the ingot. For the water cast materials the porosity was smaller but more numerous and distributed more evenly throughout the cross-section. Virtually no porosity was observed in the sections through the continuous cast ingots. Porosity levels have a significant effect on the material quality, especially after rolling. 



In addition to this research in alloy production we have prepared samples of 34 traditional alloy combinations- cu/au, cu/ag and cu/au/ag which will be used to assess the range of alloy colours achievable during our research into Niiro patination.



Through this study of irogane alloys, their casting and processing methods, we have developed our understanding of their metallurgical properties and an indication of the quality parameters of the various casting methods. It is clear that continuous casting under protective atmosphere is superior to the traditional studio methods. However, it has been very useful to clarify the quality and properties of studio cast alloys as this method is still commonly used by craftspeople and for the production of alloy samples.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB5E6357-C6DD-40CD-BF04-82B4C36E2646</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2506908199.29065947760f538</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>336BE030-A690-4AE7-A281-F5F090D55894</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reliable Irogane Alloys and Niiro Patination- Further Study of Production and Application to Jewelry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Santa Fe Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872"><gtr:id>cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>A.H.
