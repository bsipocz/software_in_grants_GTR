Projects will be designed to demonstrate how routinely collected administrative data sets can be used to answer important questions and ultimately inform policy makers. For example, monitoring routinely collected health and education data over time has the potential to enhance the existing questionnaire based evaluation of the ?Flying Start? early years support intervention, by providing additional outcome measures - changes in levels of service utilisation and educational outcome over time. All project outputs will provide detail on the strengths and weaknesses of utilising routine data.&lt;br />&lt;br />The researcher will use individual based records that flow into the Secure Anonymised Individual Linked (SAIL) databank at Swansea University (the researcher is an approved senior analyst). SAIL continuously and routinely receives data from a broad range of health and education sources. The anonymised nature of the data collection is such that overarching ethical approval is in place for its use in research. All project proposals will be carried out within the Governance framework surrounding the data.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal aims to show that:
 
Working with anonymised linked data, from a wide range of sources, is achievable within Information Governance law.

Adding value to routinely collected data, through linkage, is incredibly powerful in validation, in making the data more understandable, making links and connections that have never before been possible. 

The process will enable data owners working together with linkage specialists, to understand how to create and maintain suitably robust anonymised linkage and how to manage suitable access to the resulting data systems.

Objective 1. Evaluation comparing Flying Start areas with other areas is designed to illustrate that linked data can inform the outcome of an intervention, possibly highlight how outcomes might be masked by external factors such as migration, and demonstrate the ability of data linkage to suggest how the focus of future interventions may be more closely targeted. This will have direct local value, but the findings will be portable to other populations, so of use across the UK and beyond.

Objective 2. Analysis of diabetic patients service utilisation, over time, is intended to demonstrate the ability of linked data to establish associations that may lead to the identification of &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot;, subgroup specific issues, enabling strategies etc. The impact will be useful new intelligence, informing policy across Wales and beyond.

Objective 3. Developing a better understanding of migration patterns linked to social deprivation, will be of use in any research that compares variations by socio-economic status. These are widely used, and often in the context of measuring inequalities. The new knowledge provided by this work will have an impact on the understanding of inequalities within Wales, but findings will be of use to researchers wherever such indices are utilised.

Objective 4. Comparing identical data items, as recorded in different data sets, is important in driving up data quality and developing a better understanding of the information. Validation of self reported WHS data, for example, against service utilisation, introduces a new level of understanding of validity in such surveys. There is an impact locally: It may be shown that we have redundancy in certain data collections, so that savings can be made. There is a broader research outcome from generalising how self reported items compare to routinely measured data. 

The underlying objective is developing a better joint understanding of data linkage, the far reaching impact will be the creation of new intelligence from better utilisation of existing routinely collected data. This will better inform policy makers and provide a rich source for both acedemic and business development research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47512</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project demonstrated to policy makers at Welsh Government the power of data linkage in enhancing the knowledge base from which policy decisions are made. This was achieved through the development of three demonstration projects, 1. enhancing existing evaluation of an early childhood intervention, 2. Examining the impact of home efficiency improvements on health, and 3. Comparing patient pathways of people with multiple chronic health conditions</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Further work to support the main evaluation of the early years intervention is funded and being carried out by the Adminstrative Data Research Network (ADRN) Swansea. Arrangements have been put in place to anonymise the actual participants in Flying Start for more accurate results to be created on educational outcomes up to school leaving age.
2. Funding has been created to support a PhD and a research analyst post to deliver further research on 'fuel poverty' using linked data. This project is set to publish in March 2017. Findings will feed into work to make recommendations to WG Ministers on the future of research on housing conditions in Wales to support various policy initiatives. 
3. The demonstration project was used in a multi agency discussion leading to bid submission for the development of a stroke register. The original bid was unsuccessful, but the multi agency team is developing other bids. The work will feed into the development of the Wales Research Co-operative, a WG-led initiative to create a cohort of potential study participants for whom routine health records can be linked. As a result of all of the demonstration projects, work is ongoing within WG to develop further data linking research projects to contribute to the evidence base, particularly on complex, 'wicked', multi-causal issues such as substance misuse. 
4 The Prudent Healthcare Intelligence Hub, part of Farr Institute at Swansea University, is carrying out a stroke pathway evaluation in conjunction with the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board in Wales. Initial discussions have used the findings of the multiple chronic health conditions project and the further research will build on this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3E84731D-782D-41DA-AF42-E012C60454CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545792364f3751.71095543</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://wales.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/data-linking-demonstration-projects/?lang=en</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011428/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
