This is the great promise of a novel technology; the artificial swimming micromachine.

However, the current generation of swimming micromachines has a fundamental flaw; it is not possible to effectively control individuals within a large group. Without this precision control, it will be impossible for this technology to perform precision tasks such as targeted drug delivery.

But Nature has found myriad ways to overcome the challenge of propelling and steering microorganisms through complex environments. Inspired by Nature, this project will design swimming micromachines that can transform shape in order to perform different functions. The novel ability to transform will allow micromachines to transcend this control barrier, and realise the potential of this exciting technology.

Developing a prototype of these microtransformers is a complex task that spans traditional scientific disciplines, and will only be possible with new mathematical theories and cutting-edge materials that can be &amp;quot;programmed&amp;quot; to remember specific shapes.

The initial design to be used as a proof of concept will be a flexible filament, with both ends coated in platinum. When placed in hydrogen peroxide, the platinum will catalyse its reduction into water and oxygen, causing a flow at the surface of the filament. If the filament is straight, this flow should act as a pump, if it is bent in a &amp;quot;U&amp;quot;-shape, the filament should translate, and if bent into an &amp;quot;S&amp;quot;-shape, it should rotate. Using ultrasound to switch the filament between these preprogrammed shapes, the micromachine would then be able to navigate complex environments using a series of straight runs and on-the-spot reorientations, just like bacteria.

The project will take this novel idea, and develop new mathematical tools to model the coupled elastic, fluid, and chemical dynamics of slender filaments in order to optimise this initial design, and conceive new designs with greater functionality involving multiple filaments and ribbon-like structures. At the same time, experiments will develop a lab prototype that will be used to test and refine the theory.

By the end of the project, this prototype will be sufficiently developed to begin commercialisation of the technology for industrial use, and to begin the development of a &amp;quot;biocompatible&amp;quot; prototype for minimally-invasive medical applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will primarily generate impact in the microfluidics industry via the commercialisation of scientific knowledge, in the form of an innovative technology. This technology will be used to perform microfluidics tasks, such as cargo transport and assembly, with high precision and flexibility, granting the UK additional capabilities in this sector. UK-based companies that might exploit this technology include Ultrahaptics, Malvern Instruments, MicroSystems, Dolomite, and Epigem. The business partner on this project will benefit from enhanced revenue, as well as an expanded skills and knowledge base via close collaboration with researchers. In turn, the economy may see a number of new jobs, and beyond the project the commercial form of the technology may attract wider investment once it is developed.

In the longer term, the project will form the foundation of a biocompatible version of the technology that could be used in a clinical setting in order to facilitate minimally invasive medicine, which is associated with reduced side-effects, patient recovery times, and improved patient outcomes. Examples might be targeted drug delivery to reduce side-effects, for instance with chemotherapy, and improved IVF for patients with sperm motility problems. This will have significant benefits to patient's quality of life and well-being.

Finally, the project is ideally-themed to capture the public's imagination and bring microscale research to the fore of the public consciousness; there is a significant programme of public engagement activities designed to raise awareness and understanding of physics at microscopic scales, including public-space installations, science exhibitions, and youtube videos. This programme includes working with local artists to create micro-inspired work that will provide cultural enrichment to the wider public, as well as impacting on the practice of the artists themselves via exposure to novel scientific research ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R041555/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
