Machines</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J017728/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>SOCIAM - Social Machines - will research into pioneering methods of supporting purposeful human interaction on the World Wide Web, of the kind exemplified by phenomena such as Wikipedia and Galaxy Zoo. These collaborations are empowering, as communities identify and solve their own problems, harnessing their commitment, local knowledge and embedded skills, without having to rely on remote experts or governments.

Such interaction is characterised by a new kind of emergent, collective problem solving, in which we see (i) problems solved by very large scale human participation via the Web, (ii) access to, or the ability to generate, large amounts of relevant data using open data standards, (iii) confidence in the quality of the data and (iv) intuitive interfaces.

&amp;quot;Machines&amp;quot; used to be programmed by programmers and used by users. The Web, and the massive participation in it, has dissolved this boundary: we now see configurations of people interacting with content and each other, typified by social web sites. Rather than dividing between the human and machine parts of the collaboration (as computer science has traditionally done), we should draw a line around them and treat each such assembly as a machine in its own right comprising digital and human components - a Social Machine. This crucial transition in thinking acknowledges the reality of today's sociotechnical systems. This view is of an ecosystem not of humans and computers but of co-evolving Social Machines.

The ambition of SOCIAM is to enable us to build social machines that solve the routine tasks of daily life as well as the emergencies. Its aim is to develop the theory and practice so that we can create the next generation of decentralised, data intensive, social machines. Understanding the attributes of the current generation of successful social machines will help us build the next.

The research undertakes four necessary tasks. First, we need to discover how social computing can emerge given that society has to undertake much of the burden of identifying problems, designing solutions and dealing with the complexity of the problem solving. Online scaleable algorithms need to be put to the service of the users. This leads us to the second task, providing seamless access to a Web of Data including user generated data. Third, we need to understand how to make social machines accountable and to build the trust essential to their operation. Fourth, we need to design the interactions between all elements of social machines: between machine and human, between humans mediated by machines, and between machines, humans and the data they use and generate. SOCIAM's work will be empirically grounded by a Social Machines Observatory to track, monitor and classify existing social machines and new ones as they evolve, and act as an early warning facility for disruptive new social machines.

These lines of interlinked research will initially be tested and evaluated in the context of real-world applications in health, transport, policing and the drive towards open data cities (where all public data across an urban area is linked together) in collaboration with SOCIAM's partners. Putting research ideas into the field to encounter unvarnished reality provides a check as to their utility and durability. For example the Open City application will seek to harness citywide participation in shared problems (e.g. with health, transport and policing) exploiting common open data resources. 

SOCIAM will undertake a breadth of integrated research, engaging with real application contexts, including the use of our observatory for longitudinal studies, to provide cutting edge theory and practice for social computation and social machines. It will support fundamental research; the creation of a multidisciplinary team; collaboration with industry and government in realization of the research; promote growth and innovation - most importantly - impact in changing the direction of ICT.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed programme will have beneficial impact on a wide range of stakeholders. Via technology transfer, companies will gain access to new technologues, and also gain the understanding that will allow them to develop new products for communities organising themselves in social machines. Those companies that partner us or support our research will of course have the ability to feed ideas into the research, and frame the problems we are trying to solve; we consider it essential that fundamental research feeds into, and back from, real-world applications.

Smaller-scale entrepreneurs will have new outlets for innovation, and new opportunities to develop radical business models. The public sector and third sector will have available new tools and methods for achieving policy ends. Communities using social machines will also benefit, of course, by the ability to identify and define their own problems, and develop their own solutions. These benefits, in social cohesion and cooperation, will often outlive the immediate issue which drove the development of the social machine.

We should not forget the benefits to the wider academic community of the proposed research. Of course, the development of a community of multi-disciplinary researchers in social machines will benefit the computer science field, but via the observatory and the strong social relevance of the research, we would expect a wide academic community in science and social science benefiting from the deepening of expertise in this area, and the large quantity of data. The 5-year programme would allow a strong multi-disciplinary cohort of researchers to emerge, able to influence a range of fields, spreading expertise in these relatively novel methods of social collaboration. Dissemination will also take place via our programme of Town Meetings, sandpits, hackathons, disruptive skills workshops, etc. Groups associated with the consortium, such as the Web Science Trust, will be able to ensure that SOCIAM's work is widely disseminated and one of our Partners is the world's largest Technical PR Agency.

The impacts will be both economic and non-economic. The economic impacts will be the benefits that come from innovation and cooperation, and from bottom-up solutions to problems. These will include both lowering costs of social problems (e.g. via community policing lowering the costs of crime), and creating opportunities for innovation and commercial exploitation of innovation (as for example with the development of new services based on creative uses of available data). Some of these benefits will fall to entrepreneurs, while others will spill over into the wider community.

Furthermore, the research will enable value to be extracted from the ever-growing quantities of data we see. The social return on investment in data acquisition, particularly public open data, will be dramatically improved as more tools and methods are created for using the data to drive services.

There will be several non-economic impacts too. In policy terms, the impacts will be high, particularly as local solutions for problems - inherently more efficient than centralised problem-solving which cannot always take account of local conditions - will emerge from collaboration in social machines in small communities. Communities will become empowered and self-reliant. The result will be a suite of tools and methods which can be put to work in social contexts by a range of actors - government, to achieve policy goals, groups of people, to achieve social goals, or entrepreneurs, to achieve commercial goals. Indeed, one would expect a social machine to encompass all of these at different times.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2667741</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at JP Morgan TechFest, Bournemouth, Enabling Provenance on the Web: Standardization and Research Questions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>440C3970-8232-4F14-887D-02D80B0BF447</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enabling Provenance on the Web: Standardization and Research Questions

Provenance is a record that describes the people, institutions,
entities, and activities, involved in producing, influencing, or
delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world. 

Some 10 years after beginning research on the topic of provenance, I
co-chaired the provenance working group at the World Wide Web

2016. During those 10 years, the field of provenance has seen a
tremendous amount of development. Among the 30 events I identified, I
will highlight some successes, such as the Provenance Challenge and a

Provenance is a record that describes the people, institutions,
entities, and activities, involved in producing, influencing, or
delivering a piece of data or a thing in the world. 

Some 10 years after beginning research on the topic of provenance, I
co-chaired the provenance working group at the World Wide Web

Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing
Citizen Science: SOCIAM has had a significant impact on the Zooniverse citizen science platform. Zooniverse is the world's largest and most popular platform for citizen science, currently hosting over 50 live projects across multiple fields of research. It has tens of thousands of active volunteers worldwide, with over 1.5 million registered volunteers in total taking part throughout the last decade. SOCIAM studies and experiments have helped the Zooniverse better understand its community, looking at their motivations, structure, and behaviour. This in turn has enabled the Zooniverse to create a better platform that suits the specific needs and behaviours of their crowd. 
Data Citation: Our paper on data citation was made the lead article in CACM (September 2016) and the proposals have been partly implemented in two curated databases.

Health Social Machines
We have worked closely with clinical teams in the NHS and applied our methodology to help them record and rethink their patient pathways and social interactions. Our most notable collaborations are the following:
- Modelling HIV care pathways in collaboration with the sexual health care team at NHS Lothian.
- Workflow modelling for the care of burns in Scotland in collaboration with the Care Of Burns In Scotland (COBIS) network.
- Designing a social machine for the Heart Manual Service, which is led by NHS Lothian and delivered by several clinical teams worldwide.
- Carrying out a practical experiment between data safe haven jurisdictions in Scotland and Trentino.

Machine Intelligence and the Mind of Society
Some informal collaboration has occurred with IBM UK to explore the implications of the work into digital immortality, data cryogenics, neuromorphic computing and sentient machines.

Provenance and Annotation
The initial driver for this work was the Human Brain project, with which the findings were shared.
https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/

Supporting Privacy and End-User Data Management Social Machines
On the basis of the X-Ray work, we are launching an Ethical Data Pledge, to encourage developers to create apps which respect privacy and data ethics. We are also aiming to share the results of our large scale measurement with data protection and competition regulators to help inform their activities with respect to third party tracking.

Our work on curation of online identity through deception was featured on a BBC Radio 4 Programme, &amp;quot;The Online Identity Crisis&amp;quot;, which first aired on Sunday 11 September 2016, and later twice on 9 December 2016. Two SOCIAM senior research fellows, Max Van Kleek and Dave Murray-Rust, were interviewed in the programme as online identity privacy experts in the context of the WebSci paper on online identity discussed above.

The key findings from our analysis have been published as a full article in the December 2016 issue of &amp;quot;Inspired Research&amp;quot;, a magazine that is edited and published twice a year by the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, to showcase world leading research outcomes from the department, for the general public. 

Our work has also drawn interest from the Oxford University, and been invited to be part of the first ever Oxford University European Researcher's Night, to take place on 25th September 2017. European Researchers' Night is a Europe-wide celebration of academic research for the public, supported by the European Commission. This will be a city-wide public-facing celebration of research happening at the University. The event aims to seek to engage a diverse audience through activities such as live experiments, debates, bite-sized talks and other activities. A six month digital and media engagement campaign will lead up to the event, and the university aims to reach over 100,000 public audience before the event and attract over 10K public visitors on the night of the event.

Work on privacy theory also informed the Global Commission on Internet Governance, chaired by Carl Bildt, and commissioned by the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) and Chatham House in response to trends toward fragmentation of the Internet, with the aim of offering guidance on how to address new challenges as they emerge. SOCIAM researchers produced a chapter on the implementation of the controversial Google Spain/right to be forgotten decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Papers in the Data Protection Law review and IEEE Internet Computing extended the arguments.

The INDX Data platform, was demonstrated at various venues, including the ReDecentralise Conference in 2015 in London, and to the W3C at MIT CSAIL. The INDX repository has been cloned over 200 times, forked 7 times and is being watched by 25 individuals, and has now been registered in the project of Alternative Internets.

Social Machine and Web Observatory
The Web Observatory has become the core platform for many of the SOCIAM observational studies performed across several themes. The underlying data streaming architecture has powered the Web macroscope, which has had direct impact to the non-academic community. We have run several public engagement activities interested in interpreting and analysing big data and social machine activity.
The development of the Web Observatory schema.org extension has contributed to the development of services outside the SOCIAM projects, included organisations such as the Library of Congress, where services have been built in order to enrich and improve discoverability of their dataset and archives. We have also been working with other institutes such as Stanford in order to enrich institute data.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EBC24379-0162-4717-AD50-1B109F5F61DC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca80bb086184.39442327</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Key Findings of our research are set out below under 10 headings. The original research proposal was organised around 6 themes:
Theme 1: Social Computation
Theme 2: Curated Data and Social Computation
Theme 3: Privacy, Accountability and Trust
Theme 4: Interaction
Theme 5: Social Machines Implementations
Theme 6: Social Machine Observatory

Under the 10 headings to follow, we have indicated which of the above themes the research outputs fall under.

1. Classification of Social Machines [Themes 1, 4, 5]
Knowledge elicitation techniques were adapted to support the conceptual analysis and categorization of social machines. As a result of this analysis, a taxonomic framework of social machines was developed. This framework consists of a number of dimensions and associated features that define the total space of design possibilities for social machines.
Subsequent classification work has focused on a specific class of social machines, dubbed knowledge machines. Knowledge machines are social machines that yield epistemic outputs. A particularly important class of knowledge machines are citizen science systems and online games that support the process of scientific discovery.

2. Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing [Themes 1, 2, 5]
2.1 Citizen Science
We have been leading several research streams with regards to the observation and analysis of citizen science platforms on the Web. We have been working with our project partner, Zooniverse, and our external collaborators, Eyewire (Princeton, US), in order to run several studies and experiments within the space of citizen science. This work has led to recent publications in several top-tier conferences including CHI (Tinati, 2015), CSCW (Reeves, 2017), ICWSM (Tinati, 2017), and Web Science (Tinati, 2016), as well as publications in journals, including Computers in Human Behaviour (Tinati, 2017). The work contributes to SOCIAM's overall aim of understanding the human component in social machines, both from a community aspect (e.g. social communications and interactions), to an engagement perspective, which included the large-scale analysis of user behaviour. 
We have also been leading on research activities involving the development of several observational dashboards (linked to the Social Machines Web Observatory platform) which will be used by members of the Zooniverse team in order to observe and manage their community. The work is intended to contribute to current research activities which study how research teams manage and interact with their team.

2.2 Crowdsourcing
Beyond citizen science, we have been exploring the effects of motivation, incentives, and task design in contexts that use other forms of crowdsourcing, in particular paid microtask platforms. We looked at ways to make paid crowdsourcing more effective and rewarding for the people involved by testing how gamification enhances crowd experience. This work led to a publication at the WWW Conference in 2015 - we developed a gamified paid crowdsourcing platform, which was more effective than traditional paid crowdsourcing with respect to the volume of work completed by the crowd and with respect to the feedback received from the workers. We also studied the effect of different furtherance incentives related to game mechanics (additional rewards, feedback on task performance, feedback on performance compared to others) have on retention. As a follow-up of this work, we started experimenting with other models of crowdsourcing on the same gamified platform. In an article accepted for publication in the ACM TIST journal, we study how collaborative microtasks compare with traditional, individual task designs and how social incentives enabled by collaboration (social flow, social pressure) affect retention. A second line of research studied categories of tasks relevant to data management and curation. In an article published in the Semantic Web Journal we proposed different types of workflows to improve the performance of existing entity classification algorithms. At Semantics 2014 and ESWC2015 we presented experiments that investigated how specific task parameters in named entity recognition tasks change crowd performance and behaviour. Finally, in a second article in the Semantic Web Journal we proposed a workflow using contests and paid microtasks which can accurately repair the quality of some of the most critical data quality issues in DBpedia.

2.3 Data Citation
Citation is essential to traditional scholarship. Citations identify the cited material, help retrieve it, give credit to the creator of the material, date it, and so on. In the context of printed materials, such as books and journals, citation is well understood. However, the world is now digital. Most of our scholarly and scientific resources are held online and many are in some kind of crowd-sourced, or better expert-sourced, database, i.e. a structured, evolving collection of data. For example, most biological reference works have been replaced by curated databases, and vast amounts of basic scientific data - geospatial, astronomical, molecular, etc. - are now available online. There is strong demand that we should accord the same scholarly status to these databases and cite them appropriately, but how can we do this effectively? Data citation is an interesting computational challenge, whose solution draws on several well-studied problems in database theory: query answering using views, and provenance. We describe the problem, suggest a practical approach to its solution, and highlight several open research problems.

3. Lightweight Social Calculus [Themes 1, 4, 5]
We'd like to change the way in which social machines are built. The central premise is: there is a model of interaction which sits behind any social machine, governing who can do what when, which kinds of messages can be sent and to whom, shaping the ways in which the complex socio-technical system unfolds through time. However, these interaction models are often not explicit, transparent, editable, discoverable, composable and so on, as they are scattered through many interacting pieces of code. In response, we are looking at a way to create social computation systems by starting with an interaction model, allowing all of the other components of a modern, large scale interactive system to be organised around a representation of the communication and coordination which takes place.
In order to explore this space, a modified version of the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC) is used, termed the Lightweight Social Calculus (LSC). It is an executable, declarative process calculus for interactions between heterogeneous agents. Use of LSC is based on the enactment of protocols, which give a minimally intrusive framework for defining patterns of communication without overly constraining the internal knowledge and decision making architecture of the actors involved.
There are several motivations for doing this:
i. Since protocols can be mechanically enacted, they provide the potential for mixed initiative human computer interaction and human computation applications. Creating a protocol which represents human interaction allows computational agents to join in on an equal footing with the humans.
ii. Making protocols first class objects allows for their exchange and manipulation. It means that communities can discover interactions which suit their needs and adopt them, after making any modifications necessary.
iii. Protocols can be transparent to users, indicating what the bounds and rules of the interactions are, leading to a greater facility for understanding the implications of engaging. This does, of course, on being able to represent the protocols in a manner which makes sense to users.
iv. There is a clear separation of concerns between the structure of the interac- tion and the mediums and communities where it is enacted. The interaction can then be framed in a manner which is most appropriate to the community in question, and integrated into their existing practice by connecting the in- teraction model with the technical platforms already in use - essentially, the interaction becomes key, rather than the substrate on which it is performed.
v. A protocol is amenable to formal techniques. For example, properties can be verified, such as the flow of data through the interaction, termination criteria, and other qualities which relate to privacy and security.

In order for this to work, humans need some way to engage with protocols as they are enacted. One mechanism for doing this is to create an interface with which people can engage, whether through webpages or mobile devices, or mediated through APIs of some sort. This is the means of engagement with which we're familiar from earlier LCC work. Another possibility is to find a way to run the protocols alongside existing interaction, annotating their behaviour with formal structures. We call this approach 'Soft Institutions', where the formal edges of electronic institutions are softened to provide natural, human ways for people to engage with them.
LSC is a declarative, executable specification designed to give enough structure to manage fully distributed interactions by coordinating message passing and the roles which actors play, while leaving space for the actors to make their own decisions. It is derived from LCC with extensions designed to make it more amenable to mixed human-machine interactions; in practice, this means having language elements which cover user input, external computation or database lookup and storing knowledge and state. 
An LSC protocol consists of a set of clauses. Each clause is composed of a role specification and a description of what an agent should do when playing that role (which we call the body of the clause). The body contains message sending (M ? a(role,ID)) and receiving (M ? a(role,ID)), sequencing and choice (then and or), implication (action ? condition), the assumption of new roles (a(role, ID)) and any extra computation or conditions necessary, including accessing environmental artifacts.
When computing with LSC, each agent joins the interaction by taking on one of the roles specified, and taking the clause given by that role as its initial state. The state is then repeatedly re-written in response to incoming events: incoming messages are matched against expected messages, role definitions are replaced with the body of matching clauses, values are substituted for variables and so on. As the interaction progresses, this state tree keeps a complete history of the agents' actions and communications. This supports the creation of multi-agent institutions where interaction is guided by shared protocols and a substrate which keeps track of state.
There are a couple of applications that demonstrate how LSC advances the state of the art:
i. We present models and techniques for coordination of human workers in crowdsourced software development environments. We combine the Social Compute Unit - a model of ad-hoc human worker teams - with versatile coordination protocols expressed in LSC. This allows us to combine coordination and quality constraints with dynamic assessments of end-user desires, dynamically discovering and applying development protocols.
ii. The vast majority of human (and, increasingly, automated) social interaction is now taking place in social media systems where social norms are soft concepts regulated essentially by the people involved. Being able to leverage the power of electronic institutions in these systems would ease the application of computational intelligence in support of social tasks. We describe a method by which electronic institutions can act in synergy with these sorts of social media streams and, in doing so, we define a &amp;quot;softer'' style of system that, nevertheless, retains connection to precise specifications of coordination. In addition, we question the tacit assumption that participating agents deliberately join appropriate institutions. Although our method is independent of choice of social media stream (given a few standard characteristics of these) we have an implementation of the method using Twitter as a target media stream.

In addition, we are investigating in ongoing work the use of LSC as part of a design methodology for Social Machines. Ideally, new social machines could be described by their users' interaction protocols, and prototype infrastructure could automatically be generated from these interaction protocols. 
The current research focuses on identifying simple protocols that can be used as building blocks and composed to form complex social machines. We then aim to produce a tool with which non-expert users could design social machines using a graphical language, and from which prototype infrastructure could be automatically generated. 
Our tentative solution involves a hypergraph where nodes are actors and hyperedges are interaction protocols, and the open research questions include the following: Can we describe (most) social machines with such structures? Do we need additional constructs, and if so, with which semantics? Can a working prototype be automatically generated from such a structure? and if not, then what additional constraints apply? What additional information is needed?

4. Health Social Machines [Themes 1, 4, 5]
4.1 Formal Modelling of Care Pathways
We have worked towards developing formal models of care that capture the necessary sequence of steps for effective patient care. Integrate Care Pathways (ICPs) are a prime example of such models. 
Using process modelling tools, such as WorkflowFM and the Lightweight Social Calculus, we created formal, structured models that enable the following key activities:
i. An intuitive, diagrammatic visualisation of the care pathways which helps clinicians better understand their own practices, analyse and rethink them.
ii. The use of a structured data model facilitates the recording and versioning of these models so that they can be more easily maintained and evolved as policies and practices change. They can also be shared amongst the different stakeholders to enable collaborative development, as well as across sites for a fruitful comparison.
iii. Formal verification techniques can be applied on our models to mechanically check their correctness and consistency. This can help eliminate errors, increase the trustworthiness of the model, and improve patient safety.
iv. Executable code (including, for example, workflow automation and generated checklists) can be extracted from these models to form an optimised social machine for healthcare provision. 

Capturing and recording care pathways is itself a social process. Our work has resulted in a rigorous, collaborative methodology for the formal modelling of care pathways, from the collection of data from all the involved stakeholders to an optimised, executable support system that enhances clinical coordination and care practices. 
In short, we believe process-based workflow models can be an effective methodology to document and share care pathways provided they are developed in close collaboration with clinical stakeholders. 

4.2 Designing a Social Machine for the Heart Manual Service
In addition to our ICP modelling work, we have investigated suitable methods for designing social machines in a healthcare context. We have studied the case of a social machine for the clinical facilitators of the Heart Manual Programme, which is a home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme. Requirements were elicited through various participatory design methods and a proof of concept evaluation was carried out with a prototype. The prototype was received largely positively and scored highly on the system usability scale, indicating the success of the proposed methodology. This work suggests that adopting a participatory approach where stakeholders are active, equal participants throughout the design process leads to a more usable, likeable, and thus more successful social machine.

4.3 Data Safe Havens
Generic methods for sharing data in secure infrastructures are necessary for sharing healthcare data. The potential of medical and healthcare data to support the sorts of extensive, data-intensive experiments being demanded by precision and stratified medicine is a long way from being realised. A key architectural problem remaining to be solved is how to maintain control of patient data within the governance of local data jurisdictions, while also allowing these jurisdictions to engage with experiment designs that (because of the need to scale to large population sizes) may require analyses across several jurisdictions. Our study provides a snapshot of architectural work underway to provide a clear, effective structure of data safe havens within jurisdictions. We investigate how formally specified experiment designs can be used to enable jurisdictions to work together on experiments that no single jurisdiction could tackle alone. Our work relates to two jurisdictions (in Scotland and in Italy), but the architecture and methods are general across similar jurisdictions.

4.4 Use of Quantified Self Data in Clinical Practice
The pervasiveness of wearable devices and apps for sensing and automatically capturing aspects relating to people's health and wellbeing have caused a rise in self-logging of such data. However, no work has yet considered the challenges of introducing this data into clinical workflows. This work comprises work with clinical cardiologists and other clinical care providers to understand opportunities and challenges that the use of self-logged data might pose. Key findings of this work include the following:

- Data quality poses substantial challenges for admitting QS data into certain kinds of clinical use, including differential diagnosis; however, may be suitable for subjective assessments of symptomatic burden and other longitudinal care needs
- Representations of this QS data are highly non-standardised, and this presents a barrier to clinical use
- QS data remain highly fragmented, and voluminous, which presents a barrier to their effective use because interpretation of this data can require time
- QS data often represent dimensions of patient wellbeing that are not typically measured or considered during clinical workflows and this presents a challenge to effective interpretation

Nonetheless there were several potential avenues which showed promise, including for longitudinal symptom burden assessment and management.

5. Machine Intelligence and the Mind of Society [Themes 1, 2, 4, 6]
We have explored the various ways in which social machines are relevant to the development of machine-based cognitive capabilities. This includes the idea that the Internet provides an important form of cognitive contact with the human social environment - one that provides a rich range of learning and socialization opportunities. This work dovetails with work in developmental psychology and cognitive robotics.
A second aspect of work in this area relates to the notion of human-extended machine cognition. This is a new concept in the philosophy of mind that maintains that the human social environment can form part of the material fabric that realizes certain kinds of machine-based cognizing. The notion of human-extended machine cognition is relevant to SOCIAM in the sense that social machines support the possibility that human individuals could form part of the extended realization base for advanced forms of machine intelligence. 
Another strand of work concerns the notion of social computation. The terms 'social computation' and 'crowd computation' are currently popular within computer science; however, the systems to which these terms are applied reveal a tension with the philosophical conception of computation. The upshot is that either the notion of social computation is inadmissible, or that the philosophical conception of computation needs to be revised. Either way, we can begin to see how the the philosophical analysis of social computation is poised to impact theoretical discourses in multiple disciplines.
Finally, we have expanded the theoretical terrain of the sciences of the mind by developing the concept of the 'mind of society'. In particular, we have developed a theoretical proposal for a form of machine intelligence that is grounded in the monitoring of social processes. The idea draws inspiration from recent research in theoretical neuroscience and research into deep learning systems. In particular, we suggest that the attempt to develop a generative model of social processes provides the sufficient basis for a form of experientially-potent machine-based cognition.

6. Provenance and Annotation [Themes 2, 3]
Analysis of social media data is now central to many decision making processes, which results in complex data processing and integration pipelines, often incorporating components from several sources. In this scenario, traceability of data across analytics pipelines is important both for the data providers' and the consumer's perspective. While the parties involved in the data analytics process are interested in assessing quality, reproducibility, and quality of the outcome of an analysis, the data provider(s), e.g. users of a social network, may want to have some guarantees about how their data is being used. In a paper, Peter Buneman, Adria Gascon and Luc Moreau draw attention to the general problem of combining provenance collected across systems, and we show through an example how a basic method of augmenting the provenance of communicating systems allows us to provide answers to questions about the movement of data and the attribution of responsibility to agents. This work is being used by Dong Huynh to incorporate provenance in the SOCIAM Web Observatory.

7. Supporting Privacy and End-User Data Management in Social Machines [Themes 3, 4]
7.1 Privacy Data Controller Indicators (App X-Rays)
Smartphone apps currently leak personal information of many forms and types to a variety of destinations, including first and third parties, for a similarly varied set of purposes. Some of these purposes are critical for providing the service, whilst others include advertising and analytics. 
End-users are seldom aware of exactly how these information are disclosed, with whom they are disclosed, and for what purposes. This causes a number of problems, including heightened anxiety by end-users about potential misuse of data by apps and services, and an inability to reason about how and whether particular apps or services are &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; to use in accordance with their privacy preferences.
This work aims to help end-users make better informed privacy decisions by making the hidden information flows embedded within and behind social machines visible, in particular smartphone and web applications. We first used several approaches to measure these hidden information disclosure activities, including dynamic approaches (intercepting network traffic), and static ones (e.g. static analysis of disassembled compiled binaries), we identify first and third party entities who gather personal data via applications. We then designed a series of visual interfaces to represent this information to users, to explore their privacy concerns and information management needs. We also conducted large-scale analysis of the third party trackers associated with the 5,000 most popular Android applications and 5,000 websites, in order to understand the concentration of power in the tracker ecosystem.
Key findings:
- Our visual representations of these hidden information flows from smartphone apps allowed individuals to make more nuanced, contextually-informed, and confident decisions
- The third party tracking market, in both the web and mobile ecosystems, is concentrated in the hands of a small number of firms; by mapping parent-subsidiary relationships we were also able to measure the impact of market consolidation in recent years.

7.2 Privacy Languages
Privacy remains a primary concern for most users of web and smartphone apps. Despite numerous efforts, users remain powerless in controlling how their personal information should be used and by whom, and find limited options to actually opt-out of dominating service providers, who often process users information with limited transparency or respect for their privacy preferences. Privacy languages are designed to express the privacy-related preferences of users and the practices of organisations, in order to establish a privacy-preserved data handling protocol. However, in practice there has been limited adoption of these languages, by either users or data controllers. 
This work focused on understanding the strengths and limitations of existing policy languages. The preliminary results showed that exist languages focused on enabling control for organisations, but lack a focus on normal web users and on enabling their control over actual data resources. This laid down the groundwork for our next step privacy protection designs that aim to be centred around web users for empowering their control of data privacy.
Also under this heading, SOCIAM looked at understandings of privacy and divergent privacy discourses, and the difficulties these have created for interpreting privacy as single idea or ideal, and therefore on the problems created for determining privacy policies. Seven different types of privacy discourse, ranging from the conceptual to political, moral and rights-based discourse, were outlined. Work is ongoing to employ the framework as a means for situating privacy discourses and design, and some of its ideas were employed to evaluate the recent Google Spain/Right to be Forgotten ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (see in impact section). A paper is in train, and a shorter version appeared in IEEE Internet Computing in 2016.

7.3 Self Curation Online
This study, comprising a set of interviews of active social media users, sought to understand tensions faced by individuals to provide personally-identifying information online, and the strategies that they used to cope with such demands. Many reasons are found for people fabricating their data (e.g. providing false information), including creative expression, hiding sensitive information, role-playing, and avoiding harassment or discrimination. The results suggest lying is often used for benign purposes, and we conclude that its use may be essential strategy for people to maintain their privacy in an era which incentivises companies to ask for as much personal data as possible. 

7.4 Pro-Social Deception
The pervasiveness of smart devices and sensing, whilst bringing potential benefits, also poses considerable threats to personal autonomy. This experiment looks at future personal sensing tools that give people &amp;quot;space to deceive&amp;quot;, and even that facilitate or automate deception to give people the ability to regain their autonomy. Using a speculative fictions methodology, we asked people to reflect on several sketches of fictional tools (called the lieCloud or liePhone suite) that used automated deception to help individuals preserve their privacy. The results revealed many people were open to many pro-social uses of such tools.

7.5 Fairness and accountability in data use
In addition to examining aspects of privacy, we also explored questions of algorithmic fairness, accountability and transparency regarding the downstream use of data gathered through social machines. A set of alternative institutional and technical arrangements were proposed for privacy-preserving forms of data-driven discrimination analysis, and a philosophical analysis of algorithmic transparency was developed in terms of the political notion of public reason.

7.6 Personal Data Stores
Based on the user needs requirements analysis, and vision we described in &amp;quot;The Future of Data is Personal&amp;quot; and designed and developed a personal data store platform called INDX capable of negotiating, retrieving and communicating using Linked Data, including LDP, which was demonstrated at a number of different forums, which we published as FOSS software in the SOCIAM GitHub repository. 

8. Ethics [Themes 1, 3, 4]
Ethics has emerged as a lateral theme throughout the SOCIAM project and has gained increasing traction over time. The topic intersects with all of the main themes of the programme, but particularly with &amp;quot;Privacy, Accountability and Trust&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Interaction&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Social Computation&amp;quot;. Ethical behaviour is also a key 'social' dimension of social machines. 
The ethics theme has influenced the development of several research outputs by SOCIAM staff, including published articles, conference papers, research reports and online commentaries focusing in particular on trust, deception and governance of digital social spaces and algorithms. Synergies between the engineering and social/policy dimension of SOCIAM have also given rise to opportunities for social machine innovation which are currently being explored, such as the development of 'ethical bots' as a means of mining the Terms and Conditions underpinning online services, social platforms or apps that could be characterized as social machines.
The ethics theme also benefits from synergies with related projects in which members of SOCIAM are involved; notably the 'responsible innovation' theme of the Smart Societies project and aspects of ethics, governance and public involvement surrounding RCUK's medical and administrative 'Big Data' data initiatives. 

9. Social Machine and Web Observatory [Themes 5, 6]
The development of the Web Observatory has become a core platform and a set of associated technologies in order to support the observation, analysis, and visualisation of social machine activity. Drawing together existing Web standards and recent advances in big data technologies (e.g. Storm) have been central to the development of our tools.
 At the core of the Social Machine Observatory is the Web Observatory platform which orchestrates several components for data ingestion, integration, storage, and streaming. The platform, which is part of a multi-site network of Social Machines observatories, allows for social machine researchers to capture and share data on the Web, and to reuse this data to build analytical applications and visualisations. Furthermore, the network of Web Observatories allows for multi-institute data querying and access.
There have been several research contributions during the development of the Web Observatory platform, including methods for data integration and re-streaming in real-time, and methods for data storage and retrieval in the context of collecting large scale social Web data. We have also been working several other institutes including RPI (USA) in order to establish the Web Observatory Schema.org Metadata schema, which is an extension of the widely used data metadata vocab.
 We have also been developing a distributed Web Observatory crawler and search engine which enables data discovery across multiple Web Observatory services, or content which has been described using the Schema.org Web Observatory vocab.
 Another research stream which has become a core contribution to the SOCIAM toolkit is the development of the Web Macroscope, a research project which investigates methods to map and visualise multiple streams of Web data. Underpinned by the streaming architecture of the Web Observatory, the Macroscope was developed as a multi-screen hardware solution which uses Web-based visualisations in order to provide context to several of the curated social data streams, such as Instagram, Twitter, Wikipedia, and the Zooniverse. This has been used in several and experiments, including the recent public engagement exercise at the London Science, which involved a study of how individuals engage and understand data the production of data on the Web. The work on public engagement has also been supported by a grant from the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) in order to investigate the level of public awareness of how data can be collected and used from human activity on the Web.
As an extension of the Web Observatory and Macroscope research activities, Dr Ramine Tinati and Dr Markus Luczak Roesch were awarded a grant from the Lloyds Foundation in order to research novel techniques for analysing Web data. This work contributed to a set of analytical tools available for use on the Web Observatory infrastructure.
The Web Observatory has also been critical in supporting the joint research activities between KAIST and the University of Southampton on disaster management studies. SOCIAM researchers and investigators have been involved in several workshops and joint projects which use the Web Observatory infrastructure and datasets. 
The Web Observatory platform is also being extended to as an infrastructure to support sharing of IoT datasets and analytical applications for EPSRC's PETRAS project. The extended &amp;quot;IoT Platform&amp;quot; will enable the various PETRAS academic and user-partners to share and reuse the datasets collected from empirical studies of IoT stakeholders and the high velocity streaming sensor data for research and implementation analysis. The platform supports metadata standards proposed by the Hypercat consortia based in the UK. One of the projects within PETRAS, which is looking at cyber risk assessment in coupled systems, builds directly on the experiences of SOCIAM and uses social machines as an analytic lens.
The Digital Humanities Oxford Summer School, which is the largest event of its type outside North America, introduced a new week-long workshop strand in 2016 under the banner of &amp;quot;social humanities&amp;quot;. This theme, which is running again in 2017, draws on SOCIAM and directly engages SOCIAM researchers. The intersection of sociam with humanities has proven to be mutually beneficial, with humanities methods being adopted in our analysis of social machines.

10. SOCIAM Students [Themes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
There are currently six doctoral students associated with the SOCIAM Project. Their research topics and progress to date are outlined below.
10.1 Ulrik Lyngs (Oxford)
Topic: Social Machines and Attention Management
ICT users navigate a complex landscape of social machines. However, many users say that they get distracted by the large amounts of functionality that are perpetually available to them. Moreover, many social machines like Facebook and YouTube explicitly compete to find the most efficient ways to capture users' attention. As a result, there is a rapidly growing market for 'anti-distraction tools' that people use to e.g. block out distracting functionality, tweak interfaces to reward or punish certain behaviours, or obtain statistics on how they use their devices. These tools include apps and browser plugins like Newsfeed Eradicator, RescueTime, and Forest, and in combination have millions of users. However, we do not know how these tools influence actual user behaviour, which is the focus of my research.
Progress: I have conducted initial experimental studies on how performance in simple cognitive tasks is affected by presence of smartphone. I am planning further experimental studies that will compare how task switching during ICT use is influenced by use of popular and potential anti-distraction tools. This will involve longitudinal tracking of actual usage of smartphones and laptops, as well as eye-tracking studies in a lab setting.
Outputs to date: My paper 'It's More Fun With My Phone: A replication study of cell phone presence and task performance' has been accepted for the Student Research Competition at the CHI 2017 conference in May, and will afterwards be archived in the ACM Digital Library (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3027063.3048418).
I have a related position paper, 'Curiosity, ICTs, and Attention Management' accepted for the Curiosity in Design workshop at CHI 2017, which will be presented as a poster.

10.2 Frode Hegland (Southampton)
Topic: Augmenting the social machine of academic document interaction and lifecycle
Progress: In the process of literature review and writing 9 month report. Project is outlined on frodehegland.com/phd.html and blogged at wordpress.liquid.info. Organising the 7th annual Future of Text Symposium for investigation into this space, to be hosted at the University of Southampton September 2017 thefutureoftext.org
Outputs to date: Produced software prototypes for testing to generate further insights into real needs and effectiveness.

10.3 Gatis Mikelsons (Oxford)
Topic: Science as social machine, challenges in the technological age
Progress: Identified three potential areas of research, surveyed key literature, made contacts in the research community, grown competence in cutting edge implementations of machine learning and NLP
Outputs to date: My first year is primarily taught - we aim to develop a smaller research project surveying public medical data as an applied study in machine learning. This has relevance for the public-health-related component of SOCIAM.

10.4 Michal Hoffman (Southampton)
Topic: Blockchain for Democracy: improving social transparency and openness with distributed ledger technologies, using blockchains to foster spending accountability and verifiable wealth distribution insights. The main focus is on non-financial blockchain applications in democracy and governance contexts with a keen interest in analysing policy discourses related to distributed technologies
Progress and outputs: Started March 2017, working on classifying blockchains and distributed ledger technologies, planning to collaborate on the CreaBlock initiative for asset tracking and money flow transparency in the creative industry. You can also follow my progress on http://deblocracy.eu .

10.5 Henry Story (Southampton)
Topic: Co-operating systems for decentralised secure privacy preserving social networks (project page: http://co-operating.systems/ ), build on W3C Standards, W3C community work, and research done at MIT's Distributed Information Group. The aim is to build a stack of protocols and libraries that make it easy to build Linked Data apps that integrate distributed access control.
Progress: I have been building on work I contributed to over the past 10 years at the W3C, including WebID Authentication and Authorization protocols detailed at https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/ and the W3C Linked Data Platform recommendation https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/ (2015). This includes a server and client implementation (rww-play and react-foaf) available in Open Source at https://github.com/read-write-web/ of the SoLiD specification https://github.com/solid/ which explains how these specifications can be put together (Social Linked Data) project at MIT to which I have contributed regularly.
Outputs to date: Currently researching mathematical/logical tools to be able to prove the strength of the linked data based security mechanism used in SoLiD, in order to extend them, make them more reliable.

10.6 Philip Sheldrake (Southampton)
Topic: Networked Agency. Seeking to define personal agency in the digital age, and developing normative architecture to maintain or enhance it. Framed in terms of agencement, trust, privacy, and decentralised and distributed technological architectures.
URL: http://www.philipsheldrake.com/research/ 
Progress and outputs: Literature review spanning sociology, privacy, and human-computer interaction.

In particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.

PROV is a set of W3C specifications defining a model, corresponding serializations and other supporting definitions to enable the inter-operable interchange of provenance information in heterogeneous environments such as the Web.
