One important outcome is the availability of mask-based systems not only in our labs but also at Elettra, Diamond and the ESRF (for what concerns our collaborators), plus other labs worldwide e.g. the Universities of Houston and Saskatchewan and soon the FDA and possibly DESY in Hamburg, Germany; considering that out technology is very young we expect this to keep growing in the near future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5453b03c7a7153.06214212-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creatv Microtech has fabricated for free a number of test structures, which we used in several experiments. In one occasions, they have invited me over at their expenses and showed me their facilities, which enabled a much better understanding of the mask fabrication process and especially of what can and cannot be done with the technology. They have also brokered contacts with the FDA (wit which the terms of a collaboration are under discussion which, if successful, will result in their endorsement of our technology) and with the Frederick Cancer Institute, again a very valuable contact for future collaborations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creatv Microtech has fabricated most of the masks we have used so far in our edge-illuminaiton approach. I have effectively opened a new line of business for them, since other groups have ordered similar devices since. I have visited them in two occasions and held lectures to explain how we use the masks and why, which culminated in meetings aimed at improving the mask fabrication process. The first iteration has already taken place resulting in masks with less defects and better gold/substrate adhesion; another is imminent which will be aimed at the fabrication of masks with larger areas.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>PIXIRAD Imaging Counters</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>pixirad</gtr:description><gtr:id>16CAB694-BDC5-472F-840C-AA072F6C96CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Despite this collaboration having only started very recently (contacts started in 2013 but the first experiment was carried out in 2014), we have already published a joint paper and submitted a large EU grant application.

Hence this time was used by the student to familiarise with the new methods and learn how to use the tools of the trade. In this sense, this has so far been successful and it can be said that, up to this point, the objectives have been met. We have run the first experiments with energy-sensitive detectors (data analysis is underway), and the student has developed a portable system for edge-illuminaiton based x-ray phase contrast imaging, which will enable us to perform experiments outside of our labs. This will multiply options to experiment with the technology with many more different detector (as well as source) technologies. The system has been tested and used to produce the first images, which has also provided an excellent learning curve for the student.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The portable system will enable us to perform experiments with different detector technologies (e.g. we have already tested Pixirad and are planning to include Hexitec as well as Medipix as initially foreseen), hence creating new options for collaboration between communities and widening the range of applications for both the detector and the imaging technologies. In addition we will test the imaging method on new sources (a test at Strathclyde is already planned for early next year, and discussions are underway to perform tests at the laser centre at RAL) again fostering collaborations among diverse communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C54CBC7C-0829-4FF1-81E8-CC14A03ADCB1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5452792c0843e6.00690287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Electronics,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>91ADE37A-CE60-473A-B943-42BF198E1E7F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A laboratory based edge-illumination x-ray phase-contrast imaging setup with two-directional sensitivity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a8b4ba69386fc220659c47987b8c4f7d"><gtr:id>a8b4ba69386fc220659c47987b8c4f7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kallon G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0003-6951</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56c757c27a3f93.23228671</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>534D35AF-8F39-4AA3-B6FD-C55235F5325C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Achromatic approach to phase-based multi-modal imaging with conventional X-ray sources.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/366b7f0e5b3c555881089680fe5a3074"><gtr:id>366b7f0e5b3c555881089680fe5a3074</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Endrizzi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d48c887c121.02849055</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5BE1A791-FDB9-4D6B-B6B4-3556B1C469E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Laboratory-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging with misaligned optical elements</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/366b7f0e5b3c555881089680fe5a3074"><gtr:id>366b7f0e5b3c555881089680fe5a3074</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Endrizzi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675eeb35bc9a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7651C5F5-D8DB-4E6D-8D83-FC8948375164</gtr:id><gtr:title>Note: Design and realization of a portable edge illumination X-ray phase contrast imaging system.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Review of scientific instruments</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47e4c512b9bdf10c5dfff0e75f34dc8f"><gtr:id>47e4c512b9bdf10c5dfff0e75f34dc8f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Basta D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0034-6748</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56c757075109a3.78678857</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/L502662/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
