These are mathematical functions that predict how well chemical compounds will act as drugs. QSARs are used to guide the synthesis of new drugs.

The current situation is:
1) There is a vast range of approaches to learning QSARs.
2) It is clear from theory and practice that the best QSAR approach depends on the type of problem.
3) Currently the QSAR scientist has little to guide her/him on which QSAR approach to choose for a specific problem. 

We therefore propose to make a step-change in QSAR research. We will utilise newly available public domain chemoinformatic databases, and in-house datasets, to systematically run extensive comparative QSAR experiments. We will then generalise these results to learn which target-type/ compound-type/ compound-representation /learning-method combinations work best together. 

We do not propose to develop any new QSAR method. Rather, we will learn how to better apply existing QSAR methods. This approach is called &amp;quot;meta-learning&amp;quot;, using machine learning to learn about QSAR leaning. 

We will make the knowledge we learn publically available to guide and improve future QSAR learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173170</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Eindhoven University of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>OpenML</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DC27E2F-3CE2-4BD8-8BBB-13796E5E8FD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multidisciplinary, it involves researchers from biochemistry, software engineering and machine learning.

We also had an interactive (computer simulation) demonstration of drug design in which visitors could ascertain what features of a compound rendered it as a 'good' or a 'bad' drug. Both activities provoked significant interest and enthusiasm from members of the public of all ages, from 8 to 80! The robot itself sparked more general discussion about the potential uses of a robot scientist, as well as the technicalities of how it operates, whereas the computer simulated demonstration enabled those who took part to think about the characteristics looked for in drug design, which also generated much discussion. Visitor records to this specific exhibit recorded more than 3500 visitors either 'spectating' or actually 'engaging' with the scientists presenting the robot.

We anticipate that impact from this event will be long-term and on-going. For example, the event will certainly have increased public awareness as to what a Robot Scientist is capable of (i.e. it is more than just a technical operator, but is also capable of thinking like a human scientist), and we saw evidence of increased discussion around this subject between friends and families. We also anticipate increased interest in STEM subjects at secondary and higher education levels, given the curios</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>561e6f1826eb80.00763165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMIcMrzDgNc</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We worked in close collaboration with our project partners from the University of Manchester and the University of Dundee. We also established a close collaboration with the OpenML Team from the University of Technology, Eindhoven and internally, in Brunel University with Dr Crina Grosan - an expert in machine learning. Below is a summary of the key outputs.

1. Annotation scheme. We have developed an annotation scheme for the annotation of machine learning experiments that are typically used for the prediction of biological activities of chemical compounds. The annotation scheme consists of descriptors for datasets, machine learners, their predictions and also drag targets. While several formalisms for the description of datasets and machine learning algorithms already exist, they are generic and not tuned for the prediction of biological activities necessary for drug discovery. For example, the ontology DMOP (Data Mining Optimization), developed within the European e-LICO project (http://www.e-lico.eu/DMOP.html), is sufficient to describe such properties of a dataset as number of data items, feature correlation, etc. However DMOP and other formalism do not provide descriptors that capture information about, for example, diversity of a chemical space. There also exists a classification of drug targets (see ChEMBL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/target/browser), but it does not capture the functionality of targets or their similarity. Our annotation scheme captures all the essential properties of datasets, predictions, and drug targets.

The results of a preliminary work on an annotation scheme for the drug discovery have been published as a use case in this paper:

Panov, P., Soldatova, L.N., Dzeroski, S. (2014) Ontology of Core Data Mining Entities. J. of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. 28/5-6: 1222-1265.


2. Software development. We have developed and successfully tested the software infrastructure to run QSAR and meta-QSAR experiments.

3. Software integration. We have integrated the workflow of our project into the OpenML platform (http://openml.org/). OpenML is a popular platform where datasets and predictions made by various machine learning algorithms are stored, shared and compared. This open approach to the sharing of machine learning experiments is designed to save time and efforts, as there is no need to repeat computational experiments. We have made an agreement with the OpenML Team that this platform will have a dedicated to drug discovery section. In this way the drug discovery research community will benefit from this already established platform and its functionality (i.e. the comparison of different predictions across different datsets).

We have adjusted our software to enable the deposition of our datasets and the results of machine learning runs directly to OpenML. We have worked together with the developers of OpenML platform and they implemented a secure access to the store datasets. 

Dr Sadawi and Prof. King (the University of Manchester) participated in OpenML Workshop, University of Technology Eindhoven in October, 2014 
By the end of the project all data and machine learning predictions will be available at OpenML. 

4. QSAR learning. We have done initial trails of QSAR and meta-QSAR learning. We are currently running the main QSAR learning experiments.

5. Meta-QSAR learning. Our meta- QSAR approach has proven to be more successful than the typical approaches used in drug activity predictions. The meta- QSAR predictions have outperformed random forest, vector support machines, and other popular algorithms in the majority of cases. We extracted 2,750 targets from ChEMBL with a very diverse number of chemical compounds. For the meta-learning stage we conceived a classification problem that indicates which QSAR method should be used for a particular QSAR problem. The training and learning dataset is formed by meta-features extracted from the datasets of the base learning level and are based on target properties (hydrophobicity, molecular weight, aliphatic index, etc) and on information theory (mean, mutual information, entropy, etc). The hypothesis that there is no single way to learning QSARs has been confirmed. We have obtained sufficient experimental evidence that meta-QSAR learning is correctly suggesting 
for almost all targets which QSAR method should be used.

6. Additionally to the planned work we have worked on transfer learning. We developed a novel approach for a transfer learning using the evolutionary distance of targets to improve the standard QSAR learning through use of related targets.

The problem of how best to learn QSARs is of great industrial and medical importance. Drug development is arguably the most important applications of science in the UK. The average cost to bring a new drug to market is ~&amp;pound;500 million. A successful drug can earn &amp;pound;billions a year, and as patent protection is time-limited, even an extra week of protection can be of great financial significance. The UK (both academia and industry) is a leader in QSAR research and chemoinformatics in general as can be seen by its publication record.
