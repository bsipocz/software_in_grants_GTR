Our goals are both to understand the physics behind these phenomena and to exploit them, especially for cosmological purposes. We have a particular interest in time-domain astrophysics as an efficient tool for pursuing these goals. These research interests cover a huge range of scales, from accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, to quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). 

In this application, we request support for projects across the range of topics outlined above. On Galactic (i.e. stellar) scales, we will use simultaneous fast X-ray, UV and optical observations to shed new light on the variability of accreting X-ray binaries. We will also produce the most sensitive time-domain hard X-ray ``meta-survey'', by synthesizing data from three separate space missions for the first time.

On extra-galactic scales, we will self-consistently model the observational signatures of accretion disk winds in AGN and thus test outflow-based unification scenarios. We will also use multi-wavelength time-domain observations of AGN to understand the disk geometry and emission processes close to the supermassive black hole. Additionally, we will leverage a NuSTAR X-ray legacy survey we are leading to robustly measure the column-dependent space density of obscured AGN for the first time. Finally, we will exploit our leadership in an eMERLIN legacy radio survey and its associated Chandra Large X-ray Program to establish the X-ray and radio properties of AGN down to unprecedented low luminosity levels.

On cosmological scales, we will use multi-object spectroscopy to measure the host galaxy properties for the sample of SN Ia provided by the Dark Energy Survey, which will yield the most precise supernova-based cosmological constraints to date. We will also drive time-domain science and supernova cosmology within VEILS, the first (and UK-led) extragalactic infra-red synoptic survey. In addition, we will shed new light on the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, by identifying the interaction between feedback and mergers in creating the well-known relationship between black hole mass and velocity dispersion, and by establishing the relative importance of internal (e.g. disc instabilities) and external processes (e.g. mergers) for galaxy evolution.

Given our long-standing commitment to public engagement with research (PER), we will also develop and deliver high-impact PER activities. These will range from a citizen science project based on X-ray light curves to a high-quality full-dome video illustrating how time-resolved, simultaneous X-ray and optical observations allow us to ``see'' the immediate environment around accreting black holes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of the University of Southampton (UoS) Astronomy Group addresses some of the biggest questions in modern astrophysics, bringing benefits through public understanding and curiosity, providing cultural enrichment via collaborations between our scientists and the arts, and through links with industrial partners to provide economic prosperity. This new grant will consolidate and broaden the variety and scope of this impact.

Astronomy remains at the forefront of public engagement in science with a high profile and almost insatiable public interest. Our team (including scientists) participate in standard outreach activities (e.g., talks at science cafes, astronomical societies, blogs/social media) but also continuously look for opportunities to reach new audiences. Our group directly reaches thousands of students and members of the public each year through:

* 'Soton Astrodome' (~7000 school students/year + 1000 members of the public in events like Stargazing Live evenings, Southampton Science and Engineering Festival, Winchester Science Festival, Paulton's, Sea City Museum and City Art Gallery.

* The Supernova stand, which reached more than 10,000 members of the public across 7 events as part of the 'Bringing Research to Life' Roadshow at Cheltenham Science Festival, Bestival and Glastonbury (2014-2016).

* Our partner organisation, the Winchester Science Centre and Planetarium (WSC) hosts 175,000 visitors/year and is a beacon for public engagement, family learning and empowerment. The UoS and WSC have engaged in task-level cooperation based on mutual trust for more than 10 years (and recently more formally through a Memorandum of Understanding). WSC has contributed directly to student/staff enrichment through the provision of placements/volunteering opportunities as well as REF Impact Case Studies through the creation of multiple high impact, interactive exhibits and public engagement expertise.

* Teachers support: through school's partnership with the local Science Learning Centre and our Ogden Trust schools. We also have an Issac Physics fellow who runs workshops for A-level students and runs teacher CPD. This support has long-term value for the future teaching of the physics and astronomy.

* #AstroAirport: we took our team to the departure lounge at Southampton Airport and engaged over 4,500 passengers in a two-way conversation about our world leading research (2016).

* We have led the 'SETI Cipher Challenge', engaging with more than 280 students/year with challenges directly linked to our research (2014-present).

Besides PE, our group also participates in enterprise activities. For example:

* We have a distinguished body of work on the design of technology for gamma-ray detection and imaging with impact in the fields of homeland security and nuclear safety and counter-terrorism practices. A spin-out company, Symetrica, currently employs 26+ people in the UK and the US, and has been recognised as an example of best practice, (Symetrica recently closed a &amp;pound;143 million deal for its hand held radiation detectors). A knowledge transfer partnership between UoS (PI: Bird) and Symetrica started in Nov. 2016, funding research on new imaging systems for medical science and homeland security.

* Opticam is a UoS-led triple-band high-time resolution camera for Astronomy (partially supported by the STFC Impact Acceleration Account 2016). Our market research shows that it has commercial potential in the amateur community.

We also provide a significant source of trained, skilled PhD graduates for non-academic professions. Our astrophysics PhDs, with their analytical and data skills, remain sought after in industry (including medical physics, the defence industry, financial data projects and the education sector). To enhance this area, we have recently set-up a joint-PhD program with UoS department of Electronics and Computer Science to train PhD students in areas promoted by UK's Alan Turing Institute.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1097527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R000506/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>85</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6EE6184F-4A3C-4A99-A3AC-55FC62120A44</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Computational Methods &amp; Tools</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6D4F9380-A853-4602-9383-3E0067A53A84</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stellar Astronomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
