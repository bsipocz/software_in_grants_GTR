It is estimated that by the year 2040, 288 million people will be affected by AMD. As such, it represents one of the biggest economic burdens faced by healthcare services around the world. AMD is a complex condition, caused by a combination of non-modifiable (e.g. increasing age, ethnicity) and modifiable (e.g. obesity, smoking, dietary antioxidant intake) risk factors. Genetic variants also play a significant role in AMD risk, with rare and common polymorphisms in the Complement factor H (CFH) gene accountable for up to 50% increased risk of disease development. Animal and cellular models of AMD are not able to accurately replicate the biological complexities of the condition, thus precluding understanding of the contribution of genetic variants to disease pathogenesis. Consequently, there are very few treatment options available. Early-onset macular degeneration (EOMD) is an important cause of severe and progressive visual loss in young adults that shows very similar disease pathology to AMD. Unlike AMD, EOMD has a much weaker association with life-style related risk factors and is often present in more than one generation of a family suggesting a strong genetic component. Research has shown that rare, deleterious and common AMD-associated DNA changes in the CFH gene underlie EOMD in a proportion of cases. The aim of this project is to study the role of CFH impacting variants disease pathogenesis using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiated in to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from EOMD patients. This study will investigate the direct impact of genetic variation on protein function, before employing cutting-edge 'omics methodologies to measure the genome-wide effect of impaired protein function at multiple biological levels. Increased understanding of EOMD biology will shed light on the mechanisms driving AMD onset and progression, and will facilitate the development of treatment strategies. In addition, further insight into the the contribution of genetic variants to disease development will provide more patients and their families with specialised care, precise diagnosis, prognostic information and genetic counselling- crucial in the era of personalised genomic medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The use of monogenic sub-forms to unravel the complexities of common disease is a recognised strategy that has been used to further understanding of diabetes, cancer and autoimmune disease. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual loss in the Western world. AMD exemplifies common disorders but is atypical in its genetic contribution. However, a major limitation in AMD research is a lack of comprehension of the functional impact of genetic contributors to disease outcome thus restricting the clinical usefulness of genetic information. Further, animal and cellular models do not replicate the genetic and metabolic complexities of the condition, thus impeding understanding and limiting the development of treatments. Recent research has implicated rare and common AMD-associated risk alleles in the Complement Factor H (CFH) gene as the underlying cause of monogenic, early-onset macular degeneration (EOMD); a condition that is pathologically similar to AMD. This study aims to investigate the role of CFH impacting variants using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from genetically defined EOMD patients. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is considered to be the primary site of disease in EOMD/AMD, therefore this project aims to develop an iPSC-RPE model of EOMD. By employing a multi-level, holistic, systems biology approach, this work aims to measure the genome-wide impact of impaired Factor H (FH) function with the aim of identifying novel gene regulatory networks and disease pathways that will inform understanding of monogenic and complex forms of macular degeneration. Increased understanding of the contribution of genetic variants to EOMD/AMD pathology will facilitate the development of stratified medicine approaches to patient care. Further, identification of the molecular mechanisms underpinning macular degeneration will expedite the development of novel therapeutic modalities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288978</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R024952/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
