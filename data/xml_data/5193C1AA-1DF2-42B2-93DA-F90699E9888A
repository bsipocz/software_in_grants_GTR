Mastitis can linger, and often recurrent signs often follow acute infection. Rates of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are high in mastitis isolates from Brazil. The situation calls for better control, including hygiene practices that kill &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; pathogens, where protection is conferred by antimicrobial resistance and by the ability of common mastitis pathogens to &amp;quot;hide&amp;quot; from antimicrobials within biofilms and host cells. These challenges inspired us to test the potential use of a micro-biocidal polymer to kill antimicrobial resistant, biofilm and intracellular forms of S. aureus. Our preliminary (in vitro) results are promising and have prompted this research proposal, which aims to develop a novel anti-mastitis technology for practical applications on the Brazilian and global dairy farms. In this project, we will test the effectiveness of the approach as a teat disinfectant on teat samples obtained from abattoirs. We are hopeful that the results will help to guide us towards the development of an improved teat-dip control for mastitis, and in the longer term an improved therapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>CAREER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH TRAINING - WHO?: Students, young researchers and scientific staff will gain training. HOW? The project will train young researchers in both the UK and Brazil. These researchers will be trained in state of the art methods for AMR, drug development and biopharmaceuticals delivery. The work will involve both research and development including discussion with regulatory agencies. Therefore, the project leaders will gain broad exposure to a range of methods that are widely relevant to disease control in practice. Also, the experience is highly relevant to industry in both countries. Finally, researchers with an understanding of the challenges of mastitis control and modern strategies to tackle the problem are of value to the government and in forming new policy. The TIME FRAME for impact will be the span of the project lifetime, and job satisfaction, skills development an on-ward employment will be monitored to MEASURE impact.

WIDER EDUCATION THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT - WHO?: Farmers and the public will gain knowledge. HOW? Engagement with scientists: A key object of the project is to publish the work in high quality and accessible scientific journals, with raw data and full methods descriptions available. This will help to ensure maximum method and technology uptake. The TIME FRAME for impact will be the final months of the project, and presentations and publications will be used to MEASURE impact. Engagement with private sectors: In the UK, the RVC and SoP have extensive links with companies that develop therapies for animal and human health. In Brazil, MVdS interacts with most or all of the important animal health companies. The TIME FRAME for impact will be the final months of the project lifetime, and engagement with industry will be used to MEASURE impact. Engagement with dairy farmers: The RVC and USP maintain active cooperation with national dairy associations and individual farmers in Brazil. FThe TIME FRAME for impact will be the span of the project, and engagement with farmers will be used to MEASURE impact.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION - WHO?: Industry and farmers will be able to exploit the project results. HOW?: We have already taken steps to ensure that parts of the base technology are protected with patent applications, and we have made progress in out-licensing the technology. Indeed, the technology currently underpins two Phase I/II PoC trials in humans. This general pathway will be pursued further to ensure maximal exploitation of the project outcome. In addition to mastitis, we see several exploitation opportunities and we will pursue the most appropriate routes selectively. The TIME FRAME for impact will be the final months of the project lifetime, and investment from industry will be used to MEASURE impact.

FOOD SECURITY AND ANIMAL WELFARE IMPROVEMENTS - WHO? People and animals will enjoy improved lives in the developed and developed countries. HOW? Infection control will improve the production and safety of food systems and the quality of life of animals and staff involved in the dairy industries in developed and developing countries. The development interests of UK and Brazil are very well aligned in this project. In both countries health in the dairy industry is a major concern within food security and safety. The project aligns with the government's UK Strategy for Agricultural Technologies and DfID priorities. The project will increase the pace and scale of uptake of an agricultural innovation by farmers in an important developing country - Brazil. Small producers will benefit from a more reliable and efficient production, which will improve financing and ability to plan. The outcome will help control mastitis that has a large burden within the animal and human health and farm economics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R022569/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
