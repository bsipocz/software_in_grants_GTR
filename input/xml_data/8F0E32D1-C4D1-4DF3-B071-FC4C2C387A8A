Head and neck cancer is a devastating disease. Its incidence continues to increase in the UK. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment, but often requires reconstruction both to restore function and to minimise the psychological effects of surgery. 

Reconstruction is achieved through free tissue transfer (FTT), using tissues such as the radial artery forearm flap. However, FTT carries a significant failure rate. The major contributors to flap failure are ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and vascular thrombosis. IRI is an unavoidable part of free tissue transfer, which currently has no treatment.

Pretreatment or ?preconditioning? of tissues can reduce the severity of IRI. Preconditioning involves the induction of a protective response within tissues to enable them to better withstand an impending insult. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an enzyme which can be used to precondition solid organs to protect from IRI, an effect mediated through its reaction products carbon monoxide and biliverdin. Pharmacological induction of HO-1 prior to free tissue transfer has the potential to improve the success rates of free tissue transfer in patients undergoing reconstructive surgery.

Aims
This laboratory study will investigate the ability of heme oxygenase-1 based treatments to reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury in an animal model of free tissue transfer.

Methods
A rat model of free tissue transfer will be established using myocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Once optimised, the protective effect of systemic HO-1 induction on reducing IRI will be assessed on in situ flaps. HO-1 will be induced by heme arginate or curcumin, both of which readily induce HO-1. Ischaemia reperfusion injury will be assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry and biochemical assays including SOD, myeloperoxidase and caspase activity. Carbon monoxide is a product of HO-1 activity, responsible for many of its effects and the therapeutic effect of novel topical carmonoxide releasing dressings will be assessed in this model. Subsequent experiments using free tissue transfer will establish whether local or systemic induction of HO-1 is essential for its protective effects.

Clinical Implications
This study will investigate the use of pharmacological agents and a novel topical dressing to protect free tissue flaps. Each agent is suitable for subsequent use in patients. This study has the potential to form the basis for subsequent human studies investigating the application of preconditioning in free tissue transfer. If successful, this project will lead to the development of novel strategies to improve the outcomes of reconstructive surgery in patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208967</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I have developed a model of transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in a rat.
