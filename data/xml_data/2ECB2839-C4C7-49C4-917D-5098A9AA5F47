Gas Knowledge Exchange (Directed) Fellowhip</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M006859/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Fellow will work at the interface of academic research and industry, and be responsible for exploring, mapping and cross-linking relevant environmental data sets from both sectors. A key aspect of the Fellowship will be to chart the possibilities, scope and limitations of a wide portfolio of environmental data resources from industry, academic research and the wider environmental community. 
For the last three decades, EU environmental policies have focused on determining adverse and undesirable changes to the natural system as the result of human activities and on initiating management responses to alleviate impacts (Borja et al. 2009). In addition, resource management, environmental assessment and monitoring primarily focus on single industry sectors in many regions (Queffelec et al. 2009; Kenny et al. 2009). However, there has been a shift in the perception of environmental management in the political agenda, with a move towards an integrative and ecosystem-based management system (EBM), a requirement for quantitative cumulative impact assessment and mapping; and integrated monitoring measures. The environmental research undertaken during the Fellowship will focus on pertinent policy, industry and research questions that may include: (a) what monitoring requirements need to be met for decommissioning; (b) how can recovery be assessed; and (c) will ongoing monitoring be required? 
A strict legal framework of national, regional and international regulations governs how disused offshore facilities are decommissioned. Presently, and in the coming years and decades, a number of offshore O&amp;amp;G installations will be decommissioned, not only presenting a number of economic issues (Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK forecasts the total cost of decommissioning for existing and sanctioned infrastructure to be &amp;pound;28.7 billion from 2012 onwards); but also a number of significant environmental challenges. The combination of decommissioning issues, new deep-water exploration territories (platformsin deeper water may have probability higher risk of an incident, such as a spill); and the new production techniques, all highlight areas of uncertainty in environmental data management and assessment. Only a coherent environmental data platform will enable assessment and analysis to be conducted efficiently and in the most scientifically rigorous manner. 
Thus, one of the key activities of this Fellowship includes the development of a web-based mapping portal that incorporates current NERC, industry and other sources of environmental data. This portal will make a transformative difference in data accessibility. The Fellowship will also contribute towards a culture of change with regard to data collation and management. Through close industry liaison and KE, the Fellow will work towards securing industry buy-in to this concept of contributing data directly into the portal at source (e.g. uploaded directly as part of the reporting process). Therefore we anticipate that this KE project will also influence future environmental policy and legislation and facilitate addressing uncertainties surrounding the assessment of licensed activity impacts from exploration through to decommissioning on the environment.
Traditionally, marine monitoring around the UK has been limited in scope, in part due to lack of guidance on what, when and how things should be monitored. This is in contrast to, for example, the Norwegian O&amp;amp;G industry which has carried out systematic monitoring of the offshore environment since the ninties (CPA, 2011; OSPAR, 2007) Understanding how Norwegian authorities use their environmental data and lessons learned from the process will be important in determining how best to create the KE platform. Discussions are currently underway to establish Norwegian partnerships, building upon the HWU research team's existing collaborations with the Institute for Marine Research who lead the Norwegian shelf habitat mapping MAREANO programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Society for Underwater Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Society of Underwater Technology - Decommissioning working group</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2D14D9E-8B14-4B23-9CBE-8B759E5A1A90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MASTS/SUT Decommissioning Workshop - October 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd3cd4062ee7.52353277-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>To use the combined expertise from marine salvage, oil &amp;amp; gas decommissioning and marine science to influence, educate and unlock solutions to wreck removal and offshore energy challenges and opportunities.

This report through a stakeholder engagement plan identified the types of data collected by marine industries and the mechanisms by which industry data are made publicly available. I was engaged in this report as a stakeholder for the oil and gas industry, and contributed knowledge of the industry and environmental data. Following the final report publication, a workshop was held in London in February 2016, to further discuss the options to making industry environment more available. I helped with the organisation of the workshop, through dissemination of the event to my industry and academic network and facilitation on the day. The workshop outcomes will hopefully boost the access to industry data for use by researchers, industry and the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c33d80d59db5.37492939-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The specific role of PSEG is to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to produce periodic assessments to identify the nature and influences that human activities have on the socio-economic uses of the marine environment.

My main roles include putting together the lecture and workshop programme for the 30 students. This involves involving my network of industry and government professionals to provide the students with an overall picture of the oil and gas industry from licensing and permitting, seabed surveying and monitoring to decommissioning. The students gave good feedback regarding the lectures, and all reported that they learned significantly from the course. Areas for improvement for next year include trying to reduce areas of repetition between speakers. The industry and those involved also gave good feedback, as they enjoyed engaging with the students and all found that their lectures led to interesting discussions.

The students reported back to the CDT that they enjoyed the visit and found it a useful experience. The visit will be repeated with CDT students in April 2016, and an additional opportunity will be extended to students of MASTS institutions in 2016. We are now exploring the potential of submitting a joint application with the Centre to NERC for an advanced training course on ROV operations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c3360f2775a3.20882033</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award is a knowledge exchange fellowship, therefore impact is measured in terms of collaboration with others and engagement.

At present, the engagement and collaboration with industry, government and academia is getting stronger. I have been included in a number of industry events.

I have been involved in a number of workshops in the past year, and have created a good network of policy and industry colleagues. One main impact to be measured in the coming months, is the facilitation of a round-table discussion with Shell and a number of researchers. It is hoped that the workshop will lead to a research programme that will feed into the Shell Brent Decommissioning project. 

The industry is more acutely aware of NERC and the type of NERC research that is being undertaken.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0C1684DB-5B08-4337-A46D-ECDE25CD7C71</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc3db68b6f59.02637991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M006859/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>2ECB2839-C4C7-49C4-917D-5098A9AA5F47</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M006859/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>221586.28</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>EC0BCFE4-6684-4993-8C79-CD7DB265B9FF</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M006859/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>117492.16</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-04-29</gtr:start><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFAA021A-6F31-43D9-8517-EA79D1E71F54</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Conventional</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF1A1580-BC3D-4008-855B-67221E5AC026</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oceanic Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
