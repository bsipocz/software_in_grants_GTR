&lt;p>One-hundred 6-year-olds will participate in two studies testing whether exposure to oral narratives with a high ratio of subordinate clauses will lead to an increase in the use of these subordinates in their own retelling of similar narratives. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is divided into three phases:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>In phase 1 the children will be tested for their comprehension of words and of language structure through standardised tests. Their use of subordinates will also be tested through the elicitation of narratives. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>In phase 2 the children will be divided into two groups: the experimental group will be exposed to narratives containing a high proportion of subordinate clauses; the control group will listen to narratives with a high ratio of coordinate clauses.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>In the third and final phase the children will be tested again to evaluate whether the experimental group benefitted from the intensive exposure to subordinate clauses. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The hypothesis is that there should be a significant increase over time in the experimental group, but not in the control group. &lt;/p>

Each child contributed three different stories to the corpus at three different time points. The first story was recorded during the pre-test, before a two-week language training phase. The second and third story were collected after the intervention phase, one week and ten weeks later respectively. The narratives were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed using the CHAT format specified in the CHILDES manual (MacWhinney, 2000). The corpus has been donated to CHILDES (childes.psy.cmu.edu), the child language component of the TalkBank system (http://talkbank.org/).
