&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How do social workers communicate with children in a range of practice contexts and how do the social workers and children experience these encounters?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The qualitative research will take place in two practice settings to encompass a range of key social work tasks with children: firstly, frontline referral and assessment teams, where relationships with children may have to be developed rapidly, and secondly, looked after children's teams, where there is the potential for longer term relationships.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In phase 1, the team will accompany social workers in their daily work and observe at least 80 meetings between social workers and children in home visits in the four UK nations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In phase 2, the team will video meetings with looked after children and use the videos to engage children and practitioners in reflections about how to improve communication.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Findings from the project will be used to develop training tools for practitioners. The research will generate important new knowledge that will enhance the quality of social work education, practice and policy and in so doing improve children?s experiences of practice and practice outcomes. The project team are guided by a group of care experienced young adults.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study will address two of the three economic and societal impacts identified by Research Councils UK. These are:

1) Increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy: The project will make a contribution to knowledge and skills in relation to social work with children and young people as well as to knowledge about obstacles and opportunities in terms of communicating with vulnerable children more broadly. 
2) Enhancing quality of life, health and creative output: The project will have a direct impact on those who take part in it (social workers and children), and will be of benefit to many more through the project's knowledge exchange activities. It is likely to be welcomed throughout the UK and beyond, as those working with vulnerable children struggle to find attuned ways of communicating with them. Similarly, the innovative method and tools will be readily transferable to other research and practice projects centred on work with children.

Who will benefit from this research?

Impacts are anticipated for different groupings of non-academic and academic beneficiaries:
- Children and young people and practitioners who take part in the research project
- Children and young people who receive interventions and services
- Those working in multi-disciplinary settings with children, e.g. social workers, teachers, school counsellors, early year providers, children and youth workers, child health professionals
- Those concerned with child welfare and child and family social work at a policy and management level, e.g. local and national policy makers and managers of children's services in both statutory and voluntary agencies.
- Social work academics and academics from other social science and professional disciplines.

How will they benefit from the research?

The study will have a differential impact according to levels of participation in the project:
 - Those who are involved as members of the advisory group in developing the research study's design,tools and dissemination strategy will experience an immediate impact (practitioners, policy makers, care experienced young people) in terms of learning about research and its application to practice.
 - The study will have a medium level impact on those who take part in the research as participants (social workers and children and young people). This includes being provided with the opportunity to reflect on their experiences.
 - All those who take part in the knowledge exchange activities (seminars and events), who access the articles and summaries and who use the practitioner training materials will also experience some impact. This includes increased knowledge and skills.
 - There is a potential for long-term and secondary impacts on children and young people about whom there are welfare concerns. They should benefit from better facilitation of their ability to express their views and better understanding of their needs, wishes and experiences by practitioners. This should lead to more accurate assessments of risk and need and better targeted provision of services. 
 - The research team will benefit from enhanced research experience and skills and the broader academic community will benefit from substantive and methodological developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>414010</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Continuing Professional Development workshop: Sussex</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EC22B76-AADC-47E1-897D-ABD26A71851D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk led to engaged discussion with the issues
