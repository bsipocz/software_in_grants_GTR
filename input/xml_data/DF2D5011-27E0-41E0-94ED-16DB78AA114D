&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The empirical work of this project involves a qualitative exploration of the populations of scientists and quasi-scientists on either side of the boundary between mainstream science and ?outsiders?. Interviews will be conducted with both members of the scientific mainstream and with those attempting to take part in physics from outside the consensus. Gatekeepers to the mainstream - journal editors, specialist librarians, and those responsible for maintaining ?open access? resources - will be interviewed about the way in which they maintain the boundaries of physics. ?Heterodox? physicists, both within and outside academia, will be interviewed about their model of science as a collective and/or individual activity and their experiences of working outside the consensus. This fieldwork will take place in the UK, with one visit to the US and one visit to Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PI's recent work on expertise in policy-making has stressed the necessity for policy-makers to consider scientific consensus/controversy when it exists and when it bears on policy-making decisions. The caveat is that before these are taken into account, the policy-makers must first be able to identify whether the consensus exists or not. The proposed project looks to answer this fundamental point by analysing a case study of a 'hard' science and the social mechanisms whereby it constitutes its borders and forms consensus view inside itself. This will be done by thoroughly illustrating:

1) How the boundaries of a science are established, that is, how scientific communities define what is 'in' and 'out' of their professionally sanctioned boundaries and defining legitimacy on technical issues.

2) How membership to an established community is gained by individuals.

3) How scientific communities assign different levels of expert-status to its members.

4) How scientific communities identify individuals lying outside the boundaries of consensus, and the social underpinnings of these standards.

These four points are directly tied to the important question of how policy-makers can identify when there is or is not scientific consensus in a given expert community and how one can identify what counts as consensus when it exists. The question can have major impact on public issues relevant to anything from local, national and international political agendas where technological and scientific issues arise. Stemming from the PI's research agenda are several case studies (e.g. the AZT controversy in South Africa) that highlight how misunderstanding or misrepresenting scientific consensus can lead to badly justified and badly implemented policy choices. The project will help us understand such issues.

In terms of a wider public understanding of science, the point of illustrating the social dimensions of scientific consensus is also tied to the PI's long established programme of increasing public awareness of the collective nature of scientific knowledge channeled through various media: the Golem book series on science and society, the Cardiff group's webpage showcasing the group's work, a Facebook site for the group's ongoing experimental project, public conferences and keynote adresses to groups outside academia across a wide range of disciplines, papers in policy-related journals and publishing in journalistic outlets interested in the group's work. Through these outlets the group highlights the collective dimension of science not as a weakness but as a strength. The case study would increase the pool of sociological studies that can be used to illustrate the point that science's value as a cultural product lies in its participants being immersed inside a collective enterprise.

arXiv administrators themselves comprise an additional 'external' user's of the project's results; as a group within academia but outside the immediate world of social studies of science. arXiv founder Paul Ginsparg is keenly interested in how the project's results could be used by arXiv to model its own borders and has provided a written offer to aid in carrying out the arXiv stage of the research, with interest in its implications for arXiv itself. Finally, as an open acces website for the diffusion of scientific knowledge, arXiv's participation model could have bearing on future discussions of how OA can be successfully implemented in the diffusion of knowledge in other instances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221747</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our promise was to explore fringe science with scientific and technological decision-making in mind. The revolution in our understanding of the natural sciences that began in the 1970s has shown how hard it is to resolve scientific controversy. Even in pure sciences such as physics, controversies can take half-a-century to reach closure. But policy-making has to work faster than this. Therefore we looked for ways of demarcating fringe science from mainstream science that, even if they were not epistemologically foundational, would enable policy-makers to justify to publics the choice to take mainstream science as the starting point for policy making. After extensive fieldwork covering the heartlands to the hinterlands of science we constructed a classification of fringe sciences and a table of characteristics comparing the fringe with the mainstream. We found, for example, that some fringe sciences did not intend their findings to contribute to science but to popular book sales; we found that some were determined to revolutionise science rather than add to it in an incremental way and, above all, we found that fringe sciences often exhibit what we call 'pathological individualism'. That is they distrust established paradigms and consider that the only valuable science must turn on individual inventiveness - in other words, they balance they aim to achieve in terms of what Kuhn called 'essential tension' is far more in favour of individual rather than collective achievement. These and the other criteria can justify policy decisions that are founded in the mainstream. 
Those findings are collected in the paper 'Collins, Harry, Bartlett, Andrew and Reyes-Galindo, Luis, 2016, 'The Ecology of Fringe Science and its Bearing on Policy', (http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05786). A second paper co-authored with Paul Ginsparg the founder of arXiv, the very widely used pre-print server, shows that arXiv's automated system for winnowing out fringe papers will not work for a class of papers which is 'past its sell-by date' - that is, has all the appearance of a scientific paper but has no credibility within the mainstream and thus policy-makers are bound to need to take the advice of mainstream scientists when deciding which findings are to be taken seriously in policy-making terms.

The findings of both of these papers are being used on our other publications such as the forthcoming book, Why Democracies Need Science (Polity, 2017) which indicates how policy-makers can assess the substance and standing of scientific consensuses</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work is being incorporated into a book which will explain how these sociological differences should be incorporated into technological decision-making exactly as intended in the research and is already being used in our other books 'Why Democracies Need Science' and 'Gravity's Kiss: The Detection of Gravitational Wavel'</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EF7CFF5B-D0FE-4835-90CB-16450BE30436</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ded36a2fe377.34595441</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05786</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1BB98C14-DA6B-4E64-B9B9-E9692838F907</gtr:id><gtr:title>Demarcating Fringe Science for Policy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Perspectives on Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/08e2d2c76b5d0e0c38efbb8e5ec15c10"><gtr:id>08e2d2c76b5d0e0c38efbb8e5ec15c10</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Collins H M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5899e3b974af96.42996569</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K006401/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
