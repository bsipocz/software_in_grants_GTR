In England &amp;amp; Wales approximately 1.4 million patients each year attend hospital Accident &amp;amp; Emergency departments with a head injury, and 200,000 are admitted as in-patients each year. There are no clinically-proven drug treatments that prevent brain cell loss after Head Injury. Clinical practice in Head Injury patients is largely supportive, centred on non-specific endpoints and management of physiological parameters (cerebral perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure(ICP) and tissue oxygenation). Head Injury is characterised by a &amp;quot;primary injury&amp;quot; from the mechanical insult, followed by &amp;quot;secondary injury&amp;quot; developing minutes, hours and days later. The majority of the neurological and cognitive deficits suffered by TBI patients result from potentially preventable secondary injury. There is an urgent need to develop drugs or combinations of treatments to prevent secondary injury after TBI and improve outcomes.
 
Xenon is a gas that is currently used medically as a general anaesthetic. Our laboratory has been investigating the potential of xenon as a treatment that can prevent or limit the amount of brain damage that occurs after a Head Injury. We have recently shown that xenon, if given within 3 hours of injury, can limit the secondary brain injury and improve outcome in a rodent model of Head Injury. Cooling of the brain or the body is used for some types of brain injury (babies suffering from hypoxia) and in cardiac arrest patients. In this project we will determine whether cooling combined with xenon is more effective than xenon alone and whether cooling reduces the duration of treatment required or increases the time window within which xenon treatment is effective.
 
The overall aim of this work is to develop xenon and cooling as a treatment for Head Injury patients. Xenon and cooling treatment could be given at the scene of injury, in the ambulance and later in the intensive care unit. Before the treatment could be used in patients it is first necessary to show a proof-of-concept that it works in an animal model of Head Injury. This project aims to obtain high quality pre-clinical data on the efficacy, the optimum xenon dose, temperature and the timing of the xenon and cooling treatment. This data will be essential in developing treatment strategies in future clinical trials of xenon and cooling in Head Injury.
 
If xenon and cooling are effective it could be a simple treatment that could easily be given to Head Injury patients to improve their outcome and minimise long-term disability. These findings could bring benefit to Head Injury patients in terms of improved treatments and quality of life and could benefit the National Health Service in terms of reductions in the costs of treating long term disability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Need: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects young &amp;amp; elderly populations throughout the world and results in a significant global healthcare burden. TBI patients often suffer from costly long-term neurological and cognitive problems, affecting family life &amp;amp; ability to work. Current clinical practice for TBI patients is largely supportive, centred on non-specific endpoints e.g. management of tissue oxygenation, cerebral perfusion pressure &amp;amp; intracranial pressure(ICP). There are no drug treatments aimed specifically at preventing neuronal loss and secondary injury following TBI.

Proposed Solution: Treatment with the noble gas xenon combined with cooling will be an effective treatment to improve outcome after TBI.

Rationale: We have recently shown for the first time in an animal model of TBI that treatment with xenon alone reduces secondary injury &amp;amp; improves short- and long-term outcome &amp;amp; survival. Xenon is a novel NMDA receptor antagonist and general anaesthetic, and is currently undergoing clinical trials as a treatment for ischemic brain injury (neonatal asphyxia &amp;amp; brain damage after cardiac arrest). Cooling is routine for ischemic brain injury in neonates, &amp;amp; used in adults with brain injury after cardiac arrest. Technology for delivery of xenon (eg AirLiquide Felix anaesthetic machine) and cooling (intravascular cooling devices, cooled blankets) is already available and approved for medical use. 

Development plan: Xenon combined with cooling may be particularly effective. Before this can be used in TBI patients it is crucial that there is preclinical data on the safety and efficacy of the combination of xenon and cooling in an animal model of TBI. This project will produce a preclinical data package on safety and efficacy, including the optimum xenon concentrations, cooling temperatures and timing of treatment. This preclinical validation data, including any new IP generated, will support a route to commercialisation &amp;amp; use of xenon &amp;amp; cooling in TBI patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research:

Researchers in Traumatic Brain Injury
Researchers in Stroke
Researchers in organ damage (eg heart) 
Clinicians treating TBI patients 
TBI patients 
Neurosurgeons
Neurosurgical patients
Families and friends of above patients
NHS 
Society as a whole
Industry/Pharma

How will they benefit from this research:

Researchers in the field of TBI will benefit from understanding of mechanisms of secondary injury development as described in academic beneficiaries above.

Researchers in stroke. Results obtained would also be relevant to research on ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke for the reasons above.

Researchers in organ damage (eg heart). Cooling and treatment strategies developed could also be relevant to protection of other organs (eg the heart following cardiac arrest). 

Clinicians treating TBI patients will benefit from a better understanding of the mechanisms of secondary injury development (secondary results in most of the morbidity &amp;amp; disability experienced by patients).

TBI patients will benefit from a potential new treatment strategy 

Neurosurgeons could benefit as the treatments may also protect from damage to healthy brain tissue occurring during neurosurgical procedures

Neurosurgical patients could benefit in terms of improved or safer procedures.

NHS will benefit in terms of a new treatment (xenon and cooling) that could result in significant costs savings if morbidity and disability is reduced. 

Family &amp;amp; friends of TBI patients will benefit in terms of reduced burden on family &amp;amp; carers that will enhance the quality of life of patients and their families

Society as a whole will benefit in terms of reduced long-term care costs, less under-employment or unemployment of TBI patients 

UK Pharma sector will benefit as staff employed on grant (technician &amp;amp; postdoc) will develop skills (eg in vivo pharmacology) relevant to this business sector

Other UK business sectors will benefit as staff employed on grant will participate in Public Engagement events as described in Communication Section &amp;amp; Pathways to Impact

Skills developed at PE events are widely transferrable into other sectors eg science communication/medical writing. Previous lab members are employed in fields such as academia, medical writing &amp;amp; intellectual property law.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>526991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7B3D428-EB9C-4F7F-AB59-7E5F228D415C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Xenon Protects against Blast-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury in an In Vitro Model.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurotrauma</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4a7a5614ed04ebd68afbd6d48c2a46d1"><gtr:id>4a7a5614ed04ebd68afbd6d48c2a46d1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Campos-Pires R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0897-7151</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6f05cdabcf87.39647985</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N027736/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
