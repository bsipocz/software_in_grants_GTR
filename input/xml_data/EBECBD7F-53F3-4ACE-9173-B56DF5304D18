lifestyle, and eating small amounts more often, may be contributing to recent increases in obesity, along with skipping breakfast, and eating later in the evening and at night. We shall use the dietary records of individuals studied for long periods of time, and whose weight, blood pressure and other risk factors for disease have been measured to assess whether how and when food is eaten, and whether or not changing the pattern of eating relates to obesity and other health measures, so that appropriate healthy eating messages are given to the public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Nutrients, foods and dietary patterns are regularly investigated in relation to disease, but much less is known about eating behaviours like meal frequency, meal skipping, night eating, regularity of dietary intake, and distribution of energy, nutrients and foods through the day. The proposed study will investigate eating behaviours in two longitudinal cohorts: and the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), both with dietary data at several timepoints. Diet diaries for several days enable proposed behaviours to be assessed. Tracking of behaviours will be determined using conditional agreement analysis. Eating behaviours and their maintenance will be studied in relation to diet quality, and to body mass index and cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors, thus informing healthy eating advice.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>219642</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Human Nutrition Research Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Timing of protein intake and physical capability in old age</gtr:description><gtr:id>8382D96A-1386-45F9-B139-8CD803965E16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none to date - actual project only began in 2010, although collaboration over prospective PhD student was earlier.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>HsPbubwb7jD-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This research project is on a different health area but has gained from the NPRI funded research through the development of the techniques to analyse dietary data by time of day. The Newcastle project is essentially the PhD project of a Newcastle PhD student, thus not bringing funds to HNR but the original scientific ideas were those suggested by HNR personnel, and hence there is collaboration over supervision of the study and the results that will appear. The original work for both the funded NPRI grant and the Newcastle work is based on NSHD ( 1946 birth cohort) data; Newcastle will extend this to the Newcastle 85+ study.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>HNR is contributing the methods for analysis of the dietary data and with the MRC Unit of Lifelong Health and Ageing, providing Newcastle University with dietary datafiles already modified to enable analysis by time of day.

The project is intended to explore how food is eaten and whether this influences diet quality and health outcomes, rather than simply examining food and nutrient intakes, the traditonal approach. HNR will carry out analyses using the 1946 British Birth cohort, and then the analysis wil be repeated using ALSPAC by the Bristol team and results wil be compared and contrasted.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>HNR is coordinating this project. It is carrying out the development work of defining the terms to be used and collating the literature around these. It is carrying out the initial analyses on the 1946 British Birth Cohort (National Survey of Health and Development) and then collaborating with Bristol to enable them to carry out the same work with the ALSPAC data. Both cohorts use a diet diary, which enables the times at which food is eaten to be subdivided and the distribution of energy and nutrients through the day to be related to body weight change and other health outcomes.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing</gtr:department><gtr:description>Time of eating and chronic disease outcomes</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DD82781-7213-4DF3-ADEA-6347C9A123CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development work has been done and the definitions chosen were presented at the International Dietary Assessment and Physical Activity Methods conference in Washignton in June 2009.
