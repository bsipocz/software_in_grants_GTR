Each area is detailed below.

Astronomy Unit

The research conducted under this grant covers the following areas of astronomy: Cosmology, Planetary Formation and Dynamics, Space and Solar Plasma Physics and Survey Astronomy. The research conducted in these areas has increased our understanding of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, during the so-called Inflationary era, and has increased our understanding of the dynamics of planetary systems (including the ring system around Saturn). Computer simulations have been used to study plasma processes in the Solar wind, including the development of turbulence, and surveys conducted with the VISTA telescope have been used to search for distant quasars.

Centre for Research in String Theory 

The results of our research are regularly used as stimulus for our
outreach activities and collaborations with artists. In particular,
the finds have been of interest to artists in how the study of nature challenges our view of reality.

Particle Physics Research Centre

There are two major research results:
- discovery of the Higgs boson
- first observation of the neutrino appearance channel
Apart from extending the general knowledge, there are a few specific outcomes: using the data analyses techniques in other areas like medical areas (big data), outreach and using lego to promote particle physics, development of high performance Grid, etc.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work on this studentship grant covers a number of research areas. 


Astronomy Unit 

The astronomical research conducted within the Astronomy Unit can be thought of as being fundamental physics, and so the primary audience for this research is the specialist astronomical community. The research does have broader interest for the general public, however, and the Astronomy Unit has used this research as part of its public engagement activities.

Centre for Research in String Theory 

The Centre of Research in String Theory conducts fundamental research in many important areas of modern theoretical physics and the main users of the outputs are experts in the immediate areas of research. Other potential beneficiaries include particle physicists and phenomenologists, and mathematicians in areas such as representation theory, algebraic geometry and number theory. Finally, the results of our research are regularly used as stimulus for our outreach activities and collaborations with artists.

Particle Physics Research Centre

The discovery of the Higgs Boson captured the imagination of millions of people. It will lead to an increased interest in science among the general public and lead to more students studying science at University.

There is a clear academic output from all the research generated that will affect the next generation of particle physics experiments. Moreover, our big data analysis can be used in many fields eg medical science. The usage of high power machines helps the development of more high power machines. The outreach based on our research can help student recruitment and generally increase the number of students studying physics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B8D711C5-1A28-4026-A49A-BEDABFFF0295</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647135ea9e11.36218613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/I506761/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
