Our community of 2,500 registered postgraduate research students form a vital part of our vibrant research culture and enjoy the benefits of our outstanding resources including state-of-the-art laboratories, high performance computer facilities and one of the UK's major academic libraries. The University has made a strategic commitment to strengthening its postgraduate research community and is investing more &amp;pound;15M in postgraduate research studentships between 2014 and 2020.
The University uses its DTP allocation to fund research studentships in its research strengths across the faculties of Engineering and Mathematics and Physical Sciences. Funding is allocated between research areas based upon the University's strategic priorities and level of EPSRC funding. The University also offers a number of industrially co-sponsored studentships through CASE conversion. These are allocated through an internal competition in January of each year. 
Details of research areas are given on the relevant Graduate School webpages. The lists of PhD topics for which DTP (and institutional funding) are available will be announced on Graduate School and University webpages in November. Research student vacancies will also advertised on nationwide web platforms (e.g. FindAPhD.com).
Further details on the opportunities within the Faculty of Engineering Graduate School covering: Computing, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical and Process Engineering, are available at the link below.

The corresponding link for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences Graduate School covering: Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy is http://www.maps.leeds.ac.uk/postgraduate-research.html
The timetable for appications and decisions varies between Schools and will be stated clearly in the advertisement. However, in most cases these will coincide with the University's other postgraduate scholarships that have application deadlines in mid-January, March or June.
Details on how to apply for a place of study and links to the online application form are given at 
http://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/125187/applying_for_research_degrees.
Each School provides a programme of subject specific training and enrichment, including seminar series, workshops and graduate courses. In addition the Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences Researcher Training and Development Hub (EME) http://www.emeskillstraining.leeds.ac.uk/ provides a comprehensive rolling programme of skills training courses, conferences and workshops articulated to the National Researcher Development Framework.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4163132</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509681/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
