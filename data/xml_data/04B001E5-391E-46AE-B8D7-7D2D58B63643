While European aquaculture has been struggling to maintain competitiveness, at a UK level research investment has dropped considerably, until the recent joint BBSRC-NERC initiative. Prior funding has largely focused on salmonids and shellfish, mainly spanning the areas of disease or environmental impact, often focusing on Scotland but not fully covering the breadth of strategic needs of the sector. Furthermore, there is often a decoupling between basic research funded by research councils and industrially applied research. Moreover, the impact of basic research has been further limited by inadequate mechanisms for knowledge exchange between academia and industry. This KEF will build the know-how for effective information exchange and research translation by connecting the actors within the aquaculture value chain. The fellow will work closely with research and industry, to identify knowledge needs, promote collaborations, disseminate BBRSC-NERC funded research and improve public perception of aquaculture.
A key deliverable and enabling tool will be an innovative and intuitive web-based, user-friendly visual database that maps the UK aquaculture sector, thereby connecting stakeholders and their areas of activity and interest. Further, the Fellow will create and publish 'Research Profiles', on department/institute specific research track records, and 'Company Profiles', on company's key activities and research interests. Another key activity will be the development of an 'International research network map', based on academia's connections with international partners so contacts are easily identified. These tools will provide the industry with information on potential partners, which can answer its R&amp;amp;D needs and will also foster the development of networks to access to EU funding schemes and international expertise.
The Fellow will advance the development of the UK aquaculture network, by meeting and developing contacts with industry, trade/advisory bodies and academia, and will bring stakeholders together through innovative ways in a sector-wide conference 'Connecting UK Aquaculture'. The fellow will organise an industry-focused workshop 'UK Aquaculture: key knowledge needs and gaps' and develop a strategy document on aquaculture research and investment priorities from a stakeholder's perspective, to inform and engage funders and policymakers.
This KEF will support the dissemination of BBSRC-NERC research through 'Research Bulletins' to industry and the creation and public dissemination of a series of videos explaining BBSRC-NERC research '@UKAquacultureResearchExplained'. The third pillar of the fellowship is assessing the public attitudes and perception of aquaculture and the development of recommendations to enhance public appreciation, which will be disseminated to funders, policymakers and industry. UK aquaculture best practices and success stories will be promoted through press releases, media engagement, social media, and an interactive web-presence. A series of digital materials for education and outreach in aquaculture will be created and widely disseminated to schools throughout the UK. 
By these combined approaches, the Fellow will promote collaboration opportunities between industry and academia, while facilitating informed governance and research funding, supporting the uptake of research by businesses and improving public perception of aquaculture. The impact of the activities started during this programme will extend post-fellowship, supporting the sector's competitiveness and internationalisation through an increased focus on innovation and industry-relevant research, enhanced synergy between industry and academia, and towards the sustainable development of UK aquaculture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department For Environment, Food And Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Marine Management Organisation (MMO)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Identifying evidence needs for modelling and valuing aquaculture potential in marine plan areas</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEBF274C-BCAE-44A5-B5BD-B2B12C7C03AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has resulted in the submission of a successful application to Valuing Nature Placements (30 Jan 2017; &amp;pound;20k), awarded by the NERC Valuing Nature Network for a 4 months placement at the MMO, to take place from April to July 2017.

I have met the collaborators from the Open Lab twice since September 2016 to discuss award management, timelines and database requirements. I have worked extensively on the acquisition of data for the database and liaised with stakeholders to discuss priorities for database use, on a three-phase approach. 
Baseline collection of data on academic stakeholders (Phase I; from 25 Oct 2016 - 20 Dec 2016) was done from BBSRC-NERC contact lists from previous workshops and activities, delegate list AE 2016, SARF database, previous KE Fellow, databases provided by companies, etc. This process involved contacting stakeholders to verify data, complex-data cross-checking and merging, as well as lengthy online data collection process. The second phase of the database development involved the collection company data, using the Duedil company directory (Phase II; from 9 January 2017 - 10 Mar 2017), which houses UK company records (access granted by Business Support Team, Newcastle University). This was a lengthy process, as it involved the selection of data available on the database, complemented by free-search of company information. The next phase of the database development is the most challenging and involves mapping links between researchers and companies, which requires data collection by one-on-one contact with academics and companies (Phase III; from April 2017).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Stirling</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Social Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>ARCH-UK Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFF550B9-9F5A-4A4C-B2E4-890374BAACE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The only output to date is the successful bid, as the 4-year award is yet to start.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f9a0ed4776.49959303-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Striling Uni and Swansea Uni are currently the network's PIs and have led and coordinated the bid, which includes academics of a series of UK institutions.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Contribution to the application to the BBSRC-NERC Aquaculture Networks call by the ARCH-UK consortium and post-award discussion/revisions.

Further skype meetings are planned with academics that were unavailable to meet that day and a second visit to talk to the full group is planned for later this year. Researchers were concerned with the importance of creating and sustaining international links in the awake of BREXIT as well as improving international visibility. Some researchers highlighted the mis-match between funding available and their research interests, as well as the lack of University support in terms of facilitating collaboration with companies and protecting IP. SAIC was keen to collaborate with the fellow and facilitate links with the Scottish aquaculture sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c818c7161cc8.63439799</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation on the networking workshop &quot;Sustainable agriculture and food security&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6D7BBDE-B902-49C2-9BC4-02A5A2D9CE00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation on the networking workshop &amp;quot;Sustainable agriculture and food security&amp;quot; (organised by the Institute for Sustainability, Newcastle University, 2 Sept 2016) to identify collaboration opportunities with other researchers working on food security within Newcastle University.

The LinkedIn group &amp;quot;UK Aquaculture industry&amp;quot; was created on 6 March 2017 to connect stakeholders within the UK aquaculture industry and facilitate knowledge sharing and innovation, while providing a platform for new contacts and collaborations. Invitations have been initially sent to over 70 professionals within 30 UK companies related to aquaculture (from producers to retailers, consultants, trade bodies, etc.), but the more will be sent within the next few months. The group counts to date with the representation of 17 companies (e.g. Scottish Sea Farm, Scottish Salmon Co., Benchmark, Grieg Seafood Shetland, Cargill Aqua Nutrition, SEAFISH, Ocean Quality, Merck, etc.), with some companies already starting online discussions. The group provides a direct link to a range of industry stakeholders and will serve as a pathway to identify UK aquaculture businesses R&amp;amp;I needs and priorities, to inform research, funders and policy. Group members are encouraged to use it to share insights and experience across the sector, discuss industry issues, disseminate research and innovation projects, find new partners and promote collaboration opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82db14fe942.92026953</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12011465</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20085</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC Valuing Nature Placements (Valuing Nature Programme)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4C241577-D169-4174-A25F-413D41390451</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f41ab97c74.91224569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8550</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC Fellows leadership skills training bursary</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F987B971-EC9D-4014-B5E6-EB8956A9A977</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f2a7ae99f0.54803675</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P005349/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
