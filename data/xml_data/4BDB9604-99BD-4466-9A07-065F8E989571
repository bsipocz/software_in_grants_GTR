Most scientists agree that humans speciated in Africa some 200-150 kya (thousand years ago). However, considerable debate surrounds the timing and nature of our ancestors' subsequent dispersal from the African continent, with genetic evidence suggesting a date of ~80-50 kya, and archaeological evidence from Arabia and India suggesting earlier estimates back to perhaps 100 kya. Recent research demonstrates that South Asia is a critical region for understanding the Homo sapiens dispersal, as it was one of the first areas outside Africa to be occupied, and saw dramatic early population expansion. The 'Southern Dispersal' hypothesis posits that the route of movement out of Africa was along southern coastlines through South Asia and then onwards to Australia, accounting for occupation in the latter pre-dating that of Europe. However, the colonisation of South Asia has seen relatively little research when compared to other regions.\n\nThis study examines the archaeological record of key sites in northern India. The research looks in detail at the way our ancestors manufactured the stone artefacts that they used to hunt, collect plant foods and manufacture other tools. By examining the process of tool manufacture we can draw links between human groups in different parts of the world and attempt to track the spread of humans even in the absence of skeletal evidence. Importantly, by comparing the tools made by our direct Homo sapiens ancestors to those of the archaic human species that they replaced in India, we can look at differences and similarities in their behaviour and adaptations to South Asian conditions. Many people are aware of debates over the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans in Europe, but few are aware that the same process occurred in other parts of the world, including South Asia. This study aims to gather data on stone technology that will allow us to better reconstruct the process of replacement in the Indian subcontinent, providing greater insight into the geographical variation involved in human dispersal than is currently available.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impacts of the proposed research are spread across a number of levels, including personal, institutional, intellectual and public interest. Consideration of the trajectory of human evolution and our place in the natural world has been of fundamental concern to most members of society throughout human history, and the rapid expansion of archaeological science and mass communication of archaeological findings in the last half century have only accelerated that interest. This situation is enhanced by research, such as the current proposal, that aims to begin filling significant gaps in our knowledge, producing a more satisfactory understanding of how we came to be the dominant species on the planet. At the broadest level, therefore, this project will improve quality of life for people in both South Asia and elsewhere by helping resolve otherwise intractable issues in the history of humanity. Recognition of this public interest brings media attention (recent Late Pleistocene excavations I have directed in India have been filmed by the BBC and National Geographic, for example), which brings global recognition that UK and Indian scientists are at the forefront of human dispersal research and promotes continued UK academic competitiveness. Media attention on the topic of human evolution also helps establish a more general recognition of evolution's central role in shaping our world, which is important for countering pseudo-scientific origins stories based on religious agenda. On the ground in India, one of the primary impacts is increased recognition of and respect for the importance of archaeological sites and materials, with attendant economic benefits derived from cultural tourism. The Indian academic institutions and museums included in the project will benefit from attention directed towards their excavated collections, and it is hoped that this attention will further assist in raising standards for collections management in India.\n\nOn an intellectual level, the results of this research and the framework for further investigation which it aims to develop will be of considerable impact for researchers in fields such as archaeology, palaeoanthropology, evolutionary ecology, palaeoclimate, cognitive science, population genetics and social anthropology, as we consider the biological and social implications of the replacement of a previous hominin species by our own in India. Focusing the attention of such a diverse group of scientists on one central question brings added benefit, through development of inter-disciplinary ties and cross-pollination of research techniques and theoretical approaches. This outcome dovetails with identified research priorities: in a recent opinion piece in the journal Nature (7 January 2010, p.28), President of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research Leslie Aiello identified an increased focus on Asia's place in the human evolutionary story as one of the most important research challenges for the next decade. For the proposed project, the central methods of reaching these academic audiences are refereed archaeological journal articles and presentation at international meetings.\n\nOn the level of personal development, the proposed study is a new extension of my current research into the effects of the Toba volcanic super-eruption 74,000 years ago on hominins in India. Applying the same technological approach to the question of the last pre-sapiens hominins in India and the humans who replaced them will permit further career development in this area, with flow-on impacts to students whom I am advising at Oxford University and in India. Successful completion of this project will also permit me to subsequently address topics critical to our understanding of human-environment interactions in India, contextualising the technological results within a framework derived from evolutionary and</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69443</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Jwalapuram 22: a pre-Youngest Toba Tephra Middle Palaeolithic Assemblage</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7584C3EA-922E-4539-AA08-46AAF25DF503</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented this paper at Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, Pune, Maharashtra, India on 28 November 2011.
