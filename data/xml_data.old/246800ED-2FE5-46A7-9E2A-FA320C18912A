Unfortunately, while efficient supply chain design works well when the environment is stable and predictable, it also creates vulnerabilities when the environment becomes volatile and uncertain. Arguably, the current business environment typifies the latter and threats to business continuity have never been higher. Indeed, trends indicate that over the past thirty years the number of natural disasters has increased by a factor of five at the same time as technological disasters rose by a factor of eleven [1]. This project seeks to examine how supply chain design effects vulnerability. The underlying principle is that good design could balance both efficiencies and flexibility to disruptions. For example, when lightening wiped out a Philips manufacturing facility that supplied radio frequency chips (RFCs) to both Nokia and Ericsson their reactions, and subsequent performance, were very different. Nokia quickly set about pressuring Philips for alternative sources of supply while simultaneously redesigning the component for other suppliers. Ericsson, on the other hand, was extremely slow to detect the problem and although the design of its supply chain was very efficient it was not sufficiently flexible to change the source of supply. The results are telling. Nokia went on to meet its production targets and increase market share from 27% to 30% while Ericsson posted a $1.7 billion loss and ultimately had to outsource handset production to another company [2]. Similarly, the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 created a significant threat to business continuity across the globe, but whereas Ford had to shut its plants for five days, Chrysler used alternative logistic routes to ensure that supply continued [3]. Both examples clearly demonstrate the potential of good design for reducing the impact of disruptions.This work seeks to inform and assist managerial practices by advancing understanding of how supply chain design characteristics affect vulnerability. In doing so, the output will be a rigorous and relevant framework supporting UK firms to identify and prioritise sources of supply chain vulnerability. The framework will be designed around actionable supply chain design variables, such as sourcing strategies and inventory levels, with the ultimate objective of reducing vulnerabilities while maintaining levels of efficiency. The research will draw research support from both manufacturing and service industries, and public and private sectors to ensure that the framework can be tailored to context specific characteristics.[1] Hoyois, P., Scheuren, J-M., Bleow, R., &amp;amp; Guha-Sapir, D.

Within days of both these catastrophes, organisations were suffering from unavailable goods and services creating production delays and factory shutdowns (BBC News, 15 March 2011). Of course it is difficult to accurately calculate the true costs of such disruptions but estimates have put figures at between $50 - 100 million per day of shutdown (Rice and Caniato, 2003).



Our research focuses on reducing the probability and impact of supply chain disruptions, both to large macro-economic phenomena but also to more micro-level supply chain events, such as strikes, delays, production problems, and so on. The project analysed over 2,200 global supply chain disruptions to better understand the causes, locations and consequences of supply chain disruptions. In doing so, it has constructed the first (to the best of our knowledge) longitudinal disruption database and gives academic researchers and practitioners real data on which to focus research activity and develop mitigation practices (Squire and Chu, 2010a; Squire, Brandon-Jones &amp;amp; Caldwell, 2011). The results from the database also feed directly into calculating the insurance premiums of the world's first supply chain risk insurance product.



The project also collected primary data to better understand the role of supply chain design in creating resilient supply chains. This led to the development of a framework to identify, categorise and prioritise sources of supply chain vulnerability (Squire and Chu, 2010b). The framework consists of a detailed methodology and associated software and was developed in conjunction with eight blue-chip companies across seven industries and subsequently validated and refined with two further organisations in both the public and private sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Follow on funding is allowing us to develop the risk monitoring tool with industry partners.
