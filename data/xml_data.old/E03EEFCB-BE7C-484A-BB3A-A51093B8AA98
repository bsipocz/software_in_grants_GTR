All of these types of reactions have been studied extensively over the past century. In particular, their study under isolated (gas-phase) conditions enables the atomic-level details of the chemical dynamics to be uncovered. More recently, with the advent of short pulsed lasers in the 1980's, all of these isolated reactions have been studied at the timescales of the atomic motion in complex molecules, with the notable exception of electron driven reactions. One of the most important electron driven chemical reactions is that of dissociative electron attachment in which an electron breaks apart a molecule leaving a neutral and negatively charged fragment. 

The current proposal outlines two experimental methods that will enable the direct measurement of dissociative electron attachment for the first time. The outcomes will provide a new platform to study a wide range of such reactions and a few atmospherically important reactions will be studied to demonstrate the applicability of the methods. The outcomes will provide valuable insight into the fundamental nature of these electron driven reactions. This fundamental insight is crucial because the computational modelling of dissociative dynamics is still beyond the current state-of-the-art except for the smallest molecular systems. From a broader perspective, understanding electron driven chemistry will ultimately enable control and rational design of such processes, which is technologically exploitable. For example, plasma-reactions are employed in molecular coating, etching, and semi-conductor technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal is a blue-skies proposal aimed at gaining fundamental insight into electron driven chemistry. Hence, in the first instance, the beneficiaries are academic and the key short to medium term impact will be on academia as described in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section. The facilitate the impact of the work on the academic community, the applicant will engage and participate actively with the EU networks and special interest groups where the work may have impact such as networks based around plasma science and technology, astrochemistry and physics, ultrafast dynamics, and electron driven chemistry. Engagement through conferences will also be important as a route for dissemination and these will be carefully selected to involve communities that may have broad interest in the results and a workshop will be organised by the applicant to bring together key potential beneficiaries in differing fields of expertise. 

Much longer term impacts that may also be envisaged. Building a fundamental understanding of dissociative electron attachment is likely to provide a basis for understanding in greater detail the many industrial and commercial processes that are reliant on dissociative electron attachment as a basic concept. To achieve meaningful impact in these areas requires an understanding of the problems and limitations that industrial and commercial processes experience and this will be enabled through active participation of COST actions with significant industrial participation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>372427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R023085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
