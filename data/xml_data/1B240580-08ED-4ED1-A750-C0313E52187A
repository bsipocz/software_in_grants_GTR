They are unified by the inability of the bone marrow to make an adequate number of mature blood cells and patients die prematurely from infection or bleeding. We hold a large unique international registry of bone marrow failure patients, with samples stored from 643 patients with dyskeratosis congenita and 766 patients with bone marrow failure. In approximately 30% of these dyskeratosis congenita patients the genetic basis is unknown and in bone marrow failure patients the primary pathology remains unknown in over 80% of cases. The main aim of the research is to determine the genetic basis and primary pathophysiology of dyskeratosis congenita and bone marrow failure. To facilitate this goal we will undertake genetic analysis (principally based on next generation sequencing) in families we have collected with two or more affected individuals with bone marrow failure, but which do not meet the criteria of known bone marrow failure syndromes. Characterization of the familial forms of bone marrow failure will lead to the identification of new genes and biological pathways that are likely to be important in the idiopathic forms of these disorders. Elucidation of the genetic basis will provide new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that are highly desirable since treatment remains unsatisfactory for many patients with bone marrow failure.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential beneficiaries of the research are:

i. Patients with bone marrow failure and their families 
This research can be expected to provide new diagnostic tests and in the long term potentially new therapies for patients with dyskeratosis congenita and bone marrow failure. Over the period of the grant it is anticipated that several new disease genes will be discovered, potentially 1-2 new disease genes/year. This will therefore be of considerable benefit to these patients as it will facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. It will also enable carrier testing for at risk relatives. This will include the identification of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers, as well as offering the possibility of excluding carrier status in prospective parents.

ii. Clinicians who treat patients with bone marrow failure 
Clinicians who look after patients with bone marrow failure will benefit from this research as further characterization of the genetic basis of these disorders will assist them in making prompt and accurate diagnosis thereby facilitating appropriate management. In the long term it could provide the basis for developing new treatments for this group of life threatening disorders. 

iii. The general public
Our group has liaised with the BBC and several other media outlets over the years regarding the importance of telomerase and telomeres in human health and disease. In the course of the proposed research we hope to make further programmes related to our new research discoveries. This would help the general public obtain further insights into the genetic basis of bone marrow failure. It will also help them understand how such advances are important in developing new tests and treatments for this group of life threatening disorders.

iv. School children
Our group is situated in the Blizard Institute which houses the Centre of the Cell specifically established to engage with school children for the explanation and promotion of the types of scientific research that are conducted within our institute. It is the first centre of its kind in the world to be based within a working medical school research laboratory and can host up to 40,000 visitors each year. This gives us an excellent opportunity to engage school children in science including the research developments from this project. We believe this will have long term impact as it may go some way to nurture future scientists and doctors in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1062430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F129977A-F57F-4414-BF1E-C682F1BABEE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Myelodysplasia and liver disease extend the spectrum of RTEL1 related telomeropathies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Haematologica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c42e8607d5db89f1270a6699ed4cb93f"><gtr:id>c42e8607d5db89f1270a6699ed4cb93f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cardoso SR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0390-6078</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a846ebc729046.82702782</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P018440/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
