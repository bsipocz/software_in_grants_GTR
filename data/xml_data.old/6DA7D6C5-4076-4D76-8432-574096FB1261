That is to say the data changes, perhaps very rapidly, over time. Where traditional ideas have found sophisticated methods for indexing and searching very large sets of static information, much of today's applications, from high frequency finance to the indexing of the world wide web, requires us to be able to cope with dynamic change.

Pattern matching algorithms are central to the modern digital world. From word processing and web search to computational genetics and high finance, the ability to find patterns efficiently and accurately is of fundamental importance to modern industry. However, we are now witnessing a fundamental change not only in the ways data are being processed but also in the sheer size of commonly held datasets. The public genome sequencing projects, for example, have produced hundreds of gigabytes of sequence and related meta data and web search tools must answer billions of queries a day, each within a fraction of a second. Telecommunication companies collect terabytes of data every day which is itself only a tiny proportion of the data that travels over their networks. The types of data that are being stored in massive volumes online are also increasing, from audio to still images, streaming video and entire library collections.

As examples of the challenge we face, in telecommunications not only is the total data size massive, it streams at such a rate that we can only afford to store a small sketch of the input at any time and yet must still answer sophisticated queries of the data as quickly as possible. In web search, as well as the arrival of new pages, any part the existing data may change without notice. In all cases, we must be able handle such changes quickly, efficiently and with minimum cost. This proposal will allow us to develop fast algorithms to perform pattern matching under these new conditions. We will consider a range of scenarios, even taking into account multiple simultaneous streams of data or situations where previously successfully processed data can be modified at any point and at any time.

The second and complementary topic for this project is that of showing time and space lower bounds for the problems we have discussed. Where ever faster and more efficient algorithms are developed by the algorithms community, our understanding of the limits of what can be achieved, even in principle, is currently at a much more basic level. Such lower bounds, were they available, would not only be important for the significant theoretical interest and insight they provide, but also for the practical purposes of preventing fruitless search for algorithms which cannot exist. Within computer science in general, lower bounds have historically proven hard to develop but in the context of streaming and dynamic computation new ideas can now be applied. These results will provide a framework within which future algorithmic research can be carried out, therefore saving many hours of potentially fruitless search for methods we have shown cannot exist.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Algorithmic research has revolutionised the way that we all live our lives in recent years. Google, a company founded by computer scientists and underpinned with perhaps the greatest concentration of university trained algorithms expertise in the world, is but the most prominent example. Our proposal, whose core aims are to advance our knowledge of what pattern matching algorithms can achieve in the presence of dynamically changing data, will potentially impact a number of groups within academia and industry. Also of great importance will be much needed UK based training and human capital that this project will help to provide. We now briefly describe the main groups outside of the direct field of academic study which will be impacted by our work.

Time sensitive data intensive applications are now central to the most successful international companies. AT&amp;amp;T are said to process several terabytes per day of streaming data in real-time and employ dozens of full time algorithms research staff. Intelligence and security agencies require streaming video, audio and telecommunications to be analysed within strict time frames. In high frequency trading, the ability to respond within a fraction of second to a new pattern detected in trading activity can be the difference between financial success and bankruptcy.
We expect the advances we will make in dynamic and streaming pattern matching in particular to be of direct interest to these industries and others. In web search, any part of a web page can be changed and indexing this dynamic data efficiently is a critical problem. Advances in dynamic indexing and pattern matching will provide great time and cost savings in this context or for any company which regularly searches massive sets of changing data.

With respect to lower bounds, the results we will provide, while not directly giving new methods, will potentially save many hours of work in fruitless search for fast methods which cannot exist. In a similar fashion to the way that no respectable software company will attempt to write code that proves their software terminates (due to the Halting Problem), our space and time lower bounds will set the framework within which software development can occur. These proven limits may therefore be of as much practical utility as the provision of a new fast algorithm. Our proposal will use new lower bound techniques from seemingly unrelated fields to show fundamental results for dynamic pattern matching. The formal connections which we will develop between pattern matching problems and those from computational geometry or matrix multiplication enable us to place the pattern matching field into a broader theoretical context which will greatly widen its user base. In recent work we have already shown that, by regarding online convolution and multiplication as being fundamentally data structure problems, we were able to give the first improvement in their lower bounds for over 30 years. This new observation immediately raises the prospect of our being able to provide new insights into a whole range of streaming and dynamic pattern matching problems. In a similar fashion, it may now be possible to, for example, apply algorithmic techniques from fast matrix multiplication or utilise lower bounds methods from the 3-SUM problem to give us insight into the fundamental difficulty of pattern matching problems. There is also the exciting prospect of applying techniques from pattern matching to classic problems in the newly related fields.

It is widely recognised that the UK has been relatively weak in the mainstream of algorithms research that dominates top level US universities and global industry. Further investment in UK based algorithms research and training is vitally important for the national economy. This proposal, through the training and dissemination mechanisms set out in the Pathways to Impact document, will take an important step in redressing this imbalance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289045</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>799F536A-6F76-482C-B414-967660CB0210</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complexity of Flood Filling Games</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory of Computing Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345"><gtr:id>4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clifford R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1432-4350</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd630a7ac304.68740598</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>795156F1-0697-461F-93FE-4ABA60C7B5B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345"><gtr:id>4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clifford R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-61197-251-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd695f96b3e3.24538675</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A94C0369-7415-4F7C-9720-3BFBBFAD4523</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mismatch sampling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Information and Computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345"><gtr:id>4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clifford R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0890-5401</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd630abde5c2.63052977</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52825233-A5DD-497D-B089-E7EDBA674C7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Space lower bounds for online pattern matching</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical Computer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345"><gtr:id>4d9e2cfdb7f97950d60449f515031345</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clifford R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0304-3975</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd630a2f38a0.06534174</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BBB30C60-8313-4975-BA31-2A2A0FBE24E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pattern Matching under Polynomial Transformation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SIAM Journal on Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/515e8a1a1c5ceb1891a3ed22c1b01f39"><gtr:id>515e8a1a1c5ceb1891a3ed22c1b01f39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Butman A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0097-5397</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd630a548024.87507084</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25BBF020-8A8E-42CF-9278-83299AE6E186</gtr:id><gtr:title>Element Distinctness, Frequency Moments, and Sliding Windows</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd4568d5f16c0aa79bdb53bdb6593414"><gtr:id>bd4568d5f16c0aa79bdb53bdb6593414</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beame P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd695f7424b7.35576894</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J011940/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
