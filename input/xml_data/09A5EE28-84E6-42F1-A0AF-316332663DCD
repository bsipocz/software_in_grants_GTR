Intuitively this is a very obvious question. And its practical importance is obvious. We need to know how to make good decisions in politics, in medicine, in business, in career choice, about whether to go to war or not, about the environment, about where to cut or increase spending, about whom to marry (if anyone) and how else to live our personal lives, and in all sorts of other ways too. So if there is a simple answer to the question 'What makes a good decision?', we need to hear it. And if there isn't a simple answer to the question-either because there are different simple answers for different areas, or because there is no simple answer-we need to hear that too. \n\nThe question is also one that ethicists might be expected to focus on. Ethics is a practical study, with wide-ranging applications in human action. 'If philosophical ethics can't tell us how to make good decisions,' someone might rhetorically inquire, 'what can it tell us?'\n\nSuch an inquirer might be surprised by the marginality in most academic ethics of the question 'What makes a good decision?'. Not that ethicists have nothing to say about it; but they don't usually focus on it. This seems a missed opportunity, and in the research proposed I aim to put this right. I propose to take 'What makes a good decision?' as my focal question. To do so is to look at ethics from an unusual angle, and I believe a revealing one, which can be of interest not only to professional philosophers but also to decision-makers in, e.g., medical, business, environmental, and political contexts. \n\nWhen we think about the question 'What makes a good decision?', we find ourselves facing two opposite alternatives. One is to take a systematic view of ethics: to think that good decision-making is so central to life that there simply has to be a formula for making good decisions, otherwise we will be completely lost in life. The other is to take an anti-systematic view of ethics: to think that there cannot possibly be a formula for making good decisions, because life is too complicated and circumstances are too various. So, it is a waste of time to try and find one. \n\nIn my book I shall explore both possibilities. My own approach is to take an anti-systematic view of ethics, which I shall develop on the basis of a historical survey running from Plato, via Aristotle, Jesus, Kant, and Mill, to the present day. \n\nThe upshot of my overall argument will be that we can't expect any simple formula to tell us how to make good decisions in any way which can hope to be quite generally applicable. In particular, we can't expect the kind of simple formulas that modern numerical systems like 'decision theory', or systematic moral theories like utilitarianism, Kantianism, and (some forms of) virtue ethics, try to offer us. The result is one foreseen very clearly in Plato's Republic. It is that, to answer the question 'What makes a good decision?' adequately, we need to go a surprisingly long way round-all the way round to a theory of internal transformation, in fact. Instead of looking for a simple all-purpose rule to govern our decision-making, we need to look to ourselves, and in particular to our own capacity for good judgement. For even if a simple all-purpose rule for making good decisions were available-and none is, nor ever looks likely to be-its application would still depend on good judgement about how and when and where to apply it. This good judgement cannot itself, on pain of regress, be taught by any rule. As stressed by Aristotle and Plato-and in a different way, by the ethics of the New Testament-it simply has to be internalised from the right sort of moral education, the right sort of reflection on and contemplative engagement with whatever is truly of value. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will, I hope, benefit and impact on both academic philosophers, and also those involved in a wide variety of policy-making and decision-making contexts. There is a pressing need for focused and careful reflection on the questions what good decisions are and how to make them. \n\nMy proposed monograph will be the cornerstone for a good deal of academic and public engagement, in which I will try to promote these questions, and raise some doubts about some too-familiar ways in which they are often dealt with, but (I suggest) not always adequately. I will suggest my own answers to 'What are good decisions?' and 'How do we make good decisions?'. I hope that, by engaging with the work I produce, others will be enabled, from its publication on, not only to answer these questions better, but also to make better decisions for themselves.\n\nIf one is a decision-maker in (say) a political, economic, administrative, business, or medical setting, there could hardly be anything more helpful than further guidance about how to make good decisions. I would hope that my research on this question would be disseminated widely enough to be used by all sorts of people in their reflection on this and related questions.\n\nAs explained in other sections, the present proposal and application are just one part of a larger research trajectory that I am engaged in, which will involve me (and has already involved me) in a number of forms of public engagement to promote reflection on good decision-making: for example, business day-schools where I have spoken on ethics to non-specialist audiences, the conference of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (May 2010), the international philosophy conference on 'Intuition, Theory, and Anti-Theory in Ethics' in Edinburgh in July 2010 (for which we have 43 registrations as of 23.6.10), and this autumn's interdiscipinary conference in London on 'Making Good Decisions'. This latter conference (for which I have already secured &amp;pound;K funding from City sponsors, and which may, if further money can be found, be just the first of a series of conferences on the same theme) will seek to explore the interdisciplinary ramifications of the question 'What makes a good decision?', for example in business, military, medical, and public-policy contexts. This conference will particularly sharpen and focus my efforts to apply my research in extra-philosophical contexts, and among practitioners in a wide variety of other settings besides academic philosophy. \n\nThis activity too is not part of the current application, but is dependent, for its academic 'backbone', on the research work that is the subject of the present application. Other activities again are planned, and will take place in due course, as spin-offs of the present research. \n\nI am very confident that the research itself is innovative and highly original, and that it should attract a good deal of interest, and influence a wide range of debates both in and beyond academic philosophy--especially if I can place it with OUP, as I hope to.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40883</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been used to contribute to philosophical and public debate about the issues they address.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EDAD36CE-5211-4952-8CF4-65F0111E3380</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e869d26ab26.20444882</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The power and applicability of an anti-systematic approach to ethics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am developing a programme of philosophical research that is already having considerable impact--my 2014 OUP book Knowing What To Do was, for instance, a key part of discussion at the 2015 &amp;quot;30 years of Bernard Williams' Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy&amp;quot; conference in Oxford, which I organised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1E1DBB95-53F1-431F-BCCB-E81236D291B3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e871f7e1889.90166731</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/people/tc2973</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B4775C6-862D-4859-A675-FD958E690798</gtr:id><gtr:title>Knowing What To Do: Platonism, Virtue, and Imagination in Ethics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2bff74674887485c47a3e030ca711c36"><gtr:id>2bff74674887485c47a3e030ca711c36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Timothy Chappell</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-968485-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544e83181aebe0.24130022</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I020993/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
