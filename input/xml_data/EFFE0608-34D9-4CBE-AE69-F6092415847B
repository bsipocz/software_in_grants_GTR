Hence a fundamental aim of this project is to encourage people to participate in this study, in both practical and theoretical ways. As a result of this participation, some of them will be inspired to pursue the subject further and possibly follow an astronomy related career.

Another aim is to provide a multi-purpose Community Astronomy centre in the North Manchester region, sited in Bury, where currently no other facilities exist.

The roof top observatory will be based at Holy Cross sixth form college Bury, Lancashire and will comprise a fully automated dome and telescope viewed and controlled form a pre-existing fully equipped laboratory below that can hold up to 30 people at a time.

The Astronomy centre will serve a large community in and around North Manchester and Lancashire. The project will promote Astronomy on a number of levels: Education, from Primary to post 16, teacher training via the IOP and the general public will be given full access via independent Astronomy groups.

The Astronomy centre bid is for the building of a fully remote dome and telescopes. The Astronomy room below, Computer suites and interactive whiteboard is not part of the bid.

For the centre to reach as many people as possible from families to student and amateur research projects, the evening operation will be undertaken by a local Astronomy group independent of the college, and also with support from the IOP and local teachers who are trained in its operation. The idea being that the more people who are trained to use it the more we can snowball this expertise and involve as many pupils, families and general public in the Science.
The centre is a resource for all.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Astronomy centre will be marketed as a key asset of Holy cross College and advertised as such. it also will be advertised to local teachers through our local Science teachers meetings and more generally by the Institute of Physics who will be invited to run training from the centre. Local Astronomy groups will be invited to use the facility and new groups will be based here. Local universities will also be invited to visit the centre and deliver talks on their research projects with a view to inspiring and informing the general public and the students at Holy Cross College.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P001351/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
