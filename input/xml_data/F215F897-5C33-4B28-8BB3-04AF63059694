The goal is to achieve a good fit between a model and data without including too many variables. The main objective of this project is to adapt methods from the topological theory of persistent homology in order to develop new variable selection techniques. The proposal combines model description from the point of view of computational algebra with statistical methods such as the Lasso technique and Bayesian model selection.

Partners from network modeling, climate modeling and from robust engineering and design will provide data which will be used in case studies to assess the performance of the new methods. Also, the project will scope the use of software for combining topological and statistical algorithms, which will enable researchers to combine the different approaches without having to do extensive programming. Methodological results from this project have the potential to be applied to the analysis of large data sets in areas where the detection of interactions between explanatory variables is crucial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is foundational work and we hope that software ideas combined with demonstrated case studies will be useful to the wider model community. An example of this is the application to engineering robust design and analysis. The methodological results have the potential to enhance the analysis and design of engineering products. For example, the robust design group in Rolls Royce is a keen partner in the project and have agreed to participate in kind. As partners they will benefit directly from case study conclusions and in the midterm they may include new results and methods into their standard set of robust design tools. 

Research results will be disseminated through a variety of means. During and after the project, results and conclusions will be disseminated to academic groups through Seminars given by Maruri and Airoldi during and after the project. Potential UK statistical groups for this are Glasgow, Manchester, Warwick. Authors will also disseminate in engineering conferences such as the meeting of the Association for Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization in the UK (ASMO-UK) and big scientific forum/conference. Results of software scoping will also be made available to the modeling community, which in the longer term are expected to evolve into a series of procedures available online.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21707</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster in the Algebraic Statistics 2015 conference (Genova)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12C62806-90C3-4497-8968-2BABA1DBB3F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a poster showing results from the grant work.
