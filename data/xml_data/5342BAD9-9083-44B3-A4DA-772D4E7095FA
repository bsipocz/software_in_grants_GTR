Machine learning, a subfield of computer science, is a valuable tool to understand consumer/user preferences, including those relevant to urban development and urban service provision. Indeed, it can help to create new urban value propositions by applying data-driven approaches to urban business modelling. Machine learning algorithms in the urban domain provide valuable insights to policymakers. While the existing methodology produces models that can explain some data well, it can be improved by incorporating mathematical modelling from Decision and Behavioural Science to better capture the behavioural component of urban wellbeing.
 
Research in behavioural science offers models of individual decision-making that generate accurate predictions, and yet these models are not usually applied to large datasets; they are used on small amounts of data obtained through decision-making experiments. Understanding how behavioural science models can enrich existing machine learning to improve the personalisation of urban services - and by doing so increase citizen satisfaction - is the focus of the proposed research programme.

Our programme will address urban wellbeing through: an innovative approach to data analytics, Behavioural Machine Learning (BML); the creation of new urban policies as a result of improved personalisation; and the interaction with data (including self-generated data by citizens as well as citizen data by businesses and policymakers) in day-to-day decision-making. The proposed research involves large datasets collected from field experiments as well as publicly available data, the former particularly focused on the complex and large datasets that capture individual citizen characteristics and wellbeing.

Our programme is innovative because it: (a) broadens and integrates research in behavioural science, data analytics, computer science, and human-data interaction (HDI); (b) examines decision design for complex data-driven urban decisions that involve datasets with low informativeness, very large datasets which are difficult to manage, and noisy data; and (c) focuses on how the data is used by citizens, businesses, and policymakers.

It will have a broad impact in several ways. Firstly, we will work directly with multiple stakeholders to generate solutions that have practical implications for creating new urban policies in practice with measurable benefits. Secondly, its research outputs will suggest improved participatory modes for analysis and presentation of different types of data in the digital economy more generally. Its third value is methodological, as we offer a model of close collaboration and integration for social and natural sciences research. As a result of this project, qualitative and quantitative researchers will better understand the limits and possibilities of the other's methodology, leading to better and more applicable interdisciplinary research. A final impact is on general education in science: blending social and natural science enriches and motivates students of all ages, as well as the members of the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond academia, beneficiaries will include: (1) citizens; (2) businesses; (3) the public sector; and (4) data analysts. 

(1) Citizens: The proposed research will suggest ways to improve the personalisation of city services and thus urban lifestyles, which, through the creation of new services and environments, will benefit citizens because they will receive more personalised urban services, improved experiences, better communication, and more convenient delivery options. All these improvements will positively impact citizens' wellbeing, allowing them to engage with their self-generated urban data in more optimal ways and make 'better' (more optimal) decisions, which would increase their quality of life.

(2) Businesses: This project will provide a practical tool in the form of a ready-to-use BML repository, which would propose ways of anticipating future citizens' needs/wants through BML and resulting improvements in personalisation and new business models for urban environments. Urban product and service providers will be able to use the repository to increase citizen satisfaction. This, in turn, will increase business profitability through optimising data analytics and personalisation and offering better value-for-money to citizens. Businesses which may particularly benefit from this research are in such sectors as architecture and development, landscape design, energy, etc.

(3) Policymakers: The research results will offer new ways in which policymakers can use data and citizens can engage with their self-generated urban data. This will produce useful policy recommendations as to how the interactions between citizens, urban services, and data could be regulated and supported by the public sector.

(4) Data analysts: Data analysts will benefit from the new analytical methodology developed within BML.

Our impact and outreach efforts will focus on the following:

(1) Citizens: Our project will engage citizens through experiments. All experimental participants will receive educational feedback after each study. As a result, consumers will be informed about how to engage with their self-generated data more effectively, make 'better' decisions to improve their wellbeing. This will be facilitated through blog posts on the project's website, http://behavioural-analytics.com. Outreach to the general public and wider society will be accomplished through working with the press offices at UoB and Turing as well as via the use of social media (particularly, the dedicated YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1RadUEnNYrbdZW5nTVFsUw). 

(2) Businesses: We will work with Project Partner, HATDeX, and with City-REDI (UoB) as well as with the Warwick Institute for the Science of Cities (WISC, University of Warwick), for existing capacity and connections in the private sector to design meaningful tests of BML. 

(3) Policymakers: As a lead researcher on several smart city projects, the PI will involve policymakers (particularly long-term partners Birmingham City Council and the West Midlands Combined Authority) in BML discussions through regular meetings. Online and printed publicity materials will be designed to attract attention to the issues related to the project. Papers produced by the team will suggest policy implications of our results.

(4) Data analysts will be able to use the BML-repository as a practical tool, as the research team will make all analytical innovations and codes for all BML methods available via the project website, http://behavioural-analytics.com. Data analysts will also be invited to share their own modelling approaches and codes via the repository to facilitate feedback between the research team and practitioners working in data analytics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>315636</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R007926/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
