This particular Project argues the need to steer a course between two sets of contemporary theoretical positions: a revived anti-economistic aestheticism on the one hand, and the postmodern ironic elision of culture and economy on the other.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Speculating in 1930 on what life would be like in 2030, the economist JM Keynes (Keynes, 1930 (1979)) looked forward to a society in which science and the progressive re-investment of the proceeds of economic growth in human welfare, would have relieved humanity of the &amp;quot;economic problem&amp;quot; (ibid, 197). With necessary work reduced to a minimum, humans would face a new challenge: &amp;quot;...how to use his [sic] freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure...to live wisely, agreeably and well&amp;quot; (ibid, 198). In the midst of the deepest economic recession since Keynes wrote this optimistic prophesy, such words can seem, by turns, naively bucolic, utopian, patrician and condescending. However, in his desire to see a society in which its citizens could devote their time and attention to &amp;quot;the arts of life&amp;quot; (ibid), Keynes posed in his own way a question about the meaning and purpose of culture which was intimately related to the economic and social condition of society. In this way he actually places the question 'what is cultural value' within the question: 'what does it mean to live an un-alienated human existence?' With 17 years to go to Keynes' deadline, the allegedly advanced economies are no nearer to realising that aspiration as social and economic inequality soar to unprecedented levels and the priority of human welfare falls to a historic low in modern times. If we want to argue that culture is bound up with some of the most important and deepest of human questions, then we have to ask the kind of big questions Keynes was prepared to face, including how and why, despite all the advances since 1930 - in science, education, technology, medicine, and so forth, we appear no nearer to living &amp;quot;wisely, agreeably and well?&amp;quot;

Keynes lived in a period when, at least in the English-speaking world, culture could be regarded as something other than 'economy', even if, its realisation was intimately bound to it. In our own period, culture and economy relate in ways that Keynes would not have been able to understand and would possibly have been alarmed by. Keynes' near-contemporary, the German philosopher Theodor Adorno, would no doubt have seen the contemporary relationship of culture to economy as simply evidence for his 'culture industry' thesis, first elaborated in the 1940s. If we don't want to concede culture and economy to Adorno's pessimimism, then we have to re-appropriate their relationship in ways that ask the big questions. For this, one of the things we need to do is re-read the historical scholarship through the demands of the present - and its possible futures.

This project doesn't specifically seek to have 'impact' in any 'ballistic' sense, but its arguments may be of interest to a variety of professional audiences in the cultural field, specific art-form communities of practice, and possibly, some policy-makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15982</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A new critical perspective on cultural value.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By reading them.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5F5B6BAF-5342-4184-A7BB-12362F0A7F06</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f680eac6dc4.92595537</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91869/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77596CB1-4D01-4081-B51F-5742600D53E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Value: A Perspective from Cultural Economy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AHRC Cultural Value Project</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/02cbc0d9f1ebaccae68c706e1898d22f"><gtr:id>02cbc0d9f1ebaccae68c706e1898d22f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>TAYLOR, CF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544f5fd9e47809.64740904</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L005514/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC53A3F2-81B6-40C9-874D-291D23B3C79F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
