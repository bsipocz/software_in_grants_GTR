The armed forces have themselves recognized the issue and are currently renovating command structures to overcome the problems experienced on recent operations. Specifically, western armed forces, led by the United States and supported by the UK and France, are re-investing in and reforming command at the divisional level (a formation of some 20,000 soldiers) which they have identified as decisive for future campaigns. This research aims to analyse and assess the reformation of military command at the divisional level in the 21st century. 

Emerging during the First World War and enduring for most of the 20th century, the modern 'combined armed' division was a large but simple organisation designed primarily for conventional inter-state land warfare. It consisted of combat troops supported by artillery and typically defended or attacked a small front of some ten miles against a similar opponent. The twenty-first century division is different. It is a multi-functional organization commanding diverse land, air and informational assets against hybrid enemies over a huge area. While the division remains the decisive tactical formation, it has expanded and diversified. It has consequently required a radical reformation of command.

Analysing this transformation of divisional command, the proposed project distinctively focuses not on commanders as charismatic individuals but on the social institution of command, which it locates in the relations between commanders and their staff within the headquarters, influenced by the wider chain of command. The research will show how command is collectively constituted by commanders and their staff. Specifically, the research aims to identify how decisions are made and executed by commanders and their staff together.

The research explores and tests a thesis that command has become 'post-heroic'. Precisely because divisional operations are now so complex involving multiple functions over large tracts of space and time, divisional commanders can no longer direct or lead operations personally, as they did - sometimes heroically - in the twentieth century. No single individual can coordinate this intricate organization and its functions. Divisional command has been distributed and shared so that in place of a single commander making rapid individual decisions, command boards consisting of senior officers, who advise the commander, have emerged. Decisions have become collective and even bureaucratised; staff procedures channel and structure the commander's authority. In order to unite the increasingly complex division, generalship is increasingly becoming 'post-heroic'.

The commander is still vital to a division, of course. Precisely because its functions are so complex, there must be a single and ultimate point of authority. Here, personality remains essential to a divisional command but it takes a quite different form from the 20th century. It is no longer directed so much at sustaining the morale of troops as generating partnerships with other agencies and organisations, many of which are not military. Generals are no longer simply warriors but facilitators. 

The research will test this thesis through multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork and interviews in the UK, US, France and Germany, supported by archival research. In this way, the research will identify the distinguishing features of 21st military command to identify its capabilities, its requirements and its necessary limitations. 

In this way, the research aims to contribute not only to inter-disciplinary debates in the social and political science about defence, the armed forces, war, organizations and leadership but also to contribute to policy discussions about military reform and to assist practitioners in understanding generalship today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims to benefit three constituencies: 1) Western armed forces 2) the British defence policy community 3) the British public.

1) Western Armed Forces:
Military command has been a contentious issue in the last decade and the armed forces themselves accept that failures of command have occurred. This research aims to augment current attempts by the armed forces to improve command performance, by educating British, American, French and German armies about contemporary military command. It aims to do this in three ways:

a) Reflexivity:
Professional militaries are often characterised by a very strong work ethic which can, unfortunately, be detrimental to the process of self-analysis. Armies are reforming divisional command through an intense training programme yet have spent far less time considering the question of command itself; there seems to be an assumption that the function of command is self-evident and unchanging. A series of presumptions have been made about the ideal span and function of command with no analysis of the special character of 21st century command. For instance, in many cases, British experiences from Helmand have just been projected onto the future, even though the operating environment in Afghanistan was unique. Consequently, there is a tendency to overwhelm commanders, assigning them too many units and too few deputies. This research aims to improve the military's understanding of command and, therefore, how headquarters and the forces under them might best be structured.

b) Practical Improvements:
The analysis of command necessarily involves an investigation of staff processes. The research aims to improve the divisional headquarters' ability to conduct political analysis. This is an area with which staff officers typically struggle but it is critical to effective command. I have contributed to the refinement of analytical methods in British stabilization doctrine and have used these techniques on operations in Kandahar but these methods are not widely known about or understood in the army. The research will provide an opportunity to communicate these methods to staff in divisional headquarters.

c) Fostering cross-sector co-operation and exchange:
Institutional reform is most likely to be successful by germinating and fostering an international and cross-sector network of experts and practitioners who can together collaborate with the armed forces in re-thinking and reconfiguring command. Through generating such a network, this research will create the opportunity for new intellectual and professional linkages between military professionals, scholars and policy makers. 

2. British defence policy community: 
The MOD, Whitehall and Parliament are well aware of the failings of military command in the last decade. However, they are less aware of the special difficulties of commanding military forces in the 21st century. If a sustainable defence strategy is to be developed, civilian policy-makers have to understand and have a stake in military command. By engaging with the defence-policy community and fostering new connections with the armed forces, this research aims to facilitate an improvement in command, to enhance civil understanding of the problems of military command, and to influence British defence policy debates.

3. The British public:
The vast majority of the British public are proud of their armed forces. However, they have little understanding of how the armed forces might be used effectively or the limits of their utility. Consequently, they are unable to make informed judgements about military operations and defence policy. This project aims to to inform the British public about the utility of military force (and its limits) and what they can expect from military commanders by communicating the special difficulties of command in the 21st century.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>270157</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mentor of 1 UK Division Exercise Rhino Charge, June 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6AB6760D-DE81-492F-AD19-5FA08B18EAEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by the command of I UK Division to act as a mentor on this exercise and to advise in the development of the headquarters.

However, there have been some immediate concrete impacts:

1) Personnel policy at 3 UK Division:
One of the central findings of my research is that command is more complex in the 21st century and headquarters require greater command capacity. In my engagement with 3 UK Division, it has become obvious that their personnel model based on a small complement of permanent staff (80 in total) but then augmented by about 150 further officers when exercising is unworkable. The augmentees do not understand how 3 UK Division operations and their contributions are suboptimal. Indeed, on exercises 3 UK Division wastes significant resources training up the augmentees many of whom never return. Corporate memory is lost. I have argued that 3 UK Division's permanent staff need expansion to at least 150. This paper, published in British Army Review has been used by 3 UK Division to justify an increase in personnel which has now been passed by the Army Board.

2) Understanding Command:
I have disseminated the concept of command collectivism to 3 UK Division in the course of my research engagement with them. The concept of a command team or collective has filtered into the culture of the organisation and is affirming and informing current command practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7217B545-43F7-40B7-86DE-3BAE870F1709</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b6e966a53a02.58931366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has shown that a new regime of military command has emerged in the 21st century. In the light of new operational and organisational conditions, decision cycles in the army divisions of the major western powers have multiplied. Operations now involve multiple agencies and actors which have to be coordinated over large tracts of time and space. In order to orchestrate military operations, the emergence of command collectivism is observable. In the place of individual commanders, who monopolised the decision-making process in the 20th century, command teams have emerged allowing divisional commanders to share decision-making authority with deputies, agents and proxies. The research has discovered that alternate techniques have been developed here. For instance, the US Army and British Army have introduced administrative systems and formal deputies to fulfil these roles while the US Marine Corps have sought to create densely bonded, highly cohesive command fraternities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Dialogue with users:
I am in constant dialogue with military users who are finding my work useful.

2) Publication:
I am publishing work in practitioner journals to inform contemporary debates about command. I have just had an article published in British Army Revierw on 3 UK Division, which I know has influenced policy. I have a piece accepted in the RUSI Journal which should also inform discussions about the reform of command. I am currently drafting a paper for Parameters, the journal of the US Army War College

3) Lectures:
I am being called on to give lectures internationally on command to staff colleges and military audiences.

4) Command conference:
I am organising a major practitioner-scholar conference on command in September. The delegate list which includes many prominent scholars and officers (including General Nick Carter) is now confirmed. Generals James Mattis and HR McMaster should have attended had they not been appointed to the Trump Administration. However, their initial acceptance shows the profile of the event and has usefully encouraged others to attend.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A24A7D2F-6E0B-45D1-A0F2-84AEB840C1E6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6e77a85c479.57029006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04B1E8BD-A63E-424D-8EB5-6E90B4C41D9F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Corroding the Iron Division: personnel problems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Army Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/692c6938d704efa2690b85f60be9c5d8"><gtr:id>692c6938d704efa2690b85f60be9c5d8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>KING AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b550e98258f5.20658801</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02F4B4EF-63E7-4288-BE2C-B696E867475A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sport, war and commemoration: football and remembrance in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal for Sport and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6"><gtr:id>260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>King A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa295f1aa2dd7.28729893</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08D381D6-B063-4851-A9F4-8C1929FC7910</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Deputy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The RUSI Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6"><gtr:id>260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>King A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fca1eb8f001.84873567</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC6C6A41-2E36-4C8D-BBFE-29EC30CC869E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Jack Wills crowd: towards a sociology of an elite subculture.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The British journal of sociology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6"><gtr:id>260fa42b858aee5033974fabe5a89dd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>King A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0007-1315</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa296a75ee2a1.94327909</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N007859/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39B8C78D-8933-4158-88D3-165B9F15A254</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Leadership</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A153974-B803-439F-95AD-724028C45340</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Security Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E420B429-253A-4597-91E9-199D86682755</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
