For over a century, these two goals have defined the women's peace movement and, as early as 1915, activists were calling on states to recognize that neither equality nor peace could be fully secured without acknowledging the intimate relationship between the two. In the aftermath of WWII states sought to advance these goals but through parallel international law projects starting with the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Right in 1948. Notwithstanding a plethora of efforts, progress over the last seven decades on both fronts has been patchy and partial. Across the globe, equality is far from being realized and measures to prevent conflict have all too often failed.

In 2000, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1325 when, at long last, states formally acknowledged the link between the two objectives and, in doing so, founded the UN's Women, Peace and Security Agenda (WPS Agenda). In the intervening 17 years, the Council has adopted a further seven resolutions leading to significant advances on some fronts, most notably, international action to tackle sexual violence in armed conflict. However, women's groups and scholars are increasingly doubtful that the potential for transformative change and radical reform as originally envisaged by Resolution 1325 will materialize. This scepticism is due to a number of reasons including the ambiguity of the texts of the resolutions and a lack of political commitment. The very fact that states regard the WPS agenda as a set of policy objectives rather than as a political framework founded on legal obligations means that progress is likely to be slow at best. Our project addresses these two core problems by elaborating on the legal content of the agenda. In that process, we will pave the way for what we ambitiously describe as a 'feminist international law of peace and security'. In short, this proposal represents the initial stage of a long-term vision that builds on the legacies of the past to develop the foundations and content of a feminist international law of peace and security that offers an alternative gender-sensitive account of international law that can make a real and lasting difference to the lives of women, not least those in conflict affected zones.

The project is divided into two inter-related research streams. The first focuses on the conceptual and normative ambiguities of the WPS agenda and interrogates our understandings of 'peace' and 'security' through different disciplines and traditions to craft an enriched feminist reading of what is implicated by both concepts under international law. In the second stream we turn our attention to the notion of conflict prevention and ask whether a feminist international law would open up the possibilities for a broader understanding of conflict prevention thereby providing a normative framework that more effectively delivers on prevention. Over the 3 year project cycle, we will undertake desk-based and archival research, convene workshops involving a wide range of stakeholders, including scholars from other disciplines and policy-makers and -shapers at domestic and international levels and convene a WPS Global Congress. Our dissemination strategy has been planned to maximize the impact of our findings and to reach the widest possible audience, not least women's groups operating in conflict-affected regions. We will created a one-stop global resource hub that will host our research outputs including articles for an academic audience; reports and briefing papers to assist policy-makers develop law and policies with transformative potential; advocacy and litigation tools aimed at further empowering women's groups; and comments and blogs for all audiences including, importantly, the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In developing the theoretical foundations and normative content of an international law that can more effectively deliver on gender equality and sustainable peace, our research is projected to benefit policy-makers, public sector actors, civil society organisations, legal practitioners, the media and the general public in the ways outlined below. 

Our outputs and activities will inform and assist policy-makers and public sector actors, at national and international levels, to craft strategies that more effectively deliver on the two core goals of equality and sustainable peace to which states are committed pursuant to the UN's Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The critical role of law in securing both objectives has been expressly acknowledged by states. By producing accessible studies mapping the applicable legal frameworks complemented by an enriched gender-sensitive interpretation of the relevant norms, our outputs will equip states to design and develop progressive law, policy and strategies to meet needs and obligations and to deliver on their political goals. We will provide expert analyses, insights into protection gaps, and options and recommendations that are innovative, practical and feasible. Our activities, not least the Global Congress, will offer these stakeholders an invaluable opportunity to hear directly from a broad spectrum of women's groups operating in the field.
Our outputs will enable civil society organisations, legal practitioners and the media to more effectively hold states and international organisations accountable by providing enhanced clarity as to how the multiple policy initiatives and legal regimes intersect. We will furnish additional tools, highlight good practices and develop different entry points to enhance the ability of those involved in advocacy and litigation work to influence policy and secure implementation. Through the Global Congress we will bring together activists from a cross-section of professions including academics, advocates and litigators from around the world to promote knowledge exchange. In particular, our free and open-access one-stop resource website will assist women activists in conflict and post-conflict environments to better understand what mechanisms and tools are available and how to utilize them to secure improved rights protection. Our publications and activities will provide the media with expert knowledge, alternative perspectives (including the lived experience of women in conflict and conflict-affected areas), pinpoint protection gaps, and identify the linkages between international ambitions and local impact thereby equipping them to better inform public opinion.

Our research will contribute to the social and intellectual capital of the expanding global knowledge economy by enhancing public awareness and understanding of the ways in which international law can be harnessed to better secure gender equality and sustainable peace for all. Around the world there has been a rising tide of women's movements calling for change and thus our outputs and activities will complement, advance and prompt further debate, participation and engagement among the general public. Working in collaboration with the third sector we will promote a deeper appreciation of our shared history through the prism of women's peace movements across time and space and develop new directions in representing the interplay between law and history.

As this project will be embedded with the LSE's WPS Centre, it will consolidate the School's reputation as a leading global research and resource hub on women, peace and security thereby presenting UK-based researchers at the forefront of debate and shapers of policy in these critical areas of public and political concern.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>724533</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R007306/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F067D65B-ECCC-4470-B65D-3D66E2CB0032</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Legal History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
