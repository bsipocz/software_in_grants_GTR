However, the rise of return migrants has challenged this traditional dominant focus. Drawing on knowledge-based perspective and embeddedness theory, this research goes beyond the existing literature by examining the impact of return migrants on international knowledge spillovers and innovation of local Chinese firms and multinational enterprises (MNEs).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The key findings show that Chinese return migrants with socio-cultural embeddededness who possess advanced technology and new ideas act as a new channel for international knowledge diffusion and that there are reverse knowledge flows from local Chinese firms to foreign firms that operate in China. The research will make theoretical contributions and provide new insights into the new phenomenon of return migrants. The outcomes of the proposed project will also be highly relevant to both policy makers and practitioners and will have strategic managerial implications.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43551</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have contributed to the Chinese government policy toward returnee migrants.

One set of findings show that firms led by returnee migrants are more innovative as they have high R&amp;amp;D intensity and produce more patents than non-returnee firms. However, they have low new product sales, compared with non-returnee firms. We examined the reasons behind performance differences between returnee firms and non-returnee firms. Empirical evidence shows that returnee-led firms have low technology commercialisation capability and low marketing orientation. Our findings implicitly suggest that return migrants may face difficulties and challenges to exploit their technological advantages when operating in their home country. Our findings also reveal 'the dark side' of innovation. Innovation orientation is a necessary condition, but not sufficient to lead to a high level of firm performance. Technology commercialisation capability and marketing capability are more crucial to firm success than innovation itself. Hence, our findings broaden the concept of innovation and call for more emphasis on innovation-related activities, such as technology commercialization and marketing capability. We also investigated the role of return migrants in the reverse knowledge spillovers from local firms to foreign firms that operate in China. Our findings show that the impact of reverse knowledge spillovers becomes much stronger in the presence of returnee managers. Our findings suggest that knowledge is embedded in social structure and in communities of practitioners. Hence, obtaining external knowledge requires socio-cultural embeddedness in local environments, and interaction with local firms. This aspect has been largely underexplored in prior literature. Moreover, complex knowledge is 'sticky' even within tight social networks so returnees in foreign firms act as boundary spanners and help to reduce barriers to the absorption of external knowledge. Our results imply that having local presence and developing local linkages may be necessary conditions, but not sufficient conditions, for reverse knowledge spillovers. The real effect of embeddedness is attached to managers and employees who have special characteristics. In our case, returnees, as boundary spanners, are able to connect foreign firms with local firms more effectively. Our findings draw particular attention to the social dimensions of knowledge spillovers, especially the socio-cultural embeddedness of employees and managers whose special characteristics play an important role in reverse knowledge spillovers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A symposium on innovation was organised at the School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University on 2nd May 2012. The audience consisted of Japanese managers from Microsoft Japan, Sanyan Japan, Astra Zeneca UK, and local entrepreneurs and managers in East Midlands, as well as academics. Professor Liu presented the key findings from the project. Participants were really interested in possible knowledge flows between UK MNEs and local Chinese firms and how return migrants help to generate knowledge flows. Some participants felt that there was much to learn from the symposium on how academics and business practitioners could work together nationwide and globally to enhance innovation and introduce innovations into the market. Dr Lu was invited to give a talk on the impact of returnees and policy implications derived from this project in the Beijing Overseas Talents Center, a government agency in charge of returnee issues in Beijing, on 22nd June, 2012. More than 40 staff of the center, including the director and three deputy directors, attended this seminar. The audience was informed about both the advantages and challenges of returnee migrants and how relevant government agencies could provide support and create a platform which enables returnee firms and local non-returnee firms to work together. Professor Liu gave a keynote speech at the International Forum on Innovation Oriented Economics on 14 September 2012 in Chongqing, China. The forum was co-organised by Chongqing Association of Science and Technology, ESRC and University of East Angelia. Prof. Liu was interviewed by the Chongqing Business Newspaper about her insights into performance differences between returnee-led firms and local Chinese firms in Zhongguancun Science Park.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74E56A4C-DA12-40B5-9C81-D642174D4984</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r_3363011227b2f35892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government/ Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>47A05AA3-B939-4BCE-B50F-119137202857</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marketing capabilities, technology capabilities and the financial performance of returnee firms in China</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57ba0a7501779954dd02d35c27835b40"><gtr:id>57ba0a7501779954dd02d35c27835b40</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xiaohui Liu (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_1334109505cb94d550</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F6F8BED5-47F0-4691-8FCC-2789907F1C62</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chinese Migrants and their Impact on Homeland Development</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The World Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/74c7527dc2bbf15fadf582ed815befa6"><gtr:id>74c7527dc2bbf15fadf582ed815befa6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wei Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5899d49436a1a0.93175531</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B2BB287-7724-478A-A74E-F7A883A4DE76</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bridging Knowledge Gaps: Returnees and Reverse Knowledge Spillovers from Chinese Local Firms to Foreign Firms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Management International Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/42f7c7c6107a6cd7198876022cb295cf"><gtr:id>42f7c7c6107a6cd7198876022cb295cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Liu X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf8ef8e3dcb2dc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BEE03DE8-BAC1-4027-8F8D-46C4084F3711</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chinese Migrants and their Impact on Homeland Development</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6c748898140b552597b3ef04d9cbec4a"><gtr:id>6c748898140b552597b3ef04d9cbec4a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yingqi  Wei (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9284095908cb12dfd2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-238-25-0027</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I034897/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
