It questions the over-use of labels such as 'art' or 'popular' cinema and proposes the 'middlebrow' as a new way of approaching Spanish film. First, it argues for the existence of Spanish 'middlebrow cinema', and suggests that middlebrow films have been central to the development of Spanish film history. This new focus illuminates the connections between a number of tendencies in Spanish cinema from the 1960s to the present. Thus, the so-called 'Third Way' cinema of the 1970s, state-subsidized literary adaptations known collectively as 'Mir&amp;oacute;' films in the 1980s, 'heritage' cinema of the 1990s, or 'popular auteurs', like Pedro Almod&amp;oacute;var, of the 1990s and 2000s, will all be reconsidered as examples of Spanish middlebrow cinema. Second, this project proposes the 'middlebrow' as a new methodological approach to Spanish film, which analyses, rather than condemns, the way such cinema lies in-between 'art' or 'popular' alternatives. Pierre Bourdieu, who has developed a theory of the middlebrow in connection with the French context, will offer a theoretical model for this approach. Third, this project focuses on the rise of Spain's middle classes from the 1960s onwards, and suggests that a new 'middlebrow' cinema developed to satisfy the tastes of these new mainstream audiences. \n\nThe research will lead to the publication of 'A New History of Spanish Cinema', which will contain an introduction and six chapters. In the Introduction, I will argue for the importance of examining historical contexts in any analysis of Spanish cinema. However, instead of focusing on political events, like the death of Franco in 1975, I argue for the importance of socio-economic contexts. As such, the historical background I examine will highlight Spain's similarities with, rather than differences from, other Western nations (the importance of the middle class, rather than a focus on repressive dictatorship, althougit will be noted that industrialization occurred far later in Spain than elsewhere). In this introduction I will also reject the negative connotations of the term 'middlebrow', and sketch a framework for its analysis using the theories of French sociologist Bourdieu. In chapter one, which focuses on the 1960s, I will address the treatment of this new ascendant class in diverse Spanish films, and trace the emergence of 'middlebrow' film in the period, for example with La gran familia (Palacios 1962), which focuses on a quintessential middle-class Madrid family. Chapter two, covering the 1970s, will address 'Third Way' cinema, and will argue that this should be considered as central to cultural expression in the period, rather than a marginal alternative to the political auteur films and crude commercial cinema which attract greater critical attention. When considering the 1980s, in chapter three, I will develop my previously published work on the state-subsidized cinema of democratic Spain's socialist government, known as the 'Mir&amp;oacute;' films. Previous histories of Spanish cinema argue that directors and producers from the 1990s onwards have turned their backs on the 'Mir&amp;oacute;' legacy. By addressing 'heritage' cinema and reconsidering the recent work of 'popular auteurs', such as Almod&amp;oacute;var (for instance in La flor de mi secreto [1995]), I will conclude that a concern to satisfy 'mainstream' audiences, through films which I argue are 'middlebrow', runs as a constant thread through this period of Spanish film history. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I have planned the following pathways to social and cultural impact beyond academia. (1), (2) and (3) are aimed at the film-going public in the UK; (4) is aimed at the film-going public in Spain; (5) is aimed at teachers of Spanish cinema in Anglophone countries who are not part of the group of 'Academic Beneficiaries'. \n\n1. Talks at Film Festivals\n\nI have previously disseminated the results of my research on 1960s Spanish Cinema (also funded by the AHRC through the matched leave scheme) by speaking at a Film Festival entitled 'Spain (Un)censored' at the British Film Institute (January 2008). Having already established contacts with this organization, I will contact them in 2011 with a view to speaking at a festival or Spanish film event in 2012. \nI will also approach organizers of the UK's two annual Spanish film festivals, '!Viva! Spanish and Latin American Film Festival' (Manchester) and the 'London Spanish Film Festival', to suggest I deliver similar introductions or lectures. \nI will furthermore approach Exeter's Picture House to investigate whether Exeter could host either of these film festivals on tour ('!Viva!' has previously toured to Bristol and London). \n\n2. Study Days linked to Film Festivals\n\nI have previously disseminated the results of my research on 1960s Spanish Cinema by speaking at a Study Day as part of the Film Festival at the British Film Institute described above. This event was aimed at the wider public, including teachers of Spanish cinema and A-level students. I will contact this organization again with a view to hosting similar events. If Exeter Picture House is successful in attracting a Spanish film festival on tour to this city, I would aim to host a similar Study Day here. \n\n3. Public Lecture in the UK\n\nI have previously disseminated the results of my research on Literary Adaptations in Spanish Cinema (funded by the AHRB through a postgraduate award) by speaking at a public lecture at Canning House (November 2002). Having already established contacts with this organization, I will contact them in 2011 with a view to speaking on the subject of this new project in 2012. \n\n4. Public Lecture in Spain\n\nI have already established contacts with the Spanish Film Archives (Filmoteca Espa&amp;ntilde;ola, Madrid) - the Head of the Film Collection and the Chief Librarian are official partners of this research project. This organization regularly hosts films screenings and book launches. In 2011 I will approach them about hosting such an event to tie in with the publication of my book in 2012.\n\n5. Impact on Syllabus Development\n\nBy shifting our focus on Spanish cinema to a new area, a final objective of this project is to impact on syllabus development in Higher Education and at A-level. This research will reach this potential audience in the academic year following the book's publication (the manuscript will be submitted in 2011, the book will be published in 2012, thus, 2013-14). To help meet this objective, my publisher will market my book widely to institutions that teach Spanish cinema. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65936</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The 2011 P?rez Gald?s Lecture: 'Gald?s and Spanish Cinema'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEB77AEF-2088-4500-BF83-D04AA72E4B81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This annual lecture, currently in its eleventh year, is endowed by the Spanish Embassy and hosted by the University of Sheffield.

As anticipated, this term has enabled me to offer an original interpretation of this national cinema. The early chapters describe a cinema concerned with narratives of social mobility; the central chapter, on the hinge decade of the 1970s, details the shift from films about middlebrow culture (especially prominent in the 1950s and 1960s) to films that are themselves examples of that middlebrow culture. The final chapters confirm the insights offered by this focus on the middlebrow to the present day. The research has also revealed that a historical examination of the rise of the middle classes is crucial, in order to place these cultural developments in context. The order of chapters is as follows. Each chapter contains close readings of six key films. The manuscript was submitted in summer 2012 and published in 2013.
