This digital footprint constitutes their digital identity, i.e. their Digital Personhood. Currently, personhood data is fragmented, residing in various repositories across the Internet. It has been considered to be part of the data commons that the 'Big 3' Internet Companies -- Google, Facebook, Twitter-- and other similar organisations have been freely data mining, analysing and, crucially, monetizing. Google, for example, captures data about its search engine users and monetizes it to generate most of its revenue from advertisers who are interested in reaching out to Google's online users. A shortcoming of this advertisement centric business model is that technology intermediaries capture only a small subset of Digital Personas rather than an individual's entire personal data record or Digital Personhood. Furthermore, the individual whose personal data is being monetized by third-parties has no control on the collection process and the subsequent exploitation of his/her digital personhood data. 

The challenge of this bold and disruptive proposal is to empower citizen prosumers -- citizens who both produce and consume data -- by utilising and exploiting the economic value of their digital self in a new tradeable 'futures market' in personhoods. Specifically the project will develop a 'micro-Persona eXchange', building persona futures products and management system applications to enable prosumers to monetize their personhood data. The success of this project will stimulate world leading research activity concerning the design of persona products and trading processes, including the ongoing development of novel intelligent data analysis techniques for mining digital personhood data.

The project will also consider how a 'futures market' for digital personhood data will be established in legal terms. Who owns an individual's digital personhood data is currently a moot point, with questions such as the suitability of property rights vs privacy rights to ensure data protection. Both organisations and the legal infrastructure need to accommodate this shift for the successful development of sustainable prosumer-centric business and economic models. The legal framework will notably ensure that the prosumer will be able to choose a curator (i.e a digital prosumer trading assistant) who will act as an intermediary between them and the micro-Persona eXchange when trading. With this in mind, the research will propose a draft for a Prosumer Protection Act.

The project has the potential to unlock substantial economic value for the UK Digital Economy, generating new revenue streams, and redistributing wealth in favour of the prosumer. The UK will have an opportunity to take the lead in establishing an innovative international futures market and thus be a global player, leader and innovator in what could be a key emerging industry i.e. Digital Prosumer Futures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research will impact on a diverse set of beneficiaries outside the academic community.

The general public, i.e. the prosumers -whether an individual or a business- will be able to monetize their digital personhood data in a new tradable 'futures' market in digital persona products. A prosumer-centric business model will provide new opportunities for new entrants in the market space traditionally occuppied by the 'Big 3' Internet companies - Google, Facebook, Twitter - which is based on their so far unfettered access and use of the prosumer's personhood data. Wealth will be redistributed in favour of the prosumer and the current organisational cultures and practices will be modified so as to take into account the prosumer's new economic power.

Within the business and industry sectors, the project's creation of a micro-Persona Exchange will lead to a disintermediation of current practices and a renewed intermediation, with distinctive business and economic models emerging, centred on the prosumer. Building on the open source software delivered by the project (with appropriate licensing), novel exchange start ups will appear alongside existing exchange organisations that will also benefit from these new business opportunities. Product and service suppliers such as Panasonic, as well as the suppliers of global IT digital technology infrastructures will be able to launch innovative products and services.

To accommodate the micro-Persona eXchange and this prosumer economy, redefining the legal framework will be essential to the project. Public policy and legislation on data protection, consumer protection, financial services regulation, will be affected. The project will notably explore the need for a Prosumer Protection Act in order to fairly balance the interests of the different stakeholders of the Digital Economy: the prosumer, the big companies of the digitial economy, and the Government. The project will also generate new tax revenues streams for the Government.

At the heart of this new business and economic model for prosumption, will be the protection of digital personhood data, a significant Cyber Security research challenge. In addition to the business analytics and intelligence opportunities, there are possibilities for intelligence harvesting in order to identify and defend the micro-Persona eXchange against Cyber attacks and international terrorist threats which have been identified as a 'tier one' risk in the National Security Strategy.

The project will provide the UK an opportunity to take the lead in establishing an innovative micro-Persona eXchange for a Digital Persona Futures Market, which has the potential to become a key industry at home and ultimately, beyond the UK national borders. By engaging its economic partners into an European and international Digital Prosumer Futures market, the project will impact on the European and US exchange organisations as well as on the supervisors involved in establishing banking and financial services regulations and policies, such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the US Securities Exchange Commission.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>645923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Government Office for Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborative design, participation and evaluation of Digital Prosumer Trading Platform</gtr:description><gtr:id>F9D96A78-3420-4F85-BE88-B4D8CA65B1D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Extending the development of the main experimental design specification in order to (i) provide a better understanding of the commodification of our own data, (ii) how a market experiment could provide a better understanding of the net value of data through the sum of a Price of a Problem versus the Value of Privacy, and (iii) the development of aspirational personas that encourage positive behaviour as a result of commodification of personal data i.e. incentivising people to drive persona-based positive behaviours.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6089ee86569.90371309-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Informing the research and experimental design to enhance the outputs of the forthcoming Tech Trials conducted under the auspices of the Digital Catapult's personal Data and Trust Network and our own main trading experiment.

The presentation lasted twenty minutes and covered several points: data as object of trade (the project's choice to use database rights), the checkpoints for privacy and consent in the project, and the project's more general aim to trade futures. The questions/feedback hardly focused on the project. It seems that the points made were accepted as legally sound. The questions were mostly on the ecosystem surrounding the data vaults: rights on data, disparity of power between consumers/individuals and IT companies setting up vaults and how to avoid further discrimination and inequalities, role of insurance companies regarding risks and how to assess risks, role of the law to set the boundaries by reference to contract law, labour law and consumer law, with the latter two being seen as an attempt by the law to reinstate some balance into a fundamental equal relationship between individuals and companies.

SYNOPSIS
Renewable energy prosumers are citizens who consume and produce renewable energy for self-consumption or to sell back to a grid. As more and more households embrace renewable energy sources, the question that nevertheless remains is how prosumers maximise their pecuniary benefits from exchanging their micro-generated renewable energy surpluses, say among a local community, and/or trading their associated personal energy behavioural data? In particular, this talk focuses on the role of Big Data Analytics for a Digital Prosumer Trading Platform that empowers prosumers to control and trade their personal energy behavioural data as a futures product.

As a result of this presentation, I was invited to contribute to the development of a 'New Model for Energy' in Phase 2 of the Future Power Systems Architecture activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca953aac56c8.65008144</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theiet.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Personhood Network meeting 9-10 September  2015 Headingley</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>955A5787-5D4D-4EB6-99B3-871B0529BE8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop/meeting of all the EPSRC DPN/EMOTICON funded projects to present progress and outputs of projects, as well as look at future steps and collaboration opportunities.

A representative from the European Data Protection Supervisor (regulator at EU level) was also present. Among the themes discussed, were: data as object of trade, aspects of privacy and data protection, trading and legal structure of the MX. The feedback centered around four points. Firstly, the project was well received and seen as a step forward in the field of data markets. Secondly, the privacy policy and the checkpoints for privacy and consent as part of the curation process to protect the prosumer were well received and confirmed as the step forward. Thirdly, the trading rulebooks were accepted. Lastly, the workshop showed a strong division between property rights and privacy rights on data, with many feeling un at ease to grant property rights on data. The outcome of the workshop was an invitation to present project and ideas at Brussels by EDPS on 25 January 2016, as part of the EDPS work on data vaults (in progress) and digital ethics (published).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5ec8e3cbec6.94521335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://digitalprosumer.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/trading-in-big-data-how-should-its-extraction-be-regulated/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IT as a Utility Conference 6-7 July 2015 Southampton University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F6D902E-C476-421C-839A-82B0C5C0BE75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and talk on DP project.

1. Strengthening trust in EU data protection law: the use of contextual integrity for a more informed and transparent legal analysis (Audrey Guinchard, University of Essex)
2. Trading big data: power back to the individual? The potentials of establishing a futures market in data' (Audrey Guinchard, University of Essex; Panos Louvieris, Brunel University)
The first presentation presents the project of trading big data as a means to reinstate power to the individual. The focus will be on the five checkpoints established to facilitate informed consent to big data analytics and trading.

The second presentation relates to a paper to be submitted to the European Law Review, one of the key law journals in EU law. The paper argues that trust in EU data protection law can be strengthened, should the American framework of analysis of contextual integrity be used to structure the EU legal analysis. To determine the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate data flows, the decision-maker must follow a number of preliminary steps before engaging with the proportionality analysis. These two steps implicitly underpin the EU decisional process in the DPD and future GDPR, and the CJEU' own analysis. However, the EU data protection law approach remains intuitive. CI brings to the foreground the elements and thus guides the legal inquiry along recognizable elements that can be evaluated and re-evaluated in later decisions, bringing increased transparency, coherence and predictability to the current and future EU decisional process in data protection.

Outcomes: David Omand (Sir David Omand was the first UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator, etc) highlighted the disruptiveness of the Digital Prosumer project and enquired about the required scale for this. We do not have those figures but an idea of take-up will be established through the experiments planned. Further, we have had follow-on discussions with Simon Stokes (partner) of Blake Morgan regarding collaboration in future projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca65027bb5c3.94020891</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/Law/Centre%20for%20Information%20Rights/Pages/-TRILCon17.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Development of Personal Data Indices</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD3E878B-5999-488D-8108-4C50FEF95C9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim is to develop economic indices that measure the value of personal data and to explore their implications in terms of sharing of information and economic impact

The online trading platform has several layers linked through a common interface (available at https://digitalprosumer.co.uk). The layers of the DP Platform include: 
a) Digital Vault: the Hadoop-based personal data storage facility where intelligent data mining takes place to identify personas across prosumer data.
b) Digital Exchange: the Java-based platform where the auction and matching of personal data takes place.
c) Legal Framework: developed and validated by legal experts to give prosumers the ownership and protection for trading their personal data. 
This platform has been used within a series of pilot experiments using the student population to firstly test the platform in a real world trading scenario, and also to identify the level of user empowerment and disruptiveness to the current data markets (i.e. Google, Facebook). The findings from these initial experiments show that prosumers' empowerment utility when using the DP Platform and trading for money is higher than when using free services provided by the likes of Google and giving their data away for free. More experiments will be held over the next three months, including a session with members from the Community of Interest within the Data Science Partnership (Government Office for Science, Office for National Statistics, Government Digital Service) and the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy, in order to establish statistically significant findings from a wider sample population. Having the involvement of participants from the Government Departments in the Data Science Partnership will facilitate robust testing and expert evaluation of the Digital Prosumer Trading Platform, as well as obtaining a view on the relevance and national impact of the Platform for the UK Government.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To inform stakeholders/collaborators involved in advising or engaging in the creation and use of Personal data trading services including use of the Digital Prosumer Trading Platform.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35B86346-9B3F-4284-81DC-2F7A1DAF71F9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464e30209d1d2.15605112</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://digitalprosumer.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>IP Trading Platforms for the Intellectual Property Office</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7ACE707-7308-4854-8537-CEDB114C92CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6ad65d0f267.28047096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The aim is to develop an economic model for the behaviour of prosumers in selling personal data</gtr:description><gtr:id>F314764A-3BCB-406F-97D2-5808E8350D0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of new economic models with the aim of publishing academic journals</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462215d547f70.50793644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Economic Model for the Behaviour of Prosumers</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In an increasingly digital world, our interactions with systems and devices across the Internet generate a significant amount of data. This personal data provides valuable information about the different facets of our lives and many are becoming increasingly aware of just how much it is utilised by organisations. In the majority of cases, citizens agree to allowing their personal information to be used in exchange for access to free services and/or discounts. The EPSRC funded Digital Prosumer project seeks to empower citizens by developing a personal data exchange that allows citizens to trade personal data in exchange for real money. The aim of this survey is to understand citizens' preferences in respect of a personal data exchange and consists of two parts: (1) questions regarding the current situation where use of personal data is in exchange for access to free services,(2) questions relating to a future scenario where personal data can be traded in exchange for real money.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6A3F507-B8B8-4C1D-9D9F-C4482C8EEFE1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication in progress exploring the data types prosumers are willing to trade.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6d877400708.26331820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Digital Prosumer Personal Data Survey</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://brunel.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/digitalprosumer_data</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Digital Prosumer trading platform (the application) empowers citizen prosumers to realise the value of their personal data via a trading platform to establish a tradeable futures market in personal data.
