Despite internal and environmental fluctuations these &amp;quot;chemical reaction networks&amp;quot; (CRNs) often reliably perform some task. In biology, understanding this robustness is key to understanding processes such as metabolism and signalling, and thus to understanding disease; in chemical and biochemical engineering it is central to the design and control of reactors, and to minimising inefficiency and energy losses. 

While robustness is often found, instabilities can also be observed in CRNs. Sometimes instability can be catastrophic - chemical engineering disasters can often be traced to an unpredicted instability; but instability may also be useful - the role of calcium oscillations in biological signalling is a familiar example. The experimental and mathematical literature in this area provides numerous examples which illustrate the complex and sometimes counterintuitive behaviour of CRNs, and the need for more &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; theory to inform us on their behaviour. 

Some insight can be gained by simulating computer models of CRNs. But the limitations of this approach are illustrated by the fact that there are some well-known - and surprisingly small - systems of chemical reactions for which it is unknown whether there exists some choice of reaction rates (kinetics) at which the system can display &amp;quot;switching&amp;quot; behaviour or oscillation. The reason is that simulation, while extremely useful, can only provide information for some fixed kinetics. On the other hand, practical difficulties in experimental measurement mean that precise kinetic data is often not available for a CRN. Global theory fills the gap, begin able to explain reaction network behaviours from network structure. Recently, work in this area has seen some difficult problems reduced to simple, rapid calculation. 

The aim of this project is to develop an important area in the global theory of chemical reaction networks. A key feature of this work will be to make minimal assumptions about the rates of reactions, and thus to derive conclusions based largely on qualitative knowledge of the interactions. A powerful body of mathematical theory, the theory of monotone dynamical systems, will provide the main tool for the analysis of CRNs. This requires both development of new areas within the theory, and imaginative application of the what is already available. Theoretical work, development of algorithms from the theory, and application to experimentally studied systems, will all be important components of the work to be undertaken.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first and foremost impact will be on areas of science and applied mathematics: this work should have significant short to medium term impact on research communities working at the interfaces between mathematics, biology, chemistry and engineering. A number of steps will be taken to maximise the impact across communities, including publication in journals for different audiences, and presentation of the work at a variety of conferences. A one day workshop on chemical reaction network theory will be organised, and advertised widely. 

Long term economic impact will come via the impacts on the life-sciences and engineering. The importance of global &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; approaches of the kind in this proposal has been highlighted by the research councils, for example the EPSRC grand challenge &amp;quot;Systems chemistry: exploring the chemical roots of biological organisation&amp;quot;, and the BBSRC priority &amp;quot;systems approach to biological research&amp;quot;. Work in this area has already proved its ability to explain, to predict, and to suggest testable hypotheses for experimental work. It is beginning to provide a framework for the understanding of modularity in biology, namely how complex network behaviours emerge from the interconnection of simpler, well-understood components. The proposed work opens up exciting possibilities in synthetic biology for the design of reaction networks with prescribed properties. A coherent body of theory on the behaviour of systems of chemical reactions also has the potential to inform on practical questions of reactor efficiency and design in engineering. The concrete possibilities for collaboration with bio/chemical engineers will be explored during the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100192</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>West Virginia University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with West Virginia University (General themes in chemical reaction network theory)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E814704-DB8D-42B8-91AD-90E1333DF311</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs are:

The work built on work done during my EPSRC award including the study of monotone chemical reaction networks. 

Abstract: Oscillation is known to occur in a great variety of biological contexts, from the natural rhythms of &amp;quot;body clocks&amp;quot; and ovulation, biochemical oscillations in cellular signalling, the cyclic nature of various diseases, cyclic behaviour in Lotka-Volterra-type models of interacting populations, and so forth. A key question is: which underlying networks, be they biochemical, ecological, etc. permit (stable) oscillation? Can we tell from the network topology whether oscillation should be observed? 

Several necessary conditions for oscillation in network dynamical systems are available, and these partial results often involve (the absence of) &amp;quot;positivity&amp;quot; in one sense or another. The focus in this talk is on oscillation in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) which are at the root of much biological oscillation, but can also be interpreted to include apparently different model classes, such as population models in ecology and gene-interaction networks. 

One approach which provides conclusions about oscillation involves the use of monotone dynamical systems. If we can identify that a dynamical system (modelled via ODEs) is a monotone system, in the sense that some partial order on its trajectories is preserved by the evolution, this provides a sufficient condition to rule out stable oscillation of the system. The complicating factor is that the partial order in question may not be a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; order, and indeed CRNs have often been observed to preserve non-standard partial orders. Nevertheless, some computational and theoretical tools are available for identifying CRNs as monotone systems and thus ruling out stable oscillation.

A complementary class of approaches involves examining certain polynomials, generally occurring as minors (or combinations of minors) of various symbolic matrices associated with a dynamical system. To be more specific, these polynomials arise from powers or compounds of the Jacobian matrix of the system. Showing positivity of these polynomials is sufficient to rule out Hopf bifurcation, and hence the most likely pathway to oscillation. Sometimes, we may even infer positivity of the polynomials from various combinatorial conditions on the network, leading to a nice interplay between graph-theoretic and algebraic approaches.

I will describe some theoretical and computational results on Hopf bifurcation and oscillation in dynamical systems with network structure, including some results from a large study of small CRNs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5176a30a020.81442163</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.posta2016.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Some results on nonexpansive dynamical systems with applications to chemical reaction networks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38F5633F-7156-4A11-BCFE-001F2B1D7887</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Applied Mathematics seminar at the University of Leicester</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9ba48e1bd39.99796626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Monotonicity, nonexpansivity and chemical reaction networks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>651983CD-EF37-4435-A7EE-278FDB44B547</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a technical talk given by Pete Donnell (the research associate on the EPSRC grant) to the mathematics department at West Virginia University where he was visiting Casian Pantea.

However, this area of research has potential for considerable impact. Some of our papers and software produced during the EPSRC grant have had significant impact on research in this area, with the potential for impact beyond research communities. Most important amongst the outputs is the open source, web-based, tool we have produced (CoNtRol) allowing a non-expert user to get a rigorous, detailed, structure-based analysis of an arbitrary reaction network (up to size limitations). This opens up the possibility that experimental scientists/ engineers will begin to use this tool as a precursor to numerical work or experimentation. This structural analysis potentially allows more interesting questions to be asked, and can lead to more targeted numerical/ experimental work. While I am not aware of direct societal or economic impacts so far, the choice to focus considerable effort on building a powerful, user-friendly, cross-platform piece of software, greatly enhances the possibility of long-term impact.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C69F72C3-F79F-4FC8-A8E8-589D509853A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5463cae7c4c924.40297832</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>With my research associate and collaborators, I have developed tools to identify families of chemical reaction networks (CRNs - these might occur, for example, as subnetworks in living cells) with behaviour restricted by the property of being &amp;quot;monotone&amp;quot;. These tools are both theoretical (we have proved that certain families necessarily are monotone); and algorithmic - we have written programs which are able to search for networks (upto certain size limitations) which are monotone. We were able to characterise those families which were monotone in certain ways (e.g. preserved &amp;quot;simplicial orders&amp;quot;), but were not successful in finding a complete characterisation in terms of network structure in general: however our attempts in this direction have convinced us that this is a difficult problem, and that there may never be a simple computable condition both necessary and sufficient to identify a network as monotone. 

In addition to the work on identifying monotone chemical reaction networks, we have explored the implications of monotonicity combined with other commonly occurring features of chemical systems. This mathematical work has allowed us to prove that systems with certain combinations of features necessarily have very simple behaviour which does not depend on initial data or kinetic parameters. Networks with such simple behaviour provide the natural &amp;quot;building blocks&amp;quot; of more complex networks and provide insight into how, for example, biological networks can be controlled to encourage or discourage some particular behaviour. 

My collaborators and I have also tackled a number of related questions on chemical networks, complementary to questions about monotonicity. With co-workers at Imperial, I did delicate and mathematically nontrivial work on necessary features for a chemical oscillator; and I have also been consolidating earlier strands of work identifying reaction networks which permit/ forbid multiple equilibria. Recently, with a co-worker at Kent, I have been developing theorems which can be broadly described as &amp;quot;thermodynamical&amp;quot; which explain a number of earlier results on CRNs as a consequence of a single feature, nonexpansivity with respect to an appropriate norm.

Finally, the applications-oriented work has also inspired some elegant new mathematical theory (mainly in combinatorics, and in analysis) which has a life of its own beyond the applications. I have found, for example, interesting new results on qualitative matrices and graphs, and on the number and stability of equilibria in classes of dynamical systems which need not arise from chemistry. This work, which has been presented at conferences aimed mainly at pure mathematicians, has publicised the fact that chemical reaction networks are an application which generates interesting and nontrivial mathematical questions, potentially opening the door for the influx of more mathematicians into the area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work is already well-regarded and referred to in academic communities. Several of our theoretical results quite naturally lend themselves to development and generalisation, and we expect this to happen during the coming two-three years. In some cases we have theorems which have proved hard to cast as algorithms (namely where checking that a given CRN satisfies conditions of the theorem is algorithmically nontrivial), and we expect to see work on this occurring on the future. 

Regarding non-academic communities, we believe that publicising the algorithmic side of our work is the most important route towards impact. To this end we published a short paper in Bioinformatics aimed at experimental/ systems biologists (rather than mathematicians), describing this algorithmic work. We expect to see analysis via CoNtRol (our web-based platform for the autamated analysis of CRNs) figuring as a precursor to experimental studies, and also to see its batch-processing capabilities generating new hypotheses about CRNs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E14A29B0-D257-4767-BB3A-6FCADDB43BCE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463d799485be2.96556933</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a collaboratively developed wiki on chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) which came about as a consequence of discussions at SIAM Life Sciences 2012. The goal is to provide an ever-expanding source of basic reference material on CRNT. The main technical development of the wiki, and initial material was provided by Pete Donnell as part of the EPSRC grant. Subsequently a number of experts in CRNT have contributed modules. The wiki also links to, and provides documentation for, the CRN analysis system, CoNtRol.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D955395-BF22-469D-BFD1-CDA42E03B8FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Anecdotally, the wiki has become widely used in the CRNT community. This was visible recently at a CRNT workshop in Portsmouth, where we found that a variety of academics from the UK, Europe and North America all regularly use it as a reference tool when writing papers in this area. One expected long term result is a harmonisation of language and basic assumptions across CRNT research communities with somewhat different frameworks and histories, allowing greater scope for collaboration and communication between these communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460ae7e686af8.01151210</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mathematics of Reaction Networks (wiki)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reaction-networks.net/wiki/Mathematics_of_Reaction_Networks</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>CoNtRol is an open source, web-based (and hence platform independent) framework for analysis of chemical reaction networks (CRNs), designed to be both extensible and simple to use. It currently includes a Java-based tool to visualise DSR graphs, and implements a number of necessary and/or sufficient structural tests for multiple equilibria, stable periodic orbits, convergence to equilibria, persistence, etc. and is coded in C, Java, Octave and PHP. As the front-end is web-based, the complexity of the underlying platform is hidden from the user. It also provides a visualisation tool which can produce the so-called DSR graph of a reaction system, and implements some graph theoretic analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>126F3001-769C-4E3B-AA03-FBD0023CF9E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool, which is under continuous development, has become quite widely used within the chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) community. Development has also been opened up to the wider community and modules have subsequently been added by researchers not originally part of the development team. The goal is both to allow new results which naturally take algorithmic forms to be made widely available, and to provide an open source alternative to some of the closed source CRN analysis software currently available. We expect long term impact to be significant.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8177736744.450166fd5c87c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>CoNtRol: Chemical Reaction Network analysis
