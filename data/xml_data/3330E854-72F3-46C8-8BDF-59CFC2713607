cross-curricular teaching in Primary and Secondary schools</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N003543/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Grand Designs in Ancient Greece follows on from AHRC Research leave to write the book, Building, Dwelling, and Living in Ancient Greece, a detailed study of ancient Greek domestic architecture that articulates ideas on embodied learning and the role of bodily practices on identity formation. In this publication, I made three key arguments which are the starting point for this project; firstly, our comprehension of life in Ancient Greece is richer if we understand how individuals, households and communities organised themselves to construct the houses in which they lived rather than only seeing them as the places in which activities took place; secondly, digital technologies and quantitative analysis offer exciting opportunities to enhance how we see and make sense of the ancient world; and thirdly the tasks of daily life and experiences in the home caused bodily transformations that affected people's quality of life and altered perception of self and the economic productivity of the household.

A fourth major driver in the development of this project, which was an unplanned consequence of my research leave, is the success of teaching an undergraduate module on Classical houses and households. Students examine Classical houses, in both group work and independent guided learning to explore broad ranging themes including display and consumption, hygiene and sanitation, gendered spaces in the home and identity formation. Significantly, students develop their skills of digital technology (using social media to communicate within groups working on the same archaeological site and SketchUp Make to develop skills of 3D modelling, and Computer Aided Design) and quantitative data analysis using Excel to analyse household assemblages. The responses to these digital learning experiences and improvement of student performance stimulated the development of this project.

Whilst this project builds upon my previous AHRC funded research, it extends its impact beyond both academic research and university teaching. Over the course of twelve months, this project will use my research on the houses of Ancient Greece to engage and collaborate with schoolteachers and children, and third sector organisations. There are two key aims of the project. The first aim is to reach out to teachers to disseminate my research and collaborate with a selected group of teachers to create resources and enhance teaching of Ancient Greece at Key Stage (KS) 2, 3 and 4 and as a consequence promote interest in the study of the Greek and Roman worlds, and to enhance the provision of Classical Civilisation at GCSE and A level. The second aim is to provide successful evidence of the benefits of integrated cross-curricular teaching for student engagement and achievement to a large international audience through the dissemination of open access resources with teacher evaluations on professional websites (TES Connect, The Guardian Education and The Historical Association) that have international readership.

In order to achieve these aims, the project will implement targeted phases of activities that are structured over a twelve-month period. These include the creation of original curricula and lesson plans by the project partners; online training of teachers in 3D modelling software; Virtual classroom visits by PI to start activities. Online workshops will enable teaching materials and practice to be evaluated and best practice will be shared. 

The project will also produce a special edition of the journal of The Classics Library including an article explaining the context of the research, lesson plans, reports by the teachers, observations on the success of the cross-curricula syllabi, and summary of the main findings of the project. The different outputs will ensure maximum impact as they are housed on open access websites that have global reach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Whilst this project builds upon my previous AHRC funded research, its impact will extend beyond both academic research and university teaching and due to the nature of the dissemination plans it will reach beyond the participants in the project and beyond UK users. 

In 12 months, the project will collaborate with at least 40 teachers and 500 school students in the 10 partner schools, as well as, a cohort of PGCE trainee teachers. Anticipated benefits for the teachers are: opportunities to collaborate on the development of cross curricula teaching; to learn about digital humanities research; to acquire skills in the use of 3D modelling and quantitative analysis for the humanities; to learn and share best practice of the cross curricula activities; and to utilise experiences and skills developed after the length of the project to enhance humanities teaching in their schools. Wider benefits for some of the teachers involved in the project includes enhancing continuing professional development and the opportunity to participate in outputs. Anticipated benefits for the students in these schools include: learning that is more social and student centred; cross curricula links that enhance learning and achievement at more than just subject knowledge (about Ancient Greece) including communication, numeracy, problem solving, 3D modelling and information-technology. Four regions of the UK and different types of schools have been chosen to expand the possible impact of the research. Further to this, the mix of independent, Academy and Local Education Authority schools increases the potential for impact within different types of education systems.

The year-long events have been structured such that the outcomes and outputs are disseminated as widely as possible, and cover a combination of online open access websites which will ensure long-term impact of the activities that far exceeds the timeframe of the project itself: 

1. Lesson plans and partner evaluations will be published on TES connect and Guardian Teacher Network and will provide free downloadable resources that will be attractive and of significant value for an international audience of teachers of Classical civilisation, History, Design and Technology, Mathematics and cross-curricular teaching (for example, KS 2 &amp;amp; 3 resources are relevant for 4 and 5 grade and A-level resources will be relevant for 11 &amp;amp; 12 grades in the U.S.A., Years 3-5 and 11-12 in Australia). 
2. Lesson plan and evaluations of the Ancient Greek Storytelling activity using LEGO Education StoryStarter will be uploaded to the LEGO Education Community webpages. The use of LEGO in education is relatively new but it is an international brand and the materials and website have an international audience. Partner teachers have already expressed a desire to use the websites of LEGO and The Historical Association to showcase their school and the activities of their students after the project, ensuring a lasting legacy of the project.
3. An open access article and teaching resources to be researched and written by the PI, based on context for research, interviews held between the PI and the teachers during the project, lesson plans, teacher evaluations of the development process and classroom activities and PI evaluation of the project, will be published on The Classics Library.

The beneficiary third sector organisations are The Classics Library and Classics for all. Anticipated benefits for this group include an edition of The Classics Library journal; a broader range of schools and teachers actively involved in Classics teacher networks; increased geographical spread of involved schools; the opportunity to showcase innovative methods for promoting the study of Classical Civilisation; opportunities for longer term collaboration with the schools and teachers; increased publicity for both organisations through the events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003543/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>34457363-5AFA-40BF-BBA6-71DB708DF181</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Curriculum areas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
