Higher order equations are usually studied via reduction to a first order system, so the analysis of hyperbolic scalar equations can be regarded as analysis of linear hyperbolic systems. There exist two classes of systems: systems without multiplicities (strictly hyperbolic) and systems with multiplicities (weakly hyperbolic). We have a very good understanding of strictly hyperbolic systems but the situation is completely different when multiplicities appear. This project is devoted to hyperbolic systems with multiplicities, a notoriously difficult topic in the field of partial differential equations. The complex nature of this research area is testified by the fragmented results obtained so far and by the numerous open problems.
This project promises to develop a new approach to hyperbolic systems with multiplicities which will solve long-standing open problems in the field.
Note that, the studying of nonlinear systems often starts with a linearisation process, which in the hyperbolic case leads to systems with multiplicties, so the advances in this project will be useful for the research on non-linear hyperbolic equations and systems as well.

In the first part of the project I will concentrate on linear weakly hyperbolic systems with coefficients depending only on time (t-dependent). As a first step I will work out a reduction of the system to a special form: a block Sylvester form (Objective I). This reduction is very important because will allow me to find more easily a suitable energy and to prove well-posedness for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In addition, I will prove that a reduction to block Sylvester form can be done on hyperbolic systems which are not necessarily linear, so Objective I will be relevant for the analysis of nonlinear systems as well. 

After this preliminary part I will pass to consider weakly hyperbolic systems with t-dependent regular coefficients (Objective II). Here regular means smooth or analytic. By using techniques so far employed only for scalar equations and not for systems (quasi-symmetriser) I will prove well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem in every Gevrey class (intermediate classes between analytic functions and smooth functions) or more in general in the space of smooth functions and/or distributions. This will require precise conditions on the lower order terms (Levi conditions) whose optimality still has to be understood. The ultimate challenging goal will be a characterisation of well-posedness at the lower order terms level. 

As a natural Objective III, I will then ask myself what happens when the regularity of the coefficients is sensibly reduced. The existing results always assume at least H&amp;ouml;lder regularity and are formulated in terms of Gevrey well-posedness. It is my intention to drop this regularity restriction. This requires the development of new methodologies and techniques. The main idea is to work on a regularised problem, where the coefficients have been regularised by convolution with a mollifier. Such a regularisation does not change the nature of the system but provides a family of more regular systems (depending on a parameter tending to 0) which can be studied thanks to Objective III. The net of solutions of the regularised problem (generalised solution) will then be analysed asymptotically and eventually lead to a classical solution via limit procedure.

The final part of the project (Objective IV) will be devoted to weakly hyperbolic systems with (t,x)-dependent coefficients and will employ techniques (semigroups) completely different from the ones of the first part. More precisely, Objective IV is the ambitious (t,x)-version of Objective III, aiming to drop regularity assumptions in both t and x.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs arise in basically all sciences (physics, chemistry, medicine, engineering, astronomy, etc). Hence, the results of the proposed research will be of interests for an heterogeneous community of scientists and will have mathematical impact on the following research subjects: PDEs, microlocal analysis, propagation of singularities, global analysis and functional analysis. The potential application of this project to seismology and geophysics (the propagation of waves in a layered medium as the Earth can be studied via a hyperbolic system with singular coefficients and possible multiplicities) have an important social impact as well. Indeed, a better understanding of the internal structure of our planet not only leads to important advances in Science but could help humanity in case of calamities like earthquakes and tsumanis. In the last decade, mathematics, and in particular the theory of hyperbolic equations and microlocal analysis, has been the theoretical base of many researches in geophysics. For instance there is an ongoing collaboration between mathematicians at Perdue University and geophysicists at MIT on propagation of waves in the core-mantle boundary of the Earth, employing techniques from hyperbolic PDEs, microlocal analysis and statistics.
 
The proposed research will have a quite wide range of beneficiaries: from mathematicians (analysts and applied mathematicians) to physicists, geophysicists, engineers, etc. As mentioned in the academic beneficiaries section, the department of Mathematical Sciences at Loughborough University, myself, the PI, and the RA who will be appointed, will benefit hugely of two years of research on hyperbolic systems. This will definitely strengthen the local analysis group and contribute to create a small research group on hyperbolic equations. As pointed out in the international mathematical review, it is very important to strenghen the research in UK in analysis and in particular in PDEs. This project will have a positive impact on this. 

The scientific impact of the proposed research will be enhanced via a well-planned dissemination strategy, based on local seminars and working groups, participation to conferences, collaborations and research visits, workshop organisation and publication in high-raking mathematical journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have treated for the first time hyperbolic systems with multiplicities and highly non-regular coefficients (distributional) by introducing the notion of very weak solution.
