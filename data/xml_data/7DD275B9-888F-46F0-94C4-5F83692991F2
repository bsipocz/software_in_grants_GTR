The monograph will make three main contributions. 
 First it will develop theoretical approaches to the idea of place. Place is one of the most important inter-disciplinary issues of the 21st century. Based on seven years of work in the archives the author will take ideas around place forward into new territory. Traditionally place has been through of a particular location with attached meanings and sentiment. This notion of place focuses on bounded spatial units with deep roots in history and singular forms of identity attached to them. Many have argued that our modern world is one of movement and networks that erodes distinctive places. Ideas of non-place and placelessness have become common. Some have suggested that a better way of thinking about place is as a coming together of flows in and out of a particular location. The purpose of the proposed monograph is to take this thinking forward by using the notion of place as a complicated and location- specific assembling of aspects of material culture (buildings, commodities, waste etc), representations (novels, photographs, plans etc.) and practices (tourism, selling, playing music etc). The first contribution of this project, therefore, will be a theoretical contribution that builds on over 15 years of work on place by Cresswell and will be used across the array of disciplines who engage with place.
 The second contribution will be a creative and engaging account of a particular place, the area around the historic site of the Maxwell Street Market in Chicago, Illinois. Cresswell has been visiting archives and interviewing key actors in the area for the last seven years. The market was once the largest open-air market in North America and the area around it was the most densely populated area in the world in the first decade of the twentieth century. It was a place of constant migration and referred to as the &amp;quot;Ellis Island of the Midwest&amp;quot;. The place is fascinating in itself. The account of one hundred years of the place's history will be divided into three sections on material culture, representation and practice. It will include an account of buildings, market goods (the Zoot Suit and the Hot Dog were both invented here), the accounts of novelists (pulp detective novels, the novels of Willard Motley), the images of photographers (both amateur and professional) and film-makers (it appeared in the Blues Brothers in addition to documentary films), the activities of tourists, stall-holders and musicians (it is said to be the birthplace of the Chicago blues). This will be the first full length account of Maxwell Street
 The third contribution is to heritage studies and the understanding of places of memory. The fourth chapter in the book is an account of the end of Maxwell Street as it was destroyed by an urban village development funded by the University of Illinois, Chicago. A group of market enthusiasts attempted to protect the area from development by having declared an official historic place. This failed because the National Park Service pointed out that there was nothing particularly worth preserving in the material landscape. The activists made a case based on intangible aspects of market and music performance and practice. This chapter develops ideas of intangible heritage and ways in which the non-material might be remembered. This is currently a significant issue being developed by UNESCO and Cresswell will take his ideas to appropriate World Heritage Conventions in order to inform the development of thinking and policy around this issue.
 In addition to time to write the monograph, Cresswell will present this work at two conferences and write two papers for leading journals. He will also spend one last two week period in Chicago which will include a public talk on his work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

Who will benefit from this research and how?

The primary objectives of this project are academic. However, there are a number of potential non-academic beneficiaries.

The clearest impact will be on the Maxwell Street Foundation, the group who sought to preserve what is left of the market since the mid 1990s. They have been directly involved in the research for four years as research subjects and informants. They will benefit from the extra publicity and from the account of strategies for historic preservation. 

Other groups involved in attempts to have urban areas, and particularly historic markets, around the world may benefit from the account of the market and the attempts to have it protected. 

Professionals in the heritage industry, and particularly those interested in intangible heritage, have expressed an interest in my work. This ranges from particular museums right up to UNESCO. They will benefit from ways if thinking about intangible heritage in an urban context. Intangible heritage is normally developed in relation to traditional cultural forms such as folk dance and rituals. This brings this into a modern urban realm. Particular beneficiaries may include English Heritage, UNESCO, the National Park Service (USA) and city government heritage departments in a range of settings. 

The Chicago History Museum has good Maxwell Street archives and I aim to give a public talk at the museum raising awareness of both the museum and the efforts of the Maxwell Street Foundation.

City governments may benefit from thinking about ways to develop market areas as places of memory in order to make economic gain from the possibilities and potential of market spaces.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J003034/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
