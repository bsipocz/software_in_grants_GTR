(low
resolution) personnel localisation system with customers in both the UK and The Netherlands.
This interaction with the market, including extensive discussions with potential customers,
has generated numerous enquiries about developing the ActivCampus solution by adding the
ability to provide accurate (sub-metre) real-time positioning information within the existing
secure, low cost, multi-year lifetime ActivCampus technology framework. Essentially our
business has reached a critical point where the positional accuracy of our current
ActivCampus product (within the coverage range of a wireless reader, a resolution of 5-15 m)
is limiting the range of end-user applications that we can address. Therefore, to give us the
maximum opportunity of market penetration and system uptake, we need a technology which
can provide much higher resolution at a reasonable cost to the customer without losing the
unique security and ease of deployment USPs offered by ActivCampus.
We believe that the further development of our existing active RFID platform will provide
highly accurate monitoring of movement of people within buildings while balancing the cost
to the end user. By unobtrusive we mean that the operation of the system is virtually invisible
to the end user and thus will have no impact on their day-to-day life. This will be achieved
using ultra-miniature, low form factor active RFID tags so that the user is not conscious of
wearing or carrying the device. While our active RFID technology can offer the longevity
required in these applications as demonstrated by our current system, its utility in high
resolution position prediction has yet to be proven. Therefore we propose to fully investigate
and research new algorithms and techniques for highly accurate indoor movement tracking
using active RFID. The &amp;pound;52k 12-month project will require the employment of a suitably
experienced wireless systems engineer who will conduct the research, performing
comprehensive experiments in typical customer premises and developing the necessary
proprietary software algorithms and optimisation to perform high-resolution tracking and to
explicitly quantify the resolution achievable. Our concept is that this innovation will be
realised as an optional software module available for licensing as part of the ActivCampus
system. This would require only minimal changes to the deployed hardware of the existing
system and furthermore would only be possible due to its unique communications and
systems architecture. Addition of this high-resolution functionality will directly improve our
competitiveness, market penetration and subsequent growth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710008</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
