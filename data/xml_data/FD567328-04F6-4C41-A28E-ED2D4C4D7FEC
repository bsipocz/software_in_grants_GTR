In 2007 the government introduced a new 'corporate manslaughter' offence in order to address perceived high levels of public concern and insecurity that result from these cases, but public attitudes in this area have never been empirically tested in detail. This research project will generate reliable information about public attitudes towards work-related fatality cases, and will measure whether there is a public 'lack of confidence' in the law's ability to handle work-related fatality cases, and whether this translates into support for the new offence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A year-long series of interviews will be conducted with a sample of the general public, which will centre on structured discussion of specific work-related fatality cases. The respondents will consider the seriousness of the incidents, as well as issues of responsibility and punishment that might follow on from it. The data that is gathered will inform understandings of the form that the law governing work-related fatality cases should take, as well as illustrating how these cases function as indicators of risk and feelings of insecurity among the general public.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81529</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regulatory myths' and media representations of health and safety : a social safety culture?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>9C7A7434-5FC2-4DC6-AD22-82C186A8CA93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk on wide-ranging grant-related research issues, at national industry association annual conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-939605497.69886352affcfc0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Regulatory myths', manslaughter, and health and safety in the media : the silly and the serious</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>56306011-0136-4679-A90A-FD46AE7655EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research paper delivered to IOSH industry group meeting</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1444487275.03836822affd2ae</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The societal impacts of the research have centred on making a contribution to contemporary and ongoing debates about the nature and role of health and safety regulation. In 2010, the coalition government commissioned a review by Lord Young, looking at the ways in which the public standing of health and safety regulation could be improved. This was prompted by a particular concern about the proliferation of newspaper stories which represent health and safety regulation as a matter of superfluous intervention into the lives of 'ordinary' people.

The findings of the project were submitted in evidence to Lord Young as part of the consultation process underpinning this review, in order to illustrate the nuanced views encountered as part of the project, as well as the importance attached to issues of work-related safety. It was suggested that any 'low public standing' attributable to health and safety regulation must be differentiated from the widespread support for the overarching goals and principles of that system, which is regarded as acting in the public interest. The crucial lesson from this project appears to be that enforcement action in serious cases can provide a path to improving the public standing of the law.

Relatedly, elements of the research findings have been disseminated to other professional bodies within the field of health and safety law, such as the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, and the British Safety Council, largely within the context of wider discussions about public attitudes towards health and safety regulation more generally.

As well as feeding into, and informing, the Government's Young Review, the findings of this project have been disseminated to many individuals and actors within the health and safety sphere. These include: policymakers within governmental bodies and regulators such as HSE; members and policymakers within industry associations and professional bodies such as IOSH; representatives of business and industry from specific companies and collective organisations; and members of other interest groups.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0931E37-C66C-44A2-AFE5-9CDA750D65DB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>542958e0c75da9.61240045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Normative public attitudes regarding work-related fatality cases.

The investigation found that the public regards work-related fatality cases as serious and significant events. All six of the sample cases discussed received mean seriousness ratings (on 1-11 Likert scale) from 8.21-9.96, illustrating the significance attached to these incidents. This seriousness reflected the physical harmfulness of the incident (those featuring multiple victims were regarded as more serious), but was most closely linked to the qualitative character of the incident (underlying culpability, advertence, vulnerable victim). Seriousness was closely tied to the identification of individual liability (a blameworthy person, rather than a system failure); as such, concepts of motive are important in determining the seriousness of the offence and degree of punitiveness expressed.

Additionally, there was evidence to suggest the public were not expressly punitive in outlook, preferring to frame issues of punishment in terms of preventative, restorative and constructive outcomes rather than explicitly retributive or vengeful ones. Punishment is utilised as a means of fulfilling the goal of accountability, rather than as an end in itself, and this tension is reflected in the ambivalent attitudes expressed in relation to punishing the individual involved (difficulty in reconciling attitudes re: corporate defendants with those held in relation to other areas of criminal justice).

2. Public opinion regarding the substantive law on work-related fatality cases.

The principal substantive findings were that there was some public dissatisfaction with the legal outcomes in relation to work-related fatality cases; public preferences were generally for more significant (larger fines, longer terms of imprisonment, more widespread prosecution) legal responses than were achieved under the existing framework of offences. Crucially, there was a perception that the law was unable to target enforcement in such a way as to achieve the desired outcomes of prevention and deterrence. Incidents tended to be readily categorised as crimes, and to prompt calls for a 'criminal response' when they were able to recognise a specific (individual) locus of negligent action and identifiable advertence, highlighting the perceived moral character of these offences. There was no great support for the imposition of manslaughter liability in particular, and criminal sanctions were primarily seen as appropriate in relation to individual managers/directors rather than corporate bodies. 

3. The impact of work-related fatality cases on public risk perceptions.

 Public attitudes towards the risks that underpin work-related fatality cases were heavily anchored in the personal experiences and heuristic frames of reference possessed by the individual respondents. Respondents used their own lives as a way of interpreting the salience of the risks involved and determining appropriate responses. While the cases were widely viewed as significant, there were significant differences in the ways in which respondents interpreted them as signals of risks that they themselves might face. Lastly, the cases were influential in determining expressed attitudes towards risk regulation and issues of health and safety more generally.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To inform future reform and evaluation of enforcement practices in this area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E272C7C-5335-4E8E-B169-A4B6804646FB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5429587be03f48.97052346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DAB278A7-0FBB-4517-B30E-148572A939E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Communication and Social Regulation: The Criminalization of Work-Related Death</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Criminology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad10ebac8cd736953baa2b786fdfc0b6"><gtr:id>ad10ebac8cd736953baa2b786fdfc0b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Almond P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9ef9ec847055</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2649B15D-6E46-404E-88D6-AF116978DF59</gtr:id><gtr:title>Corporate manslaughter and the culture of control</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/16aa1f541a64984d4a93ace48f9e9b63"><gtr:id>16aa1f541a64984d4a93ace48f9e9b63</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paul Almond (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_4310910927cb3ea630</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB87C177-9A92-429A-9BDC-1C74BF0BF5D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mediating Punitiveness: Understanding Public Attitudes towards Work-Related Fatality Cases</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Criminology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad10ebac8cd736953baa2b786fdfc0b6"><gtr:id>ad10ebac8cd736953baa2b786fdfc0b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Almond P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfaafaae92ca47</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G01017X/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3080</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
