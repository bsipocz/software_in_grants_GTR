A &amp;quot;Smart&amp;quot; home, is one in which each appliance (thing) is not only controllable but is also &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot;, ie. tailored to our individual needs. 
 
Yet, smart objects and smart homes often consider the individual as a passive entity to be 'served', rather than an empowered individual who can make smart decisions based on information. This is often because of the assumption that human cognition isn't able to take on the massive amount of information that could be generated from such smart objects. Indeed, very little is known about how people interact with data and how much of the data which we generate can actually inform our day-to-day decision making. We also do not know whether data generated within a home can change our consumption habits and behaviour. Finally, we are uncertain about whether and to what extent the data that we produce influences other decision makers in our household. Our project offers a new approach to answering these questions by observing actual household behaviour &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot; and developing a personal resource planning system (PRP) to support decisions made by individuals, ie. a smart 'me'. 
 
Our approach is different from existing IoT research in the following ways. First, while traditional research views the customer, who either accepts or rejects the product/service developed by businesses, to be outside the supply system, our approach offers a new perspective in which the customer is also viewed as an inside component of the supply system. This means that the customer, through his/her behaviour, becomes an inherent component of the supply system, and thereby transforms this system into a collaborative exchange system. This collaborative exchange system allows customers to interact with businesses and make decisions about how much customisation they would like to see in each product/service they themselves consume (e.g., Crowcroft et al., 2011; McAuley et al., 2011; Ng. et al., 2013). Second, since our approach has a person (customer) in the centre, the main focus of this project is to understand how &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; things interact with human behaviour, and possibly how this behaviour can be informed by the new data from &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; things to catalyse the appearance of a more informed &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; consumer (e.g., Ng, 2012). Finally, our third contribution to existing research is to create data architecture through the IoT which would allow customers to make more informed &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; decisions. In a way, the main output of this project will be a proof of concept that customers could be &amp;quot;nudged&amp;quot; into making &amp;quot;smarter&amp;quot; consumption decisions which would optimise business-customer interactions and create more value for each household.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have multiple beneficiaries including: (1) consumers; (2) policy makers; (3) private sector; (4) cross-disciplinary scientific community. 
 
(1) Consumers: Proposed project will suggest ways to improve mechanisms used by households to incorporate self-generated data into resources for consumer choices through the PRP system. This would allow households to make &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; (more optimal) consumption decisions which would increase their quality of life. We will work with our partner, Birmingham City Council to educate consumers and generate impact &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot; within the region of West Midlands. In addition to consumers participating in our research project directly, we will also seek to provide educational feedback to the general public. 
 
(2) Policy-makers: Proposed research will offer new ways in which consumers can use their IoT data and make useful policy recommendations as to how the interactions between consumers and their self-generated data could be regulated and supported by the public sector. 
 
(3) Private sector: Our project will provide a practical tool in the form of a ready-to-use PRP system which would propose ways of anticipating future consumer needs/wants. Product and service providers will be able to use this tool to increase consumer satisfaction. This, in turn, will increase business profitability through offering better value for money. 
 
(4) Scientific community: Proposed research will contribute to all disciplines involved in the project by offering new knowledge such as an understanding of interactions between consumers and data; consumption patterns within households and how these patterns depend on the IoT data. 
 
Our impact strategy includes: 
 
(1) Consumer involvement and education: Our project will directly test the new PRP system &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot; with 20 households. We will also conduct surveys and decision-making experiments with consumers. All participants will receive educational feedback after each study. As a result, consumers will be informed about how to make &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; decisions and use self-generated IoT data more effectively. Outreach to general public and wider society will be accomplished through working with the press offices at WMG as well as via the use of social media. 
 
(2) Policy-makers: We will involve policy makers (particularly, Birmingham City Council) in PRP discussions through regular meetings. Online and printed publicity materials will be designed to attract attention to the issues related to the project. Papers produced by the team will suggest policy implications of our results. 
 
(3) Private sector: We will use WMG's existing capacity and connections to design meaningful PRP tests and anticipate demand predictions. We will also leverage on the ongoing RCUK HAT project by involving its stakeholders in our research and providing them with educational feedback. 
 
(4) Scientific community: Our project will generate scientific impact through talks at conferences and workshops. Researchers involved in the project (especially at the postdoctoral level) will gain valuable cross-disciplinary experience in working with a diverse group of researchers. Scientific outreach will also work through an established IoT Special Interest Group (based in Warwick University) by gathering cross-disciplinary scientists and providing a regular forum for discussion; monthly think-tank meetings initiated in WMG and aimed at attracting a diverse group of students and researchers. By working closely with the RCUK HAT project, we will benefit from HAT team networks and extended partnerships with other interdisciplinary groups funded under the current RCUK Digital Economy initiative.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>385272</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HARRIET Blog/website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E5FB4DB-3416-4207-9135-9BC2707AA812</gtr:id><gtr:impact>he HARRIET blogsite was set up as a channel to communicate with researchers, policymakers and industry practitioners as well as the general public on issues relating to the project, i.e. Smart Cities, Smart Citizens and Smart Things.

The theme of SSFV2016 was Smart Service Systems &amp;amp; Business Models in the Digital Era. Held in Venice from June 12-13, 2016, the conference aimed to provide opportunities for service researchers from academia and practitioners from industry to share the latest research and practice on topics related to smart service systems and business models in the digital economy. 





 It also featured a Practitioners' Forum, a half-day session with key practitioners to discuss integration of knowledge to inform practice. HAT Project Lead Irene Ng presented a Keynote Address on Personal Data as an Amplification of Human Capability on the HAT. The event saw the participation of 20 service researchers and industry practitioners who engaged in interesting discussions about the personal data economy and their role in it. The success of SSF2015 has inspired the organisation of the 2nd Service Systems Forum in June 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7eb0a9cbce6.26426986</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/business_transformation/ssg/ssgabout/sswmgactivities/ssfv2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Competitive Advantage in the Digital Economy (CADE) 2016: Markets, Currencies and Data (Venice, Italy)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA09E998-6396-407A-9099-5C8842C294B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CADE 2016 expanded its reach from last year's event, with participants coming from a range of European countries and in total, 20+ institutions were represented at the school.

Participants were also able to apply their existing knowledge base and everything that they had learnt during the school to the CADE challenge; to use a range of potential data sources (e.g., facebook, calendar, location, health) to come up with the killer app for the HAT (Hub-of-all-Things).

This year the topic of the School was: &amp;quot;Personal Data Economy and New Business Models&amp;quot;. Thought leaders from a variety of sciences including Marketing, Service Systems, Computer Science, Economics, and Business Administration shared their opinions about the impact of technology on the way businesses operate, with particular reference to personal data economy and connected data. 

In recent years, urban areas have seen a rapid growth in the Big Personal Data generation at the individual citizen, community, and city levels. This, in turn, has led to the increase in demand for new pricing mechanisms governing the exchange of Big Personal Data. 

 As a part of CADE 2015, HARRIET also organised a city challenge for early career researchers. This challenge was to deliver a (digital) solution with the relevant business model for a specific city. The city of Venice (Italy) wanted to increase tourist mobility, the city of Murcia (Spain) looked for ways to make use of its newly built but troubled airport, and the town of Catia La Mar (Venezuela) looked for way to establish a new art museum. Three teams competed in this year's challenge with each team working on solutions for Venice, Murcia, and Catia, respectively. Teams presented their solutions which were judged by the professional committee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9bc58d2e011.75984378</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hubofallthings.com/Harriet/2015/06/personal-data-economy-drives-the-agenda-at-the-cade-2015-summer-school/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants</gtr:department><gtr:description>Smart City and Smart Citizens: New Business and Economic Models of Urban Living</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The British Academy</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7BE0079A-5112-4C25-AB6D-62D7C160F258</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a9c4a72848.44979826</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Warwick University Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Smart Cities: Citizens' Wellbeing &amp;amp; Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Warwick</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A36E11E2-CC24-431A-A8F0-AA41A43812BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a53c595ae9.48293295</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research project's findings and development of Rumpel is being taken forward by the HAT Foundation, a social enterprise grouping spun off from the HAT project. The HAT Foundation is led by a management team comprising academics and researchers who worked on the HAT project, including HAT &amp;amp; HARRIET Project PI Irene Ng and Paul Tasker, who was independent chair of the HAT Industrial Advisory Board. It consists of the HAT Community Foundation, a charity body and its operational arm HAT Data Exchange Ltd (HATDeX) which has developed the Alpha HAT into its beta version of the HAT. 

Rumpel together with the HAT was released to 136 beta users in July 2016. Further development of the Rumpel hyperdata browser has included Rumpel Modules such as Notables, which enables users to log private notes, lists, blogs, links and share them on the Internet on their own terms. HATDeX has also developed Rumpel Lite, the mobile extension of web Rumpel that is compatible with iOS phones. Plans are under way to have Rumpel include automated and personalised suggestions, prompts and reminders based on users' needs, habits and lifestyles - for example, prioritising news-feed items based on your interests, or helping to inform decisions about what concert or movie to see taking into account where exactly you are and what you have enjoyed previously.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F4827D1C-F41C-46CB-B029-425311E04392</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e144af809a06.15847665</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The HARRIET project has developed and released Rumpel, a ground-breaking hyperdata web browser that makes it simpler for people to access and use online data about themselves. The first of its kind, Rumpel is a dashboard that makes it easy for its users to visualise, understand and organise all kinds of personal data, much of which has been hard to access in the past. Rumpel gives users the ability to browse their very own private and secure 'personal data wardrobe' - the HAT (Hub-of-all-Things) which collates data about them held on the internet and allows them to control, combine and share it in whatever way they wish. The HAT was developed on the RCUK-funded project Home Hub-of-all-Things (HAT) as Platform for Multi-sided Market powered by Internet-of-Things: Opportunities for New Economic &amp;amp; Business Model (EP/K039911/1). Through Rumpel, which is also a personal resource planning tool for individuals, HARRIET will assist individuals to better understand their household consumption behaviour and make 'smarter' decisions to plan and live better lives based on their own data stored on the HAT. 

HARRIET has also made an impact in implementing smart solutions in cities, establishing collaborations with the City of Birmingham and engaginged in discussions with policy makers from Coventry, Hamburg, Tolouse, Lappeenranta, and Istanbul. Smart cities are urban regions seeking to utilise innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) in architectural planning and design, creative and cultural industries, and concepts of social and environmental sustainability, in order to address economic, spatial, social and ecological problems facing cities today. On a daily basis, smart cities accumulate large masses of data from a variety of sources such as transportation, network, energy sector, smart homes, tax records, surveys, Light Detection and Ranging sensor data (LiDAR), mobile phones sensors, etc. The data from these various sources is then accumulated, linked, and connected via the Internet of Things (IoT).

With the development of computers and smartphones, citizens' interactions with firms are becoming more connected affecting other firms and public bodies in urban living. As a result, firms change the way they design and configure future products and services. Therefore, new business models, i.e., how firms &amp;quot;do business&amp;quot; through their value propositions, value creation and value capture, will play a key role in shaping smart cities of the future. Yet, very little is known about new business models within smart cities and urban living and how these models can be supported by the urban data.

How can cities use, understand, and most importantly, analyse data generated by citizens, businesses, and municipalities to ensure more optimal fulfilment of citizens' wants and needs, to reach sustainable and green society, and to ensure economic growth? Recent advances in Big Data and Connected Data analytics provide useful insights into how city data can be analysed and then used to generate value for municipalities, companies, and individuals offering a variety of tools which range from relatively simple data mining and clustering algorithms to more sophisticated analytics which takes into account the context in which individuals are making decisions in cities.

One of the major challenges for analysing urban datasets is data volume. Recent estimates show that by the end of 2017, annual global traffic of data will reach 7.7 Zettabytes. Under these conditions, it is not clear how analytics will be able to cope with such a volume. This challenge is of grave importance for many municipalities and organisations thatwhich are often forced to delete large quantities of potentially valuable information. Among other sources, customer loyalty card information, video data from security cameras, etc. - all this data is barely used for analytics and often deleted within weeks if not days after collection. Yet, clustering models for large datasets offer some hope for solving this problem.

The idea behind clustering urban data is to split it into similar (homogeneous) groups in accordance with specific attributes. Clustering large masses of urban data in a compact format allows analysts to present information of the entire dataset (without omissions or deletions) but reorganises the data and makes it manageable.

The HARRIET project recently tested two clustering techniques appropriate for large urban datasets: the K-Means technique and the Fuzzy c-Mean (FCM) technique. K-Means divides the data into clusters by minimising the distance between data points and the &amp;quot;centroid&amp;quot; of the cluster (usually calculated as a mean of all points in the cluster). FCM is similar to K-Means but assumes that it is possible that an object/data point may belong to more than one cluster according to its degree of membership. We used LiDAR sensor data from the area of the University of Warwick in Coventry (UK) to compare the performance of K-Means vs FCM. Clustering was conducted on a rather standard AMD 8320, 4.1 GHz, 8 core processor with 8 GB of RAM and running a 64-bit Windows 8.1 OS. As a result of this test, we found that FCM clustering works faster on larger datasets than K-Means. However, K-Means requires less processing power than FCM.

This means that clustering techniques can be very helpful in dealing with large masses of urban data. In fact, clustering cluster analysis for smart data empowers smart cities to conduct 'smart' analytics (analytics which does not require omitting or deleting valuable information) on data generated by citizens, firms, and cities themselves in order to create an optimal system which would allow citizens' wants and needs to be accurately anticipated as well as help firms and cities to develop and deliver anticipated goods and services to citizens.

The time and further tests will tell which clustering technique is best. Based on some early tests, if you have significant limitations to your processing power, K-Means clustering is a good solution but be prepared to wait for the results. If processing power is not a big issue, FCM will work better for large urban datasets and provide a faster solution.

In recent years, urban areas have seen a rapid growth in the Big Personal Data generation at the individual citizen, community, and city levels. This, in turn, has led to the increase in demand for new pricing mechanisms governing the exchange of Big Personal Data. HARRIET produced a paper entitled Multi-Sided Markets and Pricing for Big Personal Data: Smarter Cities and Citizens (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281063774_Multi-Sided_Markets_and_Pricing_for_Big_Personal_Data_Smarter_Cities_and_Citizens?channel=doi&amp;amp;linkId=55d3170708ae7fb244f57dff&amp;amp;showFulltext=true) which was framed in the context of how new data platforms, banks, and pricing mechanisms can benefit the stakeholders. In particular, we examine how emerging data platforms (that can enable data-driven business models and evaluate both existing and user-centric pricing mechanisms) can be combined with multi-sided markets. A case study involving commodity sensors, personal data, and consumer behaviour is showcased to illustrate the concepts in action.

These and many other results were discussed with practitioners and policy makers at the Smart Cities Forum (http://hubofallthings.com/Harriet/scf/) and Competitive Advantage in Global Economy summer school 2015 (http://hubofallthings.com/Harriet/2015/06/personal-data-economy-drives-the-agenda-at-the-cade-2015-summer-school/).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Released to the public in July 2016, Rumpel is compatible with all computer Operating Systems and is made available as an open source programme, which means other developers can contribute to its development and freely use it to create their own versions of the hyperdata browser. 

With regards to the research on smart cities, city solutions can be adopted from the relevant research outputs (papers) to be directly implemented in interested cities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8ACF59A3-28B6-4EFF-A031-E39D1511FD35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e14487b032b6.23688791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://hubofallthings.com/Harriet</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset was used in research output:

We propose a broad framework for individual choice under risk which can accommodate many stochastic formulations of various deterministic theories. Using this framework to guide an experimental design, we show that most individuals' departures from the independence axiom cannot be explained by adding a 'random noise' term to a deterministic 'core' theory which incorporates this axiom. We also find behaviour that cannot be explained in terms of the standard assumptions of Cumulative Prospect Theory, often invoked to account for violations of independence. Our results suggest that 'similarity' effects may explain the data better.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7dd0bea0933.15871867</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Individual Common Ratio Preference Reversals Dataset</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gannapogrebna.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2014-JRU-RAW.xlsx</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset was used in research output:

There is widespread interest in measuring risk attitudes and incorporating such 
measures into broader econometric analyses. We consider three elicitation procedures currently in use. We find considerable variability within - and even more, between - the results they produce. We suggest that this reflects the way that different instruments interact with imprecise underlying preferences. The short run implication is that such procedures need to be used with caution and are likely to be highly context-specific. The longer run implication is that adding 'white noise' to deterministic models is inadequate: we need to develop models that allow for imprecision and procedural variation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d9dc843c82.39493442</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Individual Risk Attitudes Dataset</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gannapogrebna.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RAW-DATA.xlsx</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The HAT HyperData Browser is a - 'browser' of how data is linked to other data in other places and a way to view the linkages and clusters of data.
