In fact, censorship left such a deep imprint on Spain's collective memory that it is often regarded as the best illustration of the lack of basic freedoms during Franco's rule. This is why until now scholars have drawn a firm line between censorship and non-censorship, equating the authoritarian regime with the purging of books and democracy with freedom of expression. Several underlying consequences follow from this premise: firstly, it limits the understanding of this practice and its effects to a specific historical period (1939-1976); secondly, it implies that censorship was exclusively imposed by the government's legal mechanisms; thirdly, it suggests that writers and publishers were engaged in an uneven struggle with the regime in which little could be gained other than trying to minimise the impact of prohibitive policies on their work. The main aim of this project is to challenge these widely accepted assumptions and explore the mechanisms by which cultures interact by focusing on the changing function of a number of texts rendered from English and published in both Franco's and democratic Spain.\n\nA case in point is Ian Fleming's Dr No, a revealing example of how the position of translations in the literary system is determined by a myriad of economic, cultural and social factors. As will be demonstrated, attempts to publish the novel were met with fierce opposition by the Spanish censors, who considered that it subverted the dominant values of the host culture and for this reason forced substantial cuts upon the editor. The effects of censorship on this text, however, did not end with the regime's demise, since two expurgated versions of Dr No were reprinted in the early 2000s and are still available in bookshops. The analysis of a number of canonical works such as Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, Allan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, John Dos Passos's Parallel 42 and Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie will make apparent that Fleming's novel is by no means an exception. This project will also examine the translation and censoring of political and philosophical works, an area which has been neglected by scholars. In order to fill this important void, one chapter of the monograph will be devoted to exploring the reception of Bertrand Russell's oeuvre. The analysis of the context under which the above texts were published and the translators's choices and strategies will shed light on both the textual representation of the cultural other in Franco's Spain and the fundamental importance of foreign cultural paradigms in the post-war literary field.\n\nBy examining the censorship records kept at the Archivo General de la Administraci&amp;oacute;n (Alcal&amp;aacute; de Henares), comparing different renditions of the same text and analysing the context of production of a number of case studies representing different genres, this project sets out to explore the role of the censor, the publisher and the translator in the configuration of meaning and thereby to understand their role in mediating the reading process. In broad terms, the main goal of this research is twofold: on the one hand, to demonstrate the key role of translation in the Spanish cultural recovery of the 1960s; on the other, to prove that the importance of examining the impact of censorship on the Spanish publishing sector extends well beyond Franco's dictatorship, since this practice is still impinging on current cultural policies. The controversial premise of this project is that, since publishers have continued to offer excised translations to the public, censorship still plays an important function in cultural life and thereforecannot be considered a mere historical episode that has little or no relevance to the present.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>IMPACT SUMMARY\n\nThe evidence that the results of earlier phases of this project have been reported by the media (see Pathways to Impact) suggests that this current proposal has the potential to reach a wide non-specialist audience. Non-academic beneficiaries can be divided into four interrelated groups:\n\n1. The Spanish and Catalan cultural sector: The revelation that a significant percentage of the translations reedited from 1976 onwards bear the marks of censorship is likely to have an impact on the cultural domain as a whole, from critics to translators and publishers. Of particular importance to this sector will be the discussion of the ethical and even legal implications of publishing censored texts, which violates the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and therefore constitutes an infringement of copyright. From time to time, full versions of censored manuscripts have been published, but these are isolated cases and consequently do not follow regular patterns. The systematic analysis of the different (and sometimes contradictory) strategies that have been employed thus far (chapter 6), however, will enable the creation of clear guidelines on how to proceed with regard to the republication of texts produced under Franco's regime. This research, therefore, will help change the practices of the publishing sector by encouraging publishers to review their catalogues and find suitable strategies to deal with pre-democratic editions.\n\n2. Governmental bodies concerned with the promotion and preservation of Spanish cultural heritage, particularly the Subdirecci&amp;oacute;n General de Coordinaci&amp;oacute;n Bibliotecaria and the Sistema Espa&amp;ntilde;ol de Bibliotecas, and organizations committed to the recovery of the historical memory of the Spanish Civil War and the post-war period such as the Centro Documental de la Memoria Hist&amp;oacute;rica. Since several of the project's foci overlap with the goals of these institutions, before the start of the Fellowship I wistablish contact with several bodies in order to identify synergies and build a collaborative relationship. Among the initiatives to be discussed are the display of censored works and the production of informative material on the subject to be distributed in public libraries. In order to ensure that activities have an effective impact and benefit large segments of the population, proposals for collaboration will be disseminated through institutional networks.\n\n3. Translators: In addition to discussing a range of practical problems similar to those faced by translators in the practice of their profession, the monograph will address the ethical implications of publishing and distributing censored books without the translator's consent. This study is likely to bring to light a number of cases in which the author's and the translator's rights, protected by the WIPO Copyright Treaty, have been violated, and the solutions provided to restore censored texts will require the involvement of the translator's profession.\n\n4. The general public: One of the most heated and polarized debates of contemporary Spain revolves around the ways in which the legacy of Franco's dictatorship should be confronted. As a consequence of the controversial Historical Memory Law (2007), several public monuments and plaques have been destroyed or dismantled in the last few years. These kinds of drastic actions pose the question of what to do with other kinds of cultural artefacts such as books. If this question has not yet been asked, it is because this recent debate is still in a preliminary stage, but once the debate is set in motion this issue is likely to take centre stage. This project, therefore, is particularly timely, since it will ignite a discussion which has implications stretching well beyond academia and is of interest to large segments of the population.

During the course of my research I discovered that Spanish publishers are still re-editing books which still bear cuts imposed by censors under Franco's Dictatorship (1939-1975). Many of the published translations of the classics of English and American literature currently available in Spain, therefore, are still the edited versions approved by the censors. As a result of the impact of my research, both the reading public and the publishing sector are now more aware of the long-lasting effects of Franco's censorship.



'Translating and Censoring Cultural Difference in Franco's Spain' is structured around four main innovative and challenging ideas which so far have received no attention from scholars:



1. Censored books are still being published. Up until know scholars have assumed that censorship was implemented in 1938 and was abolished by the new democratic constitution in 1978. In the course of my research, however, I unexpectedly discovered that many expurgated books have been published again in democracy with the cuts enforced by the censor. In Spain, therefore, censorship is not a thing of the past, a mere historical episode with little relevance to the present. On the contrary, the impact of this practice extends well beyond Franco's regime and still plays an important role in Spanish cultural life. Publishing expurgated books is an ethically dubious practice because is disrespectful towards the reader and the author. In addition, it is problematic from a legal point of view because it may infringe the rights of the copyright holder, since publishers and translators do not have the right to distort or mutilate original works. My goal is to raise awareness of the long-lasting effects of Francoist repressive policies and promote a debate around this issue so that readers, translators and publishing sector are aware of the problem and can devise strategies to address this unresolved issue. Overall, after the regime's downfall, expurgated works have been subjected to four different strategies: a) some have never been republished, b) many have been reprinted without any modification, c) some have undergone a thematic and/or linguistic revision, and d) many have been retranslated.



2. The importance of Latin American translations in the Spanish post-war literary field. It has never been observed before that in the 1940 Spain was flooded with Latin American translations, mainly because the country suffered a trade embargo which caused a scarcity of printing materials. In addition, many relevant authors, such as Aldous Huxley, refused to be translated in Spain because they knew very well that their work would be censored. For the Spanish reading public these Latin American translations were of course a blessing, but some intellectuals resented the fact that the most vibrant and dynamic publishing companies were no longer in Madrid or Barcelona, but in Buenos Aires, Mexico or Bogota. Latin American publishing houses, therefore, seriously challenged the cultural supremacy of Spain in the Hispanic world, and the response of some intellectuals to this threat was to launch a campaign against Latin American translators, who were accused of corrupting the Spanish language. Criticism was so widespread that in the 1950s many Spanish publishing houses started to translate Argentinian and Mexican translations into Castilian Spanish.



3. The importance of the illegal book trade during Franco's regime. This is an enormously important phenomenon which so far has never been addressed by scholars. I have gathered evidence which clearly demonstrates that, since the mid-1940s, hundreds of thousands of books were imported illegally into Spain, most of them from Latin America, but also from France and even China. Readers, well aware of the fact that because of censorship many books could not be distributed, were more than willing to pay high prices for books that were popular in the Western world but remained unavailable at home. Since demand was high, profits were to be made, and a vast network of importers, distributors and booksellers made sure that potential customers had easy access to prohibited materials. This part of my research is mostly based on oral sources, because due to the illegal nature of this trade very little factual data is available.



4. The previous points show that the concept and effects of censorship on post-war Spanish society should be rethought. For all the emphasis scholars put on censorship, the reality is that banned books circulated in large quantities, and my research indicates that the illegal book trade was tolerated by the regime - within certain limits. This is not to say that the effects of censorship were irrelevant, but that post-war culture cannot be properly understood without taking into account the strategies to counteract or bypass official regulations.



The literature devoted to Franco's dictatorship, in order to stress the opposition between past authoritarian policies and current ones, has created and reinforced the figure of the evil censor, an intellectual other against which contemporary scholars and publishing houses can define themselves, becoming in this way the custodians of freedom of expression, tolerance and respect for the reader. My research, however, demonstrates that this is in part an ideological fantasy that turns its back to post-Franco publishing practices, disregards the long-term influence of cultural products and, ultimately, refuses to examine the real complexities of Spain's transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. All in all, the inconsistent way in which expurgated books have been treated is more than just a metaphor for the country's difficulties to face the legacy of Franco's regime, it is a tangible proof of the lack of reflection on the country's cultural heritage.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a result of the impact of my research, both the reading public and the publishing sector are now more aware of the long-lasting effects of Franco's censorship. The article published in Ara, for instance, shows that publishers are implementing new strategies with regard to the presence of censored works in their catalogues, and the public lectures I gave in Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona have helped raise awareness of this issue among the public, translators and the cultural establishment. In two forthcoming articles I argue that the solution to this problem is to give more visibility to the long-term effects of the regime's repressive cultural policies so that readers and the publishing sector are aware of the ways in which censorship has reproduced itself over the years ('The Afterlife of Francoist Cultural Policies: Censorship and Translation in the Catalan and Spanish Literary Market' (2013, Hispanic Research Journal) and 'La censura despr&amp;eacute;s dels censors: algunes reflexions sobre aspectes no resolts de l'her&amp;egrave;ncia cultural del franquisme' (2013, Trilcat).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5608802C-5A3B-4824-BCC9-C3F1AA0423C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3442041607.05398947763265a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://jordi-cornella.blogspot.com.es/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>015A4F35-59D5-4F42-834B-CDB83CB71955</gtr:id><gtr:title>La obra de James Baldwin ante la censura franquista: el contrabando de libros, la conexi&amp;oacute;n latinoamericana y la evoluci&amp;oacute;n del sector editorial peninsular</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Represura</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/490d080a1b34909924377b98aa14428c"><gtr:id>490d080a1b34909924377b98aa14428c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jordi Cornell?-Detrell</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544a737eca0552.13474776</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E1B535F-ABB8-4C53-89AE-D10671DDE76B</gtr:id><gtr:title>La censura despr&amp;eacute;s dels censors: algunes reflexions sobre aspectes no resolts de l'her&amp;egrave;ncia cultural del franquisme</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Anuari Trilcat</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/490d080a1b34909924377b98aa14428c"><gtr:id>490d080a1b34909924377b98aa14428c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jordi Cornell?-Detrell</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_605104069164104722</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>21376B6F-9AAE-4CA6-82F7-E3959AAAB347</gtr:id><gtr:title>L'auge de la traducci&amp;oacute;
