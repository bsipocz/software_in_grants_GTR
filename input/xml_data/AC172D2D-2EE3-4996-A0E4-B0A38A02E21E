There are few instances of engineering feats being reported at the national level to inspire the next generation and there can be a negative perception of the engineer as someone who traditionally does manual work. This completely ignores the tremendous advances that have taken place in modern engineering research but increasing the visibility of the latter, and presenting it in an accessible manner, to the general public has been a long standing problem. This project aims to counter the apathy, and in some cases, the negativity of engineering through providing examples of how recent advances in the field have contributed to the greater good of society. There is, however, a critical issue. Appreciating the need for a message and preparing the content is laudable, but delivering it effectively to someone willing to listen presents a whole set of additional problems. This project seeks to take a covert route by exploiting a well known tale (Gulliver's Travels) as the foundation upon which to build a children's fable which is complementary to the original but which is, at the same time, unique and within which is embedded the message that engineering is an exciting, dynamic field that has many benefits. In essence, the tale aims to provide a narrative that re-invents the engineer, and engineering as a whole, and present them as the hero of the story by delivering the message in a form that captures the imagination and curiosity of the reader such that they want to engage with the story. The project takes the existing research being conducted at Ulster and adapts the underpinning concepts such that they can be integrated directly as a plot device within the storyline. Central to the programme is the involvement of pupils to help illustrate the tale who can then become stakeholders in the preparation of a booklet that would be disseminated throughout Northern Ireland - through schools and visitor attractions and libraries/exhibition centres. The project encompasses an interdisciplinary team: material scientists, engineers, a writer, an artist, educationalists and those directly engaged with the public - all of whom combine to deliver a framework that would, in the first instance raise the profile of engineering in the short term but, more meaningfully, could provide a mechanism for more long lasting retention. In addition, the system is inherently versatile in terms of storyline, that other tale variants could be harnessed to increase public recognition and thereby exploit local / topical scenarios within which to capture the interest of the general public. In essence the project will deliver a strategy that could be readily transferable to other sub disciplines of engineering and, indeed, to other branches of science and technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has clear potential to engage pupils and public alike and provides a novelty that will also stimulate the researchers to contribute their thoughts in a more accessible form. It would strengthen the public engagement ethos and can easily be transferable to other units of activity. Most importantly, it provides an accessible vehicle for reaching an audience that would otherwise see no reason to engage with the normal workings and output of an engineering unit. The booklet takes the information to the public and has the ability to conjure a positive picture that could easily, albeit covertly, enhance the perception of the profession. The project thus 1. Emphasizes the need for engagement to a hitherto reluctant academic cohort 2. Builds capacity for future engagement activities 3. Provides a versatile and transferable engagement vehicle that not only reaches a wide audience but one which is actively retained. 4. Reaches an apathetic/disaffected audience 5. Stimulates participation and engagement with the programme 6. Exploits curiosity as a means of capturing interest - across demographics and within the wider media 7. Opens an avenues for investigating and exploiting longer term memory retention 8. Ultimately offers a more positive outlook on the nature engineering and the esteem with which the profession is regarded. The project has the capacity for having a direct and lasting impact on academics, postgraduates, school pupils and their families but also the general public. These constitute the beneficiaries - all of which combine to have a positive impact on society at the local and national level. he capacity for having a direct and lasting impact on academics, postgraduates, school pupils and their families but also the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
