Other benefits include the opportunity for HIV testing and linking people with HIV to health care. 

There are problems with the approach including high costs, difficulties with finding household members and differences in the number of people with TB found. 

Primary health care is currently being reorganised in South Africa. The new approach includes local outreach teams that deliver home and community based health services. Household contract tracing could be combined into these new teams.

Our project uses different research methods to develop, implement and evaluate a combined model of household contact tracing, potentially using the new outreach teams. 

In Phase I we aim to understand more about the local outreach teams, and find out ways to help implement a new combined model household contact tracing. In Phase II, the new model will be implemented in three different districts in South Africa. In Phase III we will analyse our data to see if the new combined model is practicable, and can it find other household members with TB and allow an opportunity to test people for HIV and link people with HIV to health care. We will also collect costs of the new model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Household contact tracing (HHCT) for tuberculosis (TB) is a well-established method for detecting cases earlier and preventing further transmission. Other benefits include the opportunity for HIV testing and linkage to HIV care. HHCT has been included as a priority intervention for the 2015 South African Global Fund application (expected to start April 2016). 

Past experiences with HHCT have highlighted high costs, difficulties with finding contacts and varied yield of TB in a routine setting. Alternative approaches that increase yield or reduce costs may be needed to increase feasibility and impact of this intervention. In South Africa, an important question is to what exten t should contact tracing activities stay exclusively within vertical TB programmes or be integrated into broader, community-based models of care? The primary health care (PHC) reengineering strategy for South Africa incorporates ward-based PHC outreach teams that deliver home &amp;amp; community based health services. TB contact tracing would seem to be particularly well suited to be integrated into this platform. 

In this mixed-methods project, we aim to develop, implement and evaluate an integrated model of HHCT, potentially using the ward-based PHC outreach teams. In Phase I, we will use quantitative and qualitative research techniques to understand the context of ward-based teams, and explore barriers and facilitators to implementation of an integrated model for HHCT. A new model for HHCT will be defined, ideally integrated with the horizontal community-based health services. In Phase II, the new model will be implemented together with a data management system, to allow for monitoring and evaluation of the model. In Phase III, the model implemented and data collected in phase II will be analysed to answer the following questions:
? Is the integrated model feasible? 
? Is the model successful in screening contacts for TB, testing people for HIV, identifying TB cases, linking cases to care in PHCs? 
? Is the yield of TB increased by the addition of culture testing to the current programme? 
? Is the model cost-effective in identifying TB cases, and can implementation be adapted to improve cost-effectiveness? 
? What is the projected impact of contact tracing on transmission, and how do changes in implementation will modify the impact? 
The project will be conducted in three districts of South Africa with different TB epidemic profiles: a) rural district in KwaZulu-Natal, with the highest rates of TB/drug-resistant TB in the country; b) urban district in Gauteng, lower TB incidence; c) semi-urban peri-mine district in North West, moderate TB incidence. We expect that the yield of TB and the logistics of conducting the contact tracing in these three areas will be different, and will allow for a more detailed understanding of what influences cost-effectiveness and impact of the intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>371249</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_16020</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
