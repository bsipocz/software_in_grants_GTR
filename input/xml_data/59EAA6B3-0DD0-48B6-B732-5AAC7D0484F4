In superconductors each spin up electron joins a spindown electron to form what is called a Cooper pair. These are responsiblefor conducting electric current without dissipation. The question arises -what happens when there are more spin up than spin down electrons? What isthe best way to accomodate the extra spin up ones? It turns out that thisis an extremely difficult and still open problem after more than fortyyears. Recently we have a new experimental system - cold gases of atoms (instead ofelectrons) which exhibit the same physics as superconductors and theexperiments are much easier to perform and interpret than with electronsso we have a real opportunity to solve this puzzle. We can also ask whatwould happen if instead of playing with different spins we paired atomswith different masses - a question which cannot be easily asked withelectrons. My research will help to interpret experiments in the search for new phases of matter which are expected to appear in these systems. Further, I hope to be able to provide a unified theoretical framework at the end when the problem is solved.Engineered Quantum Systems: 1) nonequilibrium physics - cold atoms arevery slow and we can change the conditions they experience in the labfaster than the time it takes them to react! We can also photograph themin action. This allows us to study the complicated motions that theyundergo as they rearrange themselves in response tosomething that we did (like compressing them, suddenly giving them moreenergy, etc). This is a new field since other systems (such as electronsin metals) usually move too fast for us to see what they are doing. It is also a new way of exploring so-called many-body quantum mechanics - what happens when there are many atoms in a time-dependent situation. 2) interfaces for quantum information - recent progress in quantum computing has proposed the idea of hybrid quantum computing. Some systems (liketrapped ions) are very good memories for qubits. Others (like solid statenanostructures) work very well as CPUs. How do we transfer qubits betweenthem and which systems couple best? I propose to study a variety ofatom-solid state systems in search of the best interface technology inwhat promises to become a vital area of research in the near future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The direct benefit of this project has been the scientific and technical training of the PhD student who has gone on to work in a major City firm.

In certain gases, atoms like to form diatomic molecules through a very peculiar phenomenon called Cooper pairing. This is similar to what happens in superconductors where the electrons pair up to form di-electronic molecules. We studied the role of interactions in the normal state - the state that precedes this molecule formation and found the equation of state for it. We also studied pairing between atoms with very different masses, which is currently under experimental investigation. We then moved to the study of highly polarised gases - where there is one atom of species A in a gas of species B. This A atom then behaves at very low temperatures as a quasi-atom or quasiparticle - it looks as if it is in vacuum but its mass is different. This is a new frontier in gases that we have opened and which is still being studied. Finally we initiated the study of gases which are placed in very turbulent situations - e.g. when clouds of these gases collide. We were able to explain some strange behaviour that was reported there - why the clouds bounced off each other like ping-pong balls. The equations we used are very general and our application of them is sure to have many follow-ups in the community. (Note: this summary is identical to that of EP/E053033/1 since it is the same project).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Overall the applications are mainly academic. Nevertheless, the field itself is moving in the direction of applications more and more. Things like gravity sensors, more precise atomic clocks and so on are all devices which are being realised with ultracold atoms. This project is not directly connected with those issues but the tools we developed .e.g. our application of the Boltzmann equation for fermions might be useful one day in simulating and designing these devices. The areas of exploitation are mainly in fundamental science. It turns out that cold atomic gases mimic very exotic systems such as neutron stars and the Higgs field in cosmology. So it is likely that these studies will have counterparts in these other areas.

In the are of cold gases they have become mainstream issues with some of the publications having very high impact. The experimental groups are only now beginning to catch up and we hope that many of our predictions will be tested in the near future.
