The project draws from over 10 years of research carried out by the Fellow, Tom Corby, and Research Assistant, Gavin Baily, to develop online artworks that map information retrieved from the Internet into visual images that organize and reveal hidden information structures as visual, interactive, animations. The KT project seeks to exploit these research activities to create a new website platform (ARTLAB) providing innovate interactive and accessible ways for BBC audiences to repurpose and relate to online content.\n\nThe BBC founded its online platform, 'BBC Backstage' in 2005 as part of Learning Development to enable its audiences to recycle its online services and content through user-generated activities, in response to the Graf Report (2004) which stressed the need for the BBC to engage with 'Web 2.0' phenomena, and to develop opportunities for social interactivity. Backstage is tasked to encourage audiences to innovate new information structures using these assets and share the results under open standards remits (i.e. shareable, non-copyrighted material): for example, audiences can dynamically 'tap into' the BBC's 'content feeds' and web-based data streams (e.g. news, weather, financial and geographical data) in order to do this.\n\nThis project is important in that data visualization of this type has become an important contemporary tool for understanding and communicating the complex nature of interactions between the natural, social and economic worlds. This project presents a timely opportunity for a major public institution to directly engage non-specialist wider publics in understanding its practices in a structured and supportive environment.\n\nThe collaboration has a number of aims: to promote the idea that technology when used creatively can develop artifacts that delight, intrigue and move in the same way as other creative media; to enable understanding of scientific and technological processes using assessable visual formats, and to widen public engagement with BBC technological resources using art and design methods.\n\nThe project will be delivered in 3 overlapping phases outlined below with associated outputs: production, mentoring, dissemination.\n\n1. A website will be built (The ARTLAB), to act as a public platform for communication with participants and to publish example artworks and tutorial materials supporting audiences in the creation of their own work. Outreach activities to the press and wider communities publicizing the project will occur as an ongoing project initiative. \n\n2. An ongoing mentoring process will be instigated to support and provide feedback for participating audiences. In addition as part of a declared ethos of the project, audiences will be encouraged to share works and expertise via the site using dedicated online forums. The development of an active self-supporting community that engage via the ARTLAB'S forums will enable the sustainability of the project past its official end date. \n\n3. Dissemination of the of project results will occur in a number of ways: THE ARTLAB DIY MANUAL will be published at the end of the project to provide a commentary and describe how to make works, a public blog will track development, a report for BBC managers will reflect upon and capture good practice, a public exhibition of works produced by participants and a conference will be hosted by the University of Westminster, and in-house BBC meetings will share production innovations developed during the collaboration amongst the wider BBC production community. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate individual and institutional beneficiaries of this Knowledge Transfer (KT) include: BBC audiences and staff and the University of Westminster's (UOW) KT research team, staff and students. Other beneficiaries include public sector institutions engaged with creative digital content outreach strategies (e.g. libraries and museums) and policy makers concerned with public education and skills agendas. \n\nThis KT is directly relevant to the efficient delivery of public policy regarding issues of digital inclusion, literacy and higher-level digital skill development (DCMS, Digital Britain: The Interim Report, 2009). By providing new ways engaging in creative digital output it delivers intrinsic social, cultural and educational benefits for participants that directly impact on their quality of life. Additionally by increasing the number of people able to demonstrate digital life, work and economy skills (e.g. through digital media manipulation) the project produces instrumental impacts that enhance the UK's social capital by increasing knowledge and understanding of digital processes for the wider public. Additionally, the KT produces a project model that helps other public institutions looking to engage in digital inclusion initiatives (Collections Trust, What can the UK Culture Sector do for Digital Britain? 2009) by demonstrating how to activate their existing digital archival assets for the public through processes of creative engagement. Impacts for the BBC occur at social and educational, cultural and organizational levels. The KT shows how the digital arts can operate to swiftly prototype content using emerging and new technologies. This positively impacts on the Corporations ability to efficiently innovate digital projects concerned with provision of user-generated content. BBC staff benefit by learning how academic skills in analysis and critical reflection can productively underpin digital innovation projects and through increased skill development in emerging technology (cognitive growth). As noted by Skillset (2009) there is an economic imperative to generate greater wealth from the development of world-class content which is highly dependent on these types of digital expertise. These impacts allow the BBC to build the public value of its media provision and contribute to wider UK skills needs. The project bequeaths the UOW, staff with current industrial experience enabling it to more effectively adapt it's teaching and learning support to industry skills requirements, e.g. Web based project production schemes derived from BBC Backstage produce direct benefits for staff and students in terms of providing industry level skill-sets that positively impact on career and employment opportunities. UOW also benefits from the increased research opportunities arising from the KT and the experience that participation brings in future development of public facing research initiatives. Timescales for impacts are variable. Immediate benefits for BBC, UOW and audiences are expected to accrue through direct knowledge exchange outcomes occurring during project life cycle. \n\nSpecific timescales for long-term impacts are difficult to predict as many of the benefits are life-long. The persistence of the ARTLAB and its communities beyond project end will however enable the BBC to garner feedback and track future impacts. As a KT project interaction with BBC staff and audiences is central. Audiences are supported through the ARTLAB, a Web hub that disseminates expertise, tutorials and feedback. BBC staff benefit from access to UOW staff with a substantial research record over a 22-month collaborative period. Knowledge co-produced during this period concerning digital outreach programs will be disseminated for other beneficiaries through a project blog, public conference, exhibition, reports and publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project benefits the digital arts by
developing practices and methods for
working with institutionally sited data
sets. Conversely it develops insights for
institutions in how to extend the value
of their existing data resources using
methods of cultural production.
Particular achievements include:

In Innovative integration of media
and data types to produce 'new
content from old'.
DataArt developed several novel
practices for the integration of online
data with video broadcast material,
e.g. 3d Documentary Explorer
combines a BBC 2 documentary The
Virtual Revolution with browsable web
page material in a 3D interface
enabling viewers to research topics
connected to the broadcast at the
same time as viewing it (an approach
further refined in TV Related Content).

 Produced new ways of perceiving
trends in the historic archives of
news reports.
In visualizing news archives over
extended periods of time, DataArt
showed how experimental visual,
animated and behavioral languages
articulate hidden patterns in media,
thereby enabling critical analysis of
news reporting. For example, in Locus
and NewsTraces data was formatted
using a timeline in ways that enabled
reflection on how media organizations
prioritize specific topics.

 Insights into how critical digital
arts practices can produce deeper
understandings of institutional data
archives by laying bare
programmatic data structures.
Following digital arts practices that
seek to demystify and enable public
access to digital technologies,
DataArt argued that the production of
singular 'black-boxed' information
visualizations in their own right should
be supplemented with extended
information around their programming
and use of data. Wherever possible
visualizations where released with
open-source computer code, data
resources and production notes
showing how the work was made and
enabling others to produce their own
versions of the work.

Creative strategies for multi-level
public dissemination of institutional
data sets through the use of online
and offline social activities.
The project argues that public
consumption of institutional data be
augmented by activities that enable
deeper understandings of what it is.
To do this, the project established
resources and events that enabled
direct access to and feedback from the
researchers via a web presence (the
DataArt forum/blog), and hands-on
engagement with the project via public
workshops held at the BBC, University
of Westminster and the various festivals
where the project was shown.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0248AF1-7B7F-4238-81F0-FAE3354AE453</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543bc732558ed8.86852601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project made contributions to the digital arts by providing a collaborative model of practice for actively engaging with large-scale institutions. While the use of data is commonplace within media arts, practitioners generally work at arms-length from the organisations producing it. By developing practices and methods for working with institutionally-sited data sets the project uniquely devised solutions for a methodological lacuna. Conversely, it developed insights for institutions in how to extend the value of their existing data resources using experimental methods of cultural production. 

Particular contributions included:

a) Innovative integration of media and data types to produce 'new content from old'.

DataArt developed several novel practices for the mashing of online data with broadcast material, e.g., 3D Documentary Explorer combines a BBC2 documentary The Virtual Revolution with browsable web material to enable contextualization of the viewing experience.

b) Produced new ways of perceiving trends in the historic archives of news reports.

In disseminating these contributions the project was exhibited at 3 international digital arts festivals, was presented at 4 conferences and symposia, was the subject of 1 peer reviewed paper published in Leonardo, and was nominated for an award at the Networked and Electronic Media (NEM) Festival, Barcelona in 2012. The Guardian newspaper twice featured the project in the 'Data Store' section of its website, evidencing interest in the project beyond digital arts disciplines and demonstrating the wider reach and relevance of research.

Additionally I organized a 1-day conference at Westminster Public 2.0: Culture, Creativity and
Audience in an Era of Information Openness (2011). As with the previous Data Landscapes symposium, I brought together a wide spectrum of contributors from industry, thereby demonstrating my ability to attract and coalesce contributors from disparate subject domains to engage issues of shared concern. Speakers included: Simon Rogers, editor of the Guardian Datablog, Ian Forrester, Senior Producer at BBC R&amp;amp;D, Roland Harwood, co-founder of 100%Open an innovation agency; Rob Myers, artist, writer, hacker and Chief Technology Officer for Philter Phactory; Julian Tate lead developer on the Manchester Open Data Cities project and Ruth Catlow, media artist and co-director of Furtherfield.org media arts organization amongst others.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As detailed in the impact narrative a range of models of practice, approaches to integrating data and broadcast material were developed including a 3-D interface for the Virtual Revolution series on BBC 2.
