Symmetry is an important concept throughout science, particularly in physics and chemistry, as well as in every area of mathematics. My work touches on many areas of mathematics, including algebra, logic and topology. You can think of topology as ''rubber geometry' - topologists are allowed to stretch objects, but never tear them. I solve algebraic problems by translating them into geometry or topology - I am often amazed at the elegant and simple solutions that arise from this approach to hard algebraic problems.In geometric group theory, we study ''groups via their ''actions on geometric objects: a ''group is the technical term in mathematics for a collection of symmetries of an object; we say that the group ''acts on the object. Mathematicians work with many different sorts of geometries. I am most interested in ''hyperbolic geometry , in which the angles in a triangle add up to less than 180 degrees (unlike the standard ''Euclidean geometry, in which they add up to exactly 180 degrees). Hyperbolic geometry is tricky to visualize, but many different spaces exhibit some form of hyperbolic geometry. For instance, it is a remarkable fact that a ''randomly chosen group will almost certainly act on a hyperbolic space. Such groups are called ''hyperbolic groups .In this project, I will pursue two questions about infinite hyperbolic groups. An infinite group can be a daunting object to study, and both my lines of enquiry involve simplifying one's perspective.My first question concerns ''separability , in which we ask how much of the group we can see if we restrict our attention to actions on finite objects. I propose to prove that certain important kinds of hyperbolic groups are ''subgroup separable . Roughly speaking, this says that, even though the groups in question are infinite, we can recapture a lot of their structure by looking only at their actions on finite objects.This will resolve several important open questions in low-dimensional topology, including a longstanding problem posed by Andrew Casson. The theory of 3-dimensional topology is dominated by several outstanding conjectures; this result will clarify the relationship between them, by showing that two of them are equivalent. It will also provide important evidence for one of these conjectures.My second question concerns those properties of a group that we can describe using only simple logical terms. The ''elementary properties of a group are the ones that you can write down using only ''and , ''or and ''not , as well as ''for all and ''there exists . Taken together, all the elementary properties of a group collectively form the ''elementary theory of that group. I propose to prove, with Daniel Groves, that the elementary theory of every hyperbolic group is ''decidable . This means that every hyperbolic group has an algorithm that takes an elementary property as input and determines whether or not it is true in that group.This project will broaden and clarify recent monumental work on the elementary theory of hyperbolic groups. My work on this subject has already produced theorems of widespread interest, and I expect many more. We believe that a successful resolution of this question will lead to important advances in our understanding of the structure of hyperbolic groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ACADEMIC BENEFICIARIES The proposed research will benefit mathematicians conducting research in the areas of: 1. low-dimensional topology 2. geometric group theory, and 3. logic. The results of the research will be posted on the preprint server at www.arxiv.org and submitted to most high-profile peer-reviewed journals. I will give talks at academic seminars, colloquia, and domestic and international conferences. My collaborator, Daniel Groves of the University of Illinois at Chicago, will also give talks in similar contexts. The requested DPhil student will give talks at academic seminars and domestic conferences. WIDER IMPACTS Anyone who needs to understand a system whose configurations can be modelled by a hyperbolic space is a potential beneficiary of this project. They will benefit from the considerable advances in the current understanding of these spaces that the project aims to provide. As the potential beneficiaries are a disparate group, in both the academic and non-academic sectors, I aim to bring my research to as wide an audience as possible using the internet. The main tool will be a blog, hosted at wordpress.com. Blogs have made it possible for mathematicians to communicate with a diverse audience much more effectively than before, and I have a successful track record in this area. The websites www.tricki.com and mathoverflow.org are also valuable online resources for disseminating mathematical ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183390</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>[Note that award EP/I003843/2 is a continuation of award EP/I003843/1.

In this fellowship, we studied symmetries of geometric objects (negatively and non-positively curved spaces), and applied our results to topology and logic. The symmetries of negatively curved spaces are called *hyperbolic groups*.

Here is a summary of our achievements.

- The motivating examples of hyperbolic groups come from 2-dimensional surfaces, but we still don't know whether hyperbolic groups must contain surface groups. Th PI and his coauthors made progress on this question in several directions: we found surface groups, and even 3-dimensional manifold groups, in &amp;quot;randomly chosen&amp;quot; hyperbolic groups; we also showed that certain simple examples of hyperbolic groups always contain even simpler hyperbolic subgroups (though we don't know that these simpler subgroup have to come from surfaces).

- The logic of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; groups of symmetries is an important topic of research, and many teams are trying to extend these results to hyperbolic groups. But this presents certain technical problems, mainly that the subgroups of hyperbolic groups can be extremely complicated. The PI and his coauthor developed a toolkit to deal with these technical problems. This is a basic prerequisite for a rigorous treatment of the algorithmic study of the logic of hyperbolic groups.

- Undecidability results can be some of the most influential results in pure mathematics. They show that certain computations can never be solved by computer, and can warn researchers away from years of wasted research! The PI and his coauthors showed that some very natural questions about hyperbolic groups are undecidable. An attractive example is the question 'Does it map to an infinite group of matrices?' Even stronger undecidability results were proved for questions about groups of symmetries of non-positively curved spaces: the question 'Does it map to *any* group of matrices with more than one element?' was proved to be undecidable.

- The theory of hyperbolic groups is very successful, but the definitions are 'coarse', meaning that they don't capture any fine structure. The class of CAT(-1) groups is similar, but does capture fine structure, and we don't know whether ever hyperbolic group is CAT(-1). Brown showed that some important classes of hyperbolic groups (including 'limit groups', which arise in the study of logic) are CAT(-1).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All of these developments open new doors in the field of geometric group theory. The techniques developed to find interesting subgroups of hyperbolic groups point the way towards further attacks on the question of surface subgroups, and also to similar questions, such as the question of the existence of subgroups of finite index. The toolkit developed to study the logic of hyperbolic groups will enable rigorous investigations of algorithmic problems in the area. Brown's work on CAT(-1) structures develops new techniques to work on the problem of which hyperbolic groups are CAT(-1).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E58420B-40D1-4BF0-9C7C-74953DE609B0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dea0c2af4da7.19413204</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://arxiv.org/find/grp_math/1/au:+wilton_h*/0/1/0/all/0/1</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3C502975-F4A8-4ECF-BB82-81D8DC745E91</gtr:id><gtr:title>The
