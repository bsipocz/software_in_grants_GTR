Vigorous expansion of pan-Arab television programming for children seems to have taken place as an afterthought to the main thrust of the Arab satellite explosion, with the result that research on pan-Arab children's TV is lacking in both quantity and quality. A lack of knowledge on this issue - and thus in international understanding - matters, because under-18s comprise nearly twice as big a proportion of the population in key Arab countries (39-40% in Egypt and Saudi Arabia) as they do in European countries (22% in Britain and France). Moreover, pan-Arab satellite channels are watched more than terrestrial television in most Arab households, with Eutelsat in 2010 recording satellite penetration rates of 64% in Egypt and 100% in Saudi Arabia. Recent political upheavals affecting Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Syria, largely driven by disaffected youth, make it increasingly urgent to gain a better understanding of children and young people.

In the pre-satellite era Arab governments relied on broadcast monopolies to disregard television viewers' real information and entertainment needs. Competition among privately-owned Arab satellite channels led to the introduction of new content in the 1990s and 2000s. In aiming at children, however, these channels relied heavily on imported cartoons. Indigenous production initiatives came later. 

To grasp the nature of what is being produced and distributed it is necessary to examine pan-Arab broadcasters who provide for children, as well as the production houses and dubbing and animation services they rely on, to learn more about the practices and dynamics at work in these institutions and in Arab state regulation of children's content. Since Arab broadcasters buy foreign animation and formats and collaborate with non-Arab suppliers, sponsors, trainers and co-producers, there is also a need to evaluate the basis and longevity of such trade and collaboration, as well as ways in which trends in the global marketplace influence pan-Arab television for children. At the same time it is crucial to discover how children perceive and use pan-Arab satellite television content, both in Arab countries and in Arabic-speaking households in Europe. 

Given these aims and objectives the research will adopt a three-pronged approach, which has proved effective in previous research on children's media culture, whereby institutions, texts and audiences are studied simultaneously. We will interview key personnel working for Arab broadcasters and the companies that supply them, while observing the processes by which children's programmes are commissioned, piloted and produced. Interviews and observations will be informed by critical analysis of relevant reports from companies and the trade press and of selected samples of indigenous children's programming. The research team will benefit from existing contacts and previous research in the region to organise audience research in households and among schoolchildren, in order to explore how they negotiate television output in developing self-identity and perceptions of otherness. 

This three-pronged method will help build up a holistic picture of the commercial and non-commercial factors that underlie the evolving ecology of pan-Arab children's television and children's reception of it. It will enrich our understanding of childhood and media use in parts of the Arab region and inform creative industry players in the UK digital economy and UK export and service industries about the trajectories of development in a part of the world where societies are struggling to benefit from global integration and preserve their own separate national and pan-Arab identities all at the same time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Benefits beyond academia will materialise before the end of Yr 1, continuing for at least 7 years from the project's start. 
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
1. TV/digital media companies (UK or other) producing/distributing content for children via Arab TV.
2. Companies (UK or other) supplying educational materials/consultancy to the Arab world.
3. Arab children and their families who might benefit from improved content as a result of the project's findings.
4. UK govt. depts. that promote creative industries/exports.
5. Export associations of UK TV companies/producers.
6. Members of the diplomatic service, foreign policy advisers, the UK Department for International Development (DfID) and its EU and US counterparts.
7. International educational/cultural organisations (British Council, Anna Lindh Foundation, Alliance for Civilizations), charities (Save the Children), UN agencies (UNICEF, UNESCO) and other funding bodies (EU).

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT? Our research addresses issues of culture and communication that affect a statistically large and strategically important segment of the population in an unstable region bordering Europe. The stakes are high for future UK and European success in managing relations with Arab countries and navigating the uncertainties caused by decades of authoritarian rule and challenges posed to the old order by a new digitally literate generation. Since today's children are the voters and politicians of tomorrow the ways in which Arab children learn to make sense of the world around them can provide pointers to the future. Pan-Arab television is an important component in public communication between Arabic-speaking children and adults. By gaining insights into all aspects of this changing field of cultural production and related state interventions, our research will contribute to and inform greater knowledge/understanding by industry practitioners, policymakers and advocates/funders of educational initiatives for Arab children. 

Several Gulf states are launching major cultural and educational developments, such as the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and 'education cities' in Qatar and the UAE, which depend heavily on non-Arab input. Linked to this growth is a decisive shift towards the use of English in Gulf education and thus an ever-widening market for UK-based publishers. An even newer shift lies in belated awakening of local elites' interest in developing 'culturally appropriate' material for Arabic-speaking children. Since Gulf investors are the main financiers of pan-Arab children's programming, pan-Arab television constitutes a key site for negotiation of competing pressures regarding what is considered culturally, politically and linguistically appropriate. Our study of these pressures and how they are negotiated will enhance/foster awareness/understanding and the potential performance of any institution with commercial, strategic or philanthropic interests in cultural/educational developments across the Arab world. 

To ensure users benefit our research will necessitate sound relations with key personnel involved in Arab cultural production for children. Maintaining good contact with respondents is both a key component of the study and an integral part of the Pathways to Impact. The investigators will use their extensive industry contacts, forged through previous research to communicate findings formally and informally. For this the Arab Media Centre's June 2010 conference on 'Children's TV in the Arab World' has already served as a launch pad. The research project itself envisages 
(a) An industry-academe workshop in the UK 
(b) Expert roundtables in Lebanon and Morocco 
(c) A final knowledge transfer conference in the UK.
All the above will involve a significant non-academic presence. A report and press releases on project findings will be released at the final conference in English and Arabic, with an Arabic summary distributed to Arabic-speaking research participants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Deakin University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Joint hosting of London symposium on Transnational Children's Television and Audiences with Deakin University, Melbourne, October 2014</gtr:description><gtr:id>DF67B091-ABC0-4325-9381-A24BF413E23C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

Through its focus on producers' objectives and their perceptions of children and child audiences, the workshop revealed that even the most prominent and senior practitioners mostly saw audience research as an activity foreign to their concerns and regarded the 'child audience' as a monolithic entity. Over the course of the workshop however, some participants began to see the significance of qualitative, child-centred, audience research in their field, including ethnographic research methods with which they were previously unfamiliar. Many expressed an intention to apply the knowledge and to stay in touch with each other.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c3f0da10e672.96748295-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Jordan Media Institute in Amman provided a venue (cost JOD900) and patronage for the one-and-a-half-day workshop held there on 1-2 June 2016; invitations named JMI as co-host and senior JMI personnel advised on the participants list.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>One member of research team stayed on at the University of Westminster after her AHRC-funded RA contract had ended in order to organise a short workshop at the Jordan Media Institute in Amman, Jordan.

This was a 22-page, 4,000-word illustrated document desktop-published in colour by the University of Westminster, divided into sections on: Dialogue and Outreach; Research Methods; Policy Findings; Production Findings; Textual Analysis Findings; and Audience Findings. It was released in hard copy in English at a knowledge transfer conference for practitioners and academics hosted by the University of Westminster as part of the research project on 4 September 2015. It was then posted online in Arabic and English, and circulated as a soft copy (pdf) in both languages to key informants, who then suggested other suitable recipients. Key informants were positive about the validity and relevance of the findings.
The document has subsequently been distributed to, or personally brought to the attention of, numerous bodies working on children's media or with children and young people in the Arab region. These include, but are not limited to: Kalimat Foundation, IZI, Prix Jeunesse, Children's Media Foundation, Bidaya Media, Majid Entertainment, Blink Studios, Cartoon Network Arabia, Jordan Pioneers, British Council, Anna Lindh Foundation, Child Rights International Network, Media Diversity Institute, International Broadcasting Trust, Public Media Alliance, UNICEF, BBC Media Action, the European Broadcasting Union, and the Jordan Media Institute (JMI). JMI provided the venue for an event in Amman in June 2016 specifically to disseminate the findings to Arab creatives working in the field of children's media, with a view to thinking through the implications for innovations in screen content. The University of Westminster funded a London-based coordinator for this event, who used the Findings Report as a working document to devise the event subgroups and sessions and liaise with Jordanian and other Arab media to ensure that media coverage would take the issues forward. The University also funded participation of three research team members; participants from most institutions attending the event paid their own travel and accommodation to take part. 
Meetings held in Morocco and Lebanon in preparation for ethnographic fieldwork in these countries also provided other pathways to impact as they enabled research team members involved with audience research to share the methodological findings of their UK audience research with non-academic informants. In Morocco these included representatives of the country's audiovisual regulator and in Lebanon they included TV producers and NGO activists. Receipt of a British Academy International Partnership and Mobility Award for 2016-17 has now facilitated further interaction with Moroccan academics, broadcast regulators and politicians with a view to drafting and disseminating a policy paper on screen content for Moroccan children.
Through contacts with the European Broadcasting Union's Young Audiences section, two members of the research team were invited to present findings from the research to television and Internet creatives and executives attending the 3rd Global Kids Media Congress in March 2017. Subsequent discussions at the GKMC with representatives of BBC Children's, IZI (part of Bavarian Broadcasting), the UK film production and media research company Tomorrow's Child, and others indicated there could be further collaborations involving reference to the AHRC-funded research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>96DB7F8A-9BB9-4B40-891A-09F6ADEBCAC3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545f78ab2ad388.23306545</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Findings can be categorized on the basis of: production and political economy fieldwork (conducted in Abu Dhabi, Doha, Dubai, the West Bank, independent producers and consultants in UK and Europe); textual analysis (conducted on Emirati animation series Mansour; Qatar's Jeem TV live studio programme Anbar; Beit Byoot live studio programme on Palestine TV; and Tuyur al-Jannah channel; ethnographic fieldwork with children aged 7-12. The latter consisted of creative workshops with groups of children, followed by family visits. Allowing for the fact that some children covered by family visits also took part in the workshops, the ethnographic fieldwork covered a total of 85 Arabic-speaking children through workshops and family visits in the UK in 2013-14 (10 in pilot, 24 in workshops and 4 in family visits) and Morocco in 2014 (21 children in workshops, 6 in family visits) and Lebanon in 2015 (24 Syrian and Lebanese children in workshops and 5 in family visits). Findings are also methodological, including researchers' own breakthroughs/reflections as well as data on local attitudes to child-friendly qualitative research methods collected during roundtables with Moroccan and Lebanese academics in September 2013 and February 2015.
Production and regulatory findings relate to: disruptions in building local children's TV production communities; lack of urgency attached to creating local content; missing links in supply chains; approaches to intercultural collaboration; personnel and decision-making bottlenecks affecting Gulf initiatives. Textual analysis findings relate to: dominance of didacticism; contradictions arising from emphasis on Arab-Islamic cultural heritage; conservatism in gender roles. Reception findings relate to: avenues to gaining trust and access; diversity and ingenuity of children's media use in terms of platform and content even among disadvantaged and refugee children; some children's liking for songs and children's singing. Variations in educational settings and outcomes emerged as the prime variable affecting children's worldview and identity formation in the three audience fieldwork sites. Methodological findings relate to: need for radical adaptation of viewing diaries in different countries because of different educational outcomes; eagerness among young Arab researchers to adopt hitherto unfamiliar qualitative methods; team researchers' positionality as both insiders and outsiders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Implications of the findings arise in terms of: raising the issue of children's media as more of a priority for local cultural policy makers; regulatory measures needed to stimulate local production of high quality screen content for children; reorienting the adult-centred approach of much local children's programming to make it more child-centred; developing qualitative research with child audiences; building holistic support communities for children's screen content, consisting not only of producers but funders, educationists, media monitors, etc. These avenues will be explored with individuals in the fields of media policy, regulation, advocacy, education, audience research and journalists/media commentators who can lead public debates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4A21BE74-C659-49B9-8956-DD61CE8CFE4D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f7107e4c127.29586616</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.westminster.ac.uk/arab-media-centre/research</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influenced Arab media practitioners' perceptions of child audiences through workshop run by three research team members in Amman</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D211DA7D-0A9D-4464-9C6F-A52763A2C92B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>24 participants involved in various aspects of producing screen content for children took part in a one-and-a-half day workshop in Amman, Jordan, focused on participants' objectives and perceptions when creating content for children. The participants included 13 from Jordan, four from Palestine, four from the UAE, two from Lebanon and one from Saudi Arabia. Using results from the audience strand of the AHRC-funded research project as a basis for interactive discussions, three members of the research team discovered that even the most experienced participants were mostly unfamiliar with qualitative methods of audience research, seeing this field of enquiry as foreign to their professional activities and regarding the 'child audience' as a monolithic entity. Over the course of the workshop however, some began to see significance of getting closer to children's needs and wants through child-centred research approaches and indicated that these concerns would influence their future work. The participants included scriptwriters, composers, creative directors, animators, a puppeteer and an arts centre founder.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c882ac90a2.17800308</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Pre-summit workshop hosted by Commonwealth Broadcasting Association at World Summit on Media for Children in Kuala Lumpur, run by two research team members</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D1A293F2-E90E-4AC1-842C-507024178397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>40 participants in the workshop (entitled 'Children's Content at the Core of Public Service Broadcasting') acquired analytical tools to evaluate different models of public service broadcasting provision for children around the globe, compare the quality and originality of programme outputs, and assess the level of support received from regulators.
