One important example is the field of Atto-second Science where laser light and the electrons of matter interact on the atto-second time-scale making possible, for example, the shortest-ever pulses of VUV light. One atto-second is only one millionth-millionth-millionth of a second but electrons driven by strong laser light collide violently with others and move distances large compared to the size of an atom on the atto-second time-scale of several hundred atto-seconds. Another important example is the recent appreciation that ionizing radiation damages living animals and plants by bringing about strand breaks in the DNA molecule through a multi-electron interaction.Such newly emerging areas of Science involve large experimental teams in the UK and around the world who publish their research findings in top journals such as Nature and Science. Despite this, there does not yet exist anywhere in the world a set of computer codes capable of calculations of sufficient sophistication to be useful in conjunction with the laboratory experiment effort, in driving the Science forward. Such calculations demand the full power of present (and prospective) High Performance Computing - available through machines which presently can cost 100M and upwards.The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a suite of high-quality computer codes that will be widely used; will harness such high performance computing machines most effectively over many years; and will relate directly to areas of Science (brief descriptions of two such areas given above) where a detailed account of multi-electron dynamics in electrons and molecules is essential to driving the Science forward.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>130200</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK R-matrix Atomic and Molecular Physics HPC Code Development Project (UK-RAMP): EPSRC Grant EP/G055599/1</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4882823-6E79-4BF9-AF0E-A5E971795E29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EPSRC Software Development Project. UK-RAMP is a four-site collaboration. The other three grants (apart from DL) are listed as partners. Professor Hugo van der Hart (QUB, grant EP/G055416/1), is the lead PI for the overall grant. Dr Jimena Gorfinkiel (EPSRC Grant EP/G055599/1) is local PI for OU. The DL section provided general computational development and best practice support across all four sites particularly for repository develepment of 'UKRMol'. DL worked specifically to incorporate the atomic code 'PFARM' into the UKRMol molecular package (OU/UCL), allowing scientific outputs and papers. It also introduced further parallelization into UKRMol and QUB code RMT by obtaining related funding for relevant activities (via Daresbury's core support SLA for CCPQ, HECToR dCSE funding, ARCHER eCSE funding and through two short-term PRACE development projects) .
Main OU outputs: a working UKRMol site and code: the paper describing this (Carr et al 2012) has, as of February 2016, had 43 citations. The PFARM adaptation to UKRMol has been used for electron-molecule calculations of resonances in RNA bases and electron methane collisions so far. Further development of the UKRMol code, now called UKRMol+, is underway, supported at DL by EPSRC's Service Level Agreement for core support for CCPQ. 
Added February 2017: As a direct successor of the UK-RAMP grant a new CCP Software Flagship Grant EP/P022146/1 (2017-2019) has been awarded to QUB (van der Hart) with OU (Gorfinkiel) as co-investigator. This development builds on the unification of the atomic and molecular packages and will develop code for time-dependent laser pulse interactions with molecular electrons and arbitrary polarization of the pulse for atomic electrons.

This code was optimized to run as a fully heterogeneous (host and phi cores working simultaneously) application on a multi-node Xeon-Phi platform. The work was presented by M Lysaght (ICHEC Dublin) and is listed in the publications section (~50% contribution from M Plummer and AG Sunderland as part of CCPQ core support).
In addition, the parallel molecular resonance code TIMEDEL has been published in Computer Physics Communications. Much optimization work has been performed on UKRMol+, the molecular inner region codes. The RMT code has been added to CCPForge. Various other publications and optimization support work (not directly related to the UK-RAMP award, eg in antimatter or strongly correlated systems) has taken place.

This CCPQ network is a renewal of network EP/J010561 and the general description of that partnership applies here. The current network grant is from August 2015 to 2020. M Plummer (with A G Sunderland) continues to provide support for the atomic and molecular R-matrix packages and for antimatter work: other members of SCD provide support to the other aspects of CCPQ work. 
As noted in outputs below, the parallel molecular resonance code TIMEDEL has been published in Computer Physics Communications. Much optimization work has been performed on UKRMol+, the molecular inner region codes (a project to extend the UKRMol inner region basis sets to incorporate B-splines and use a more explicitly object-oriented approach to allow much more complexity in the target molecule descriptions). MP is continuing development work on a general inner region double-continuum atomic R-matrix code.
The RMT code has been added to CCPForge. Various other publications and optimization support activities by SCD members at Daresbury and RAL (not directly related to the UK-RAMP award, eg in antimatter or strongly correlated systems) have taken place.
The CCPQ website has been thoroughly revamped and relaunched.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK R-matrix Atomic and Molecular Physics HPC Code Development Project (UK-RAMP): EPSRC Grant EP/G055556/1</gtr:description><gtr:id>732ED1F9-F37C-4BEC-971B-DC24C00667F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Hugo van der Hart (QUB, grant EP/G055416/1), is the lead PI for the overall grant.

Main UCL outputs: a working UKRMol site and code: the paper describing this (Carr et al 2012) has, as of February 2016, had 43 citations. The PFARM adaptation to UKRMol has been used for electron-molecule calculations of resonances in RNA bases and electron methane collisions so far. The DL PRACE 3IP extra funding parallelized a resonance-finding module of UKRmol called TIMEDEL which was developed serially at UCL. A PRACE white paper has been published. Further development has greatly extended the parallelism, with much wider applications, and a joint paper on the serial and parallel TIMEDEL module is due to be submitted/published in 2016 (joint UCL-DL) . Note added February 2017: the TIMEDEL paper has been published in Computer Physics Communications (see publications list): this paper is a legacy of UK-RAMP and also due to continuing core support for CCPQ from the SLA.

It also introduced further parallelization into UKRMol and QUB code RMT by obtaining related funding for relevant activities (via Daresbury's core support SLA for CCPQ, HECToR dCSE funding, ARCHER eCSE funding and through two short-term PRACE development projects) .</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Physics?&amp; Astronomy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Quantum dynamics in Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics (CCPQ: EPSRC Grant EP/J010561/1; previously CCP2, EPSRC grant EP/G003459/1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>04C237A4-35A3-414B-89AD-93F0A7811668</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Specific to the collaboration with the DL part of the UK-RAMP project: a HECToR dCSE contract, an ARCHER eCSE contract, PRACE 3IP development funding (and influence on PRACE 2IP funding for CCPQ-related work).

MP's work as CCPQ core support has shared interests with UK-RAMP's work in addition to the specific UK-RAMP tasks of general 'best practice' advice/management and overseeing the adaptation of PFARM for the UKRMol package. MP (with AGS and Hugo van der Hart, QUB PI) was respoinsible for obtaining a HECToR dCSE contract for enhnced parallelization of the PRMAT inner region package, which will feed into UK-RAMP: this is included as 'extra funding' and the report is included in the published outputs (and should be considered as weighted 0.15 UK-RAMP, 0.85 CCPQ). In summer 2014, he was co-applicant for an ARCHER eCSE contract lead by HvdH for optimized parallelization of the RMT code for Tier-0 architectures. This contract at QUB begins in October 2014 (this is a UK-RAMP success backed up withnh SCD expertise.
As part of CCPQ support, AGS and MP successfully applied for PRACE 2IP funding for further optimization of PFARM and adaptation for GPU and Xeon-Phi clusters. This optimization and novel technology porting will feed back into UK-RAMP science (a CECAM workshop talk on this work is included in the publication outputs, to be weighted 0.9 CCPQ, 0.1 UK-RAMP). Further work on this, in a new informal collaboration with ICHEC Dublin, was reported at the 2015 EMIT conference (see publications) as a presentation and a report. MP and AGS also applied for PRACE 3IP funding of 3.5 months FTE to work on parallelization of the UKRMol TIMEDEL resonance-finding package. This is a direct follow-up to the UK-RAMP adaptation of PFARM to UKRMol: it is included as 'extra funding' and the resulting PRACE white paper is a UK-RAMP publication (~0.8 Uk-RAMP, 0.2 CCPQ). A more wide-ranging and very flexible extension of the parallelization of TIMEDEL took place over 2015.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CCPQ is an EPSRC collaborative computational project. The grant EP/J010561 is for a network and a particular flagship research project (based at Oxford and UCL). It also has associated core support from STFC SCD (Scientific Computing Department) provided through EPSRC's SLA (Service Level Agreement). All four UK-RAMP local PIs are on the CCPQ network Steering Panel. MP (local UK-RAMP PI at DL) is CCPQ secretary and is funded through the SLA to give core support to CCPQ. Since 2012 UK-RAMP MP was funded 0.85FTE through this core support and 0.15FTE as UK-RAMP investigator. MP was also funded through core support for the earlier network grant EP/G003459/1 prior to the current network.
MP's CCPQ duties include general management of the electron atom collisions PRMAT code package, part of which (the PFARM code) was specifically adapted for electron molecule collisions during UK-RAMP. He is also responsible for managing the enhanced parallelization of the 'inner region' PRMAT codes and adapting them for double-continuum processes which will eventually feed into the QUB RMT codes.

Further updates will be made in the future. We note that the DL part of UK-RAMP was based on computational and best-practice developments, with science applications being discussed in the QUB/OU/UCL key findings and narrative impact. A particular non-academic impact is the use of UKRmol by the company Quantemol which provides companies with software to perform simulations relevant to industrial plasmas. The UKRmol software allows detailed ab initio data to be calculated as part of the various simulation packages offered by the company. Resonance-finding codes (such as TIMEDEL) have been used to provide resonance data which may be linked to (eg) strand-breaking in DNA. 
As of 2014 (the date recorded in the 'date' section of narrative impact):
The CCPForge repository is very successful and its prinicples have been used and adapted by other, separate, projects in the overall atomic and molecular physics area, in particular the Tensor Network Theory (TNT) project which treats very strongly correlated many-body interactions. The PFARM interface to UKRMol is complete and has already resulted in scientifc studies and publications (science outputs of UK-RAMP are described in more detail in the QUB/UCL/OU key findings, as DL concentrated on computational matters). The diverse atomic and molecular R-Matric codes (PRMAT/PFARM, UKRMol, RMT) are in use on HPC platforms (with some modules already adapted for 'GPU' and 'Xeon-Phi' new technology), a further post-UK-RAMP code optimization 'eCSE' project underway for RMT (for use on the highest level 'Tier 0' platforms) and the communities developing them are working together.
As of February 2016:
The impact described above has continued. Work at DL, supported by EPSRC's Service Level Agreement for core support for the Collaborative Computational Projects, in this case CCPQ, has continued with further on-going ambitious code development and support for university-based code development in both the atomic and molecular areas of UK-RAMP. This work has also helped to maintain the contact and cross-fertilization between the communities. One immediate technical impact in this period is that one of the UK-RAMP codes has been 'properly' adapted for running on novel technology platform 'Xeon-Phi cluster' making full use of the properties of this heterogeneous ('host plus co-processor') system.
Added February 2017: We note that PFARM is now part of the PRACE Accelerator Benchmark Suite for general performance benchmarking of HPC systems. A parallel version of the UKRmol-out code TIMEDEL has been published in Computer Physics Communications. The UKRMol-in code is being / has been rewritten (by UK-RAMP's OU branch and collaborators), as UKRmol+, in fully object-oriented Fortran 2003 with some CCPQ core support from Daresbury, and will be used by (eg) Quantemol.
Added February 2017: As a direct successor of the UK-RAMP grant a new CCP Software Flagship Grant EP/P022146/1 (2017-2019) has been awarded to QUB (van der Hart) with OU (Gorfinkiel) as co-investigator. This development builds on the unification of the atomic and molecular packages and will develop code for time-dependent laser pulse interactions with molecular electrons and arbitrary polarization of the pulse for atomic electrons. CCPQ SLA core support will assist this project. Further outputs related to UK-RAMP in these areas will be associated with the new grant.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B4C5B64F-71E1-4CB7-A98D-107C4014A64B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54620ea0255119.31792903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC Software Development Project UK-RAMP is a four-site collaboration. The other three grants (QUB, UCL, OU) are listed as partners. Professor Hugo van der Hart (QUB) is overall PI. The scientific code developed by UK-RAMP at QUB, UCL and OU treats the interactions of atoms and molecules with collding electrons and with light (laser pulses on both the femtosecond and attosecond scales) in full detail, solving the full Schrodinger equation for many-electron systems using the 'R-matrix' method. The scientific applications range from astrophysics and atmospheric physics and chemistry to industrial plasmas (lighting, molecular resonance processes affecting engines engines) and biological processes including the detailed mechanisms occurring in radiation damage to DNA/RNA. In attosecond science laser light and the electrons of matter interact on the atto-second time-scale making possible, for example, the shortest-ever pulses of VUV light. One atto-second is only one millionth-millionth-millionth of a second but electrons driven by strong laser light collide violently with others and move distances large compared to the size of an atom on the atto-second time-scale of several hundred atto-seconds.
The UK-RAMP project has, at QUB developed from scratch a new 'R-matrix'-based code, RMT, that can treat laser atom interactions by solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. At UCL/OU, the molecular R-Matrix package UKRMol has been completely upgraded (and is currently in the process of being extended to even more ambitious applications as a result of this upgrade) and formed into a sustainable repository-based modern code on the UK academic sourceforge system CCPForge, along with much new coding (described in the OU/UCL key findings) and interface development to the appropriate part of the RMT code to allow future treatment molecules in laser pulses.
The main purpose of the DL part of UK-RAMP has been to assist with sustainable software development and to agree coding standards so that the codes will be future-proof, as well as assistence with use of the codes on parallel High Performance Computing platforms (and to be ready for new HPC computer technologies). Particular assistence was given to the UKRMol CCPForge repository, with UKRMol being accessed by a wide group of developers and users. DL also had a specific task to interface part of UKRMol, 'UKRMol-in', to 'PFARM', a massively parallel 'outer region' part of the of electron-atom R-matrix code PRMAT: R-matrix theory separates configuration space into two regions divided by a sphere. While the full mathematical solution of the Schrodinger equation is not affected by this division, computationally the inner and outer region codes are distinct and rely on separate methods with distinct opportunities for efficiency, parallelization, optimization etc. 
The CCPForge repository is very successful and its prinicples have been used and adapted by other, separate, projects in the overall atomic and molecular physics area, in particular the Tensor Network Theory (TNT) project which treats very strongly correlated many-body interactions.

The communities developing the codes are working together effcieintly as a team (before UK-RAMP, atomic and molecular code developments were becoming a little isolated from each other).
