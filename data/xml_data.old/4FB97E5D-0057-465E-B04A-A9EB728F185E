In other words, despite the fact that the initial phase space is infinite-dimensional, there is a possibility that after an &amp;quot;unimportant&amp;quot; transient behaviour is discarded, the dynamics can be described by finitely many parameters which satisfying a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) - the so-called inertial form (IF). This idea is widely used, in particular, in modern theories of turbulence, in order to justify various scales (inertial, dissipative, etc.), energy cascades, and Kolmogorov laws. However, the precise and clear meaning of the above mentioned finite-dimensional reduction remains a mystery, despite the fundamental significance of the problem and permanent interest to it by the experts from various fields of science.
 
Rigorously, the finite-dimensional reduction is justified in the case where the so-called inertial manifold (IM) exists. By definition, it is a finite-dimensional smooth invariant manifold in the phase space which attracts exponentially all other trajectories. Then, the IF is generated just by restricting the system to this invariant manifold. However, the existence of an IM requires the so called spectral gap conditions (SG) which are not satisfied in many interesting examples. In particular, the existence or non-existence of the IM for the 2D Navier-Stokes system is one of the major open problems in the field. In such cases, only non-smooth (Holder continuous) IFs are constructed in general, and it was unclear for a long time whether this loss of smoothness is just a drawback of the method or it has a principal significance. The situation has changed now due to our recent counterexamples which show that, in the absence of an IM, the dynamics may demonstrate features which cannot be observed in smooth ODEs, i.e. the dynamics may only &amp;quot;pretend&amp;quot; to be finite-dimensional (due to the existence of a non-smooth IF), while the &amp;quot;true nature&amp;quot; of the dynamics is infinite-dimensional. In the project we intend to give a precise meaning to this idea and investigate the effect in detail.

This will potentially lead to an essential shift in the paradigm which would requires a comprehensive study of the new infinite-dimensional phenomena arising in problems which were previously thought to be 
finite-dimensional; this is the ultimate aim of the proposed project. We intend to act in two directions: on one hand, we develop new methods of verifying the existence of IMs and, on the other hand, by combining the methods of the Analysis of PDEs and Functional Analysis with Dynamical Systems theory and, in particular, normal hyperbolicity theory and the theory of homolcinic bifurcations, we will describe a wide class of PDEs which may demonstrate the new type of infinite-dimensional dynamics. As a result, we intend to show that for systems of PDEs with a non-trivial (recurrent) dynamics there is an almost sharp dichotomy between the existence of IM and the irreducibility to a finite-dimensional system of ODEs in practically every reasonable sense. The obtained results will be applied to various classes of physically important dissipative PDEs, such as 1D Burger's type equations and systems, complex Ginzburg-Landau equations, and (as an ultimate goal) tthe 2D Navier-Stokes system on a torus or on a sphere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project connects Analysis of PDEs with modern theory of Dynamical Systems. The expected outcomes will be interesting for experts in several areas, including PDEs (new methods of constructing Inertial Manifolds, their smoothness, etc.), Functional Analysis and Spectral Theory (new counterexamples to Floquet theory in infinite dimension), Bifurcation Theory (new types of homoclinic bifurcations which lead to infinite-dimensional structures in the dynamics). Moreover, since the concepts related with the effective number of degrees of freedom and associated finite-dimensional reduction are widespread in modern science, revealing the precise meaning of such reduction may potentially have deep consequences to many areas including hydrodynamics and the theory of turbulence, weather prediction, dynamics of plasma, etc. A significant impact to numerical analysis of PDEs is also expected: explicit constructions of Inertial Manifolds of high smoothness should lead to more effective numerical schemes for simulation of dissipative PDEs, while a rigorous proof of the non-existence of an Inertial Manifold will clarify the nature of difficulties arising in numerical simulations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>384596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71E46441-9132-4F2F-8FEB-F3D799DB6E81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inertial Manifolds for the 3D Modified-Leray-$$\alpha $$a Model with Periodic Boundary Conditions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/573b537ba8bd606cfabac5dcb32540f2"><gtr:id>573b537ba8bd606cfabac5dcb32540f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kostianko A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa86ff5238234.05861223</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2CAF6870-C95F-4006-B17F-70641A523EEB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inertial manifolds for 1D reaction-diffusion-advection systems.
