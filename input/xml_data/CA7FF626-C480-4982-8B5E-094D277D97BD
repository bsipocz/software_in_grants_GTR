This symposium will focus on examining how environmental adversity influences emotional processing and the relationship between emotional processing to psychopathology or resilient outcomes. Difficulties in effectively processing emotionally valenced information and down-regulating negative emotions once they have arisen are characteristic of psychopathology and may interfere with the ability to adaptively respond to stressful experiences. This symposium will examine emotional processing in late childhood and early adolescence using an inter-disciplinary approach and specifically examine characteristic emotional processing styles associated with different forms of environmental adversity. Each paper will use a different methodological approach (functional MRI, behavioral tasks and EEG). The first paper will examine the effect of childhood maltreatment on the neural correlates of implicit emotional processing. The second will examine how emotional processing and characteristic &amp;quot;affective style&amp;quot; relate to depression in a group of adolescent offspring of depressed parents. The third will use event related brain potentials to assess responses to reward, frustration and risk taking in a group of young adolescents some of whom have experienced adverse rearing conditions. Together, these papers examine how different kinds of environmental adversity influence emotional development and lead to atypical patterns of emotional processing. They also discuss how research focusing on young people exposed to adversity can inform prevention efforts and resilience research.

The fMRI analyses of our first paradigm have shown that, in comparison to non-maltreated children, maltreated children exhibit increased amygdala and anterior insula activity when consciously processing angry faces (McCrory et al., 2011). Previous fMRI studies that scanned the brains of soldiers exposed to violent combat situations have shown the same pattern of greater activation in these two areas of the brain, which are associated with heightened threat detection and pain anticipation respectively. We suggest that both abused children and soldiers may have adapted to be hyper-vigilant to danger in their environment. However, the amygdala and anterior insula are also areas of the brain that are implicated in anxiety disorders. Neural adaptation in these regions might help explain why children exposed to family violence are at greater risk of anxiety problems later in life.

2. In our second fMRI paradigm we used an attentional bias paradigm to examine for the first time pre-attentive (i.e., non-conscious) face processing in maltreated children compared to their non-maltreated peers (McCrory et al., 2013). Maltreated children showed significantly increased neural response to pre-attentively presented angry and happy faces in the right amygdala compared to non-maltreated children. Amygdala activation to angry faces correlated with the severity of exposure to family violence in the maltreated group. This second paradigm revealed that atypical neural activation in maltreated children is not confined to threat processing but extends to the processing of positive affect. The heightened neural response to emotional facial stimuli during pre-attentive processing may reflect differences in early salience detection. We suggest that this pattern of heightened amygdala activation constitutes a latent neural risk marker associated with increased vulnerability to future psychiatric disorder.

3. The sMRI data showed that, in comparison to the non-maltreated children, maltreated children are characterized by decreased grey matter in the medial orbitofrontal and middle temporal cortices, brain regions implicated in decision-making, emotion regulation, and memory (DeBrito et al., 2012). Grey matter disturbance in these regions in a community sample of well-functioning maltreated children cannot therefore be explained by the presence of psychiatric disorder. However, these same brain areas are implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders and may represent neural markers of future risk.

Engagement with the academic community:

To date, our academic publications include one empirical paper reporting our first fMRI paradigm (McCrory et al., 2011: Current Biology), one scientific comment (McCrory &amp;amp; Viding, 2010: The Lancet), three comprehensive reviews on the neurobiology and genetics of childhood maltreatment (McCrory et al., 2010: Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry; McCrory et al., 2011: Frontiers in Child Psychiatry; McCrory et al., 2012: Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine), and one book chapter (McCrory et al., 2011: Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Wiley Publishers). The findings of our second fMRI paradigm and our sMRI data are under review. We have also presented our work at international conferences and specialist meetings in the US, Portugal and the UK. 

Engagement with Potential Research Users: 

We organised two large conferences (31st October 2009 and 28th October 2011) each with over 250 delegates, mainly social work and clinical practitioners, at UCL in collaboration with the Anna Freud Centre and the NSPCC. We have developed a collaboration with Islington Social Services and convened a free CPD event on neuroscience and resilience for all social workers in June 2010; a second event is planned for summer 2012. Further, we have organised a series of assemblies in London schools to discuss brain development and resilience and have met with an advisory group of young people in care in Islington to obtain their views on our work. In June 2012 we will be presenting findings from this project to a specialist group of MPs and policy makers as part of the ESRC Seminar Series on Developmental Social Neuroscience, Ethics and the Law. Finally, we have developed a website (www.drru-research.org) to help disseminate our work. 

Evidence of impact: 

Our 2010 JCPP review and 2011 Current Biology paper have already attracted substantial attention. The review has now been cited 43 times (as of 2/5/2012) since publication. Further, our Comment in The Lancet has attracted attention from practitioners and professionals. Our Current Biology paper was the first fMRI study of emotional processing in children exposed to familial maltreatment. It attracted substantial media interest, with an article in Times Online, in the Huffington Post, and Daily Mail and was featured in an article in the New Scientist. The PI gave several radio and television interviews, including a BBC World Service interview (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lxb9w#p00mcy9m).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>081FC55B-8E05-4B13-BBD0-AF56EF4C0FE2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cb4ee80fc09.00694823</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Child maltreatment continues to represent a major societal problem. Maltreatment is a well established risk factor for a range of problems later in life, including depression and anxiety. Yet we know relatively little about how maltreatment can impact brain development in ways that may increase a child's later vulnerability or resilience. 



In our research we investigated how the experience of maltreatment may have influenced how children process emotion. We recruited children between the ages of 10 and 14 years of age, including a group of children who had experienced maltreatment at home and a group of matched peers. We used functional (fMRI) and structural (sMRI) magnetic resonance imaging, and other measures to investigate brain function and structure. Our findings demonstrated that when processing threat cues, maltreated children show significantly increased activation in brain regions implicated in pain anticipation and anxiety disorders. Indeed, these same regions show increased response to threat in soldiers exposed to combat. In a separate task, using pre-attentively presented stimuli, we found heightened neural responses in the amygdala in the maltreated sample, suggesting profound differences in how emotional stimuli are processed - even outside of conscious awareness. 



When we looked at brain structure, maltreated children showed decreased brain volume in brain regions that play a key role in decision-making and memory. These findings demonstrate that maltreatment is likely to alter how children's brains process emotion. Our evidence points to a pattern of changes that may increase a child's vulnerability to later depression and anxiety. 



We are continuing to analyse our data in relation to resilience, and hope that this work will inform better approaches to interventions. Specifically, we are working to identify neural markers of resilience in those children who have experienced maltreatment but appear to be functioning normally, despite their early adverse experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Children's charities including a variety of voluntary sector organisations have a direct interest in establishing a better understanding of the multi-dimensional impact of child maltreatment. This work will help support their case for intervention for children who have experienced maltreatment and early adversity. Many of these charities lobby government to increase provision for children in need, particular those who experience abuse. This work also provides additional evidence of the impact of maltreatment relevant to increasing public and media awareness of this societal problem. It also provides an important source of new evidence for frontline practitioners. 



Policy makers including the Department of Children, Schools and Families, The Department of Health, and the Department of Justice will have a direct interest in the focus of the current research. Findings from the proposed study will be well placed to inform future policy and government priorities in relation to interventions for children who have experienced or are at risk from maltreatment.



Carers, including those adults who look after children who have had experienced maltreatment (including parents, foster carers and adoptive parents, as well as kinship carers) often find it a challenging experience to understand and manage their child's emotional and behavioural problems. A fuller understanding of the links between adversity and emotional development may help contextualise some of these difficulties, making them easier to manage. 



Ultimately the primary beneficiaries should be those who have experienced abuse. This will be realised by achieving impact in relation to the above. In addition, however, adults with prior childhood histories can be helped to better contextualise the impact of their early adverse experiences. This research provides some of the first functional imaging data of children exposed to maltreatment at home. Clinicians and practitioners who work with children, adolescents and with adults who have a history of maltreatment have a direct interest in this work. Relevant professions include social workers, health visitors, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists. In the short to medium term our research will help inform a clinical model of how maltreatment influences emotional brain systems and its link to increased vulnerability to psychological and behavioural problems. For example, our finding of greater neural response to threat cures in maltreated children is consistent with observations of greater hypervigilence to environmental threat that may compromise everyday functioning and academic performance. 



In the longer-term we hope that gains from this project will contribute to improved clinical assessment of emotional disturbance, better clinical guidelines in meeting the needs of children experiencing maltreatment (including systemic intervention), and more effective individual interventions with those children most at risk for long term psychiatric problems following maltreatment. One future goal is to follow a similar group of children in a longitudinal design in order to determine whether these neural markers associated with maltreatment represent prodromal markers of psychiatric risk. From a practical perspective, this would increase the case for intervention for a subset of children before psychiatric disorders become manifest.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EE8288BB-42A5-4F5E-AD1E-72067593A93B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9482960439.736917b2f0d20c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information
