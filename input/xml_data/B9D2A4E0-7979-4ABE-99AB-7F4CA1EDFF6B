The roundtable discussion engendered a lively dialogue between media practitioners, academics and the public.

This year's Festival theme was Remapping Europe and the focus was on the representation of migrants in the media and their memories in transit.
The encounter brought together artists, social activists, journalists and academics who, in a series of creative performances, working sessions and public conversations, explored three themes. The first day of the encounter was devoted to Hacking the Veil through challenging dominant media representations of immigrants.
Daniela Berghahn acted as Teller, conveying the main findings of collaborative working sessions on Day 1 to the general public of the ZEMOS 98 Festival. One of the key issues explored with regard to Hacking the Veil was how we can challenge and deconstruct images of immigrants in dominant media discourse.

The screening was advertised to the general public even though the venue was not a commercial cinema. Suri's documentary is a chronicle of immigration in Britain, from the 1960s to the present day, as seen through the eyes of the filmmaker's own family and her father's movie camera. Sandhya Suri was able to use an extensive archive of cine letters and tape recordings, which her father Yash Pal Suri, a surgeon based in Britain, and her uncle, based in Meerut, India, exchanged over a period of forty odd years. Conference delegates appreciated the opportunity to discuss this intensely personal film with the filmmaker in a Q&amp;amp;A after the screening. Since the film was not widely released in the UK, for many delegates the screening at SOAS's Khalili Lecture Theatre was a genuine discovery of a very important diasporic family film. As one conference delegate commented, &amp;quot;I felt it was extremely important to have a first-hand illustration of a real diasporic family and their experiences. The documentary certainly confirmed the issues raised throughout the conference and supported the idea of the idea that diasporic family films have universal appeal.&amp;quot;

Audience discussion suggested that there were changes in perception of immigrant families and their perceived 'otherness'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4589952448.9324090bd8d9a4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.farflungfamilies.net/events/item/the_diasporic_family_in_cinema</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture and Q&amp;A at British Museum, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A473F78E-3139-4ED2-BF04-A8954DD1D14A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In conjunction with the major exhibition 'Germany: Memories of a Nation', the British Museum screened a series of significant German films.

The public symposium was organised by the WDR (West German Broadcasting Corporation) and held at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne. Berghahn was also interviewed for a documentary on the topic, broadcast by the WDR on 31 October 2009, watched by 90,000 viewers. The event, which was accompanied by a film season (Heimat Feelings) broadcast by the WDR between October and November 2009, was initiated by the WDR's Commissioner for Integration and Cultural Diversity and the Head of Television Drama and Film. It brought together filmmakers, journalists, film critics, policy makers and international film scholars and promoted a new concept of Heimat, identity and belonging, thereby supporting the WDR's mission to promote cultural diversity and integration. As Berghahn's research demonstrates, Heimat may be a German word but in the age of transnational migration, it has gained new meanings for the transnationally mobile citizens of plural worlds. 
The symposium and TV documentary encouraged the public to re-think the concept of Heimat, conceiving of it in terms of integration.

Changes in attitude are difficult to measure, but I am sure that the TV documentary, which was accompanied by a series of feature films about immigration, had a positive impact on Germans' perception of Heimat in relation to multiculturalism.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a64b461d407.24472334</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC devoted a two-page case study to the second conference organised by the Network in Podium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6184AB3E-B161-4AC7-9B68-B0CFA1DAA564</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(Autumn 2007, no. 7, pp. 10-11)

Yasemin Samdereli, 2011) at the Cin&amp;eacute; Lumi&amp;egrave;re in London. 

Abstract: Almanya - Welcome to Germany reconfigures earlier cinematic accounts of Turkish German migration and diaspora. It is the first cinematic representation of a Turkish German family spanning three generations. Whereas earlier diasporic family films, including Solino or The April Children focus on the first and second generations, Almanya, as well as the Maghrebi French Couscous, portray a three-generational extended family, comfortably settled in the 'host country' and with no desire to return to their 'homeland' for good. In contrast to other films in which the Turkish migrants are 'othered' on account of their different cultural values, language and religion, in Almanya, the Germans are 'the other'. The film's innovative aesthetics is achieved by a clever juxtaposition of archival footage, which conveys a sense of documentary realism and, by implication, historical authenticity, and magical realist sequences whose visual exuberance is in keeping with the vivid imagination the little boy Cenk, from whose point of view the story is told. In his flights of fancy the mundane and the difficult aspects of the migrant experience are commingled with the improbable and fantastic.

Two school classes completed questionnaires about the film and Q&amp;amp;A with filmmakers and described how it affected their perception of immigrants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3719419328.2345490c162822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.farflungfamilies.net/podcasts/item/families_in_motion_migration_with_a_touch_of_magic</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures UK), That's a World Music Film for Us @ The Industrial Context of Migrant and Diasporic Cinema</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21992E58-D1B8-4629-B8B0-70E855DDAB5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Eve Gabereau, one of the managing directors of the UK film distribution company Soda Pictures, explained in an interview with Dominique Nasta that the scholarly classification of 'migrant and diasporic cinema' has little relevance in the distribution sector, where such films are classified as 'World Music films' or 'World Cinema'.

It has also inspired one of the Network members (filmmaker/producer Gareth Jones) to launch an audio-visual development programme, BABYLON, which has, in turn, supported film projects of ethnic minority filmmakers with a migratory background. Between 2007 and 2013, BABYLON provided workshop-based training for over one hundred filmmakers. Eight BABYLON alumni have succeeded in getting their films into production and theatrical distribution in the UK, continental Europe and further afield as well as winning awards on the international festival circuit.
These eight films have been released in cinemas and some have received extensive press coverage in leading newspapers such as The Guardian, Le Monde, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Zeit and the trade press (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Sight and Sound etc.). Son of Babylon was Iraq's nomination for the Academy Awards in 2010 and was distributed in nine territories. Kuma premiered at the International Berlin Film Festival in 2012 and has since been released in cinemas in eight countries including Austria, Germany, Spain, the UK and France, where it was distributed with 60 prints under the title Une seconde femme, attracting 36,710 viewers.
In addition to providing the initial stimulus for the foundation of BABYLON, the Network has created numerous opportunities for knowledge exchange, consultancy and collaboration with high-profile minority filmmakers including John Akomfrah, Abdelkrim Bahloul, Feo Aladag, diversity consultant Parminder Vir, OBE, Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures), producers Leslee Udwin (East is East and West is West) and Ralph Schwingel (Fatih Akin's Head-On) and Thierry Lenouvel (Cin&amp;eacute; Sud Promotion). These have generated a more comprehensive understanding of diversity and equality issues amongst stakeholders in the media industry. Furthermore, at the International BFI London Film Festivals in 2011 and 2012, Jones convened industry panels entitled 'BABYLON Burning - a public debate on film diversity' and 'BABYLON Breakthrough'. A productive dialogue between Nadine Marsh-Edwards (producer, board member Film London), Nadia Denton (Black Film Magazine), Leslee Udwin, David Thomson (former Head of BBC Films, now Origin Pictures) amongst others ensued at these important forums. The PI, Daniela Berghahn, participated in the industry panel 'BABYLON Burning' in 2011, which received press coverage in BritFlicks. 
Berghahn designed a public-facing interactive website www.migrantcinema.net. Between March 2006 and November 2014, it has attracted 55,540 unique visitors with a total number of 154,692 page view. The website has raised the public visibility of the research and, as a result, the PI and Network participant Carrie Tarr were invited in October 2009 to contribute to an international symposium and a German television programme entitled 'Suddenly so much Heimat: Changing Identity in Film, Culture and Society'. The public symposium was organised by the WDR (West German Broadcasting Corporation) and held at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne. Berghahn was also interviewed for a documentary on the topic, broadcast by the WDR on 31 October 2009, watched by 90,000 viewers. The event and TV programme were initiated by the WDR's Commissioner for Integration and Cultural Diversity and the Head of Television Drama and Film. It brought together filmmakers, journalists, film critics, policy makers and international film scholars and promoted a new concept of Heimat, identity and belonging, thereby supporting the WDR's mission to promote cultural diversity and integration.
In 2014, the PI and Network member Sarita Malik were invited to contribute to the 16th ZEMOS98 Festival in Seville. The Festival under the theme Remapping Europe brought together artists, NGOs, activists, journalists and a few academics. It was devoted to immigration in European societies and was funded by the European Cultural Foundation. Berghahn was subsequently invited to serve on the nomination panel for the ECF Princess Margriet Award. This annual Award is given to European artists and thinkers whose work shows the potential of culture in creating an inclusive Europe. 
In the REF2020, Berghahn's impact case study 'Representing Migration and Cultural Diversity in European Film(making)' was particularly commended by the REF sub-panel and was rated 4*.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D3539C3-2E47-4BFD-9219-82454CCFA1C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545911a7507621.18184279</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC Research Network 'Migrant and Diasporic Cinema in Contemporary Europe' consisted of eight researchers and one media practitioner who - in consultation with filmmakers, producers, distributors, policy makers and festival organisers - explored the evolution of migrant and diasporic cinemas in contemporary Europe over the thirty years. The Network has been concerned with how films made by migrant and diasporic filmmakers as well as productions which represent migratory or diasporic experiences have shaped and modified our understanding of European identity/ies, previously constructed and narrated within distinct national cinemas. The Network worked on the premise that multicultural and multiethnic presences and themes in contemporary European cinemas should not be studied in terms of their national specificity, because such critical paradigms do not adequately address the shift from the national to the transnational which has occurred since the early to mid-1980s. This shift has been fuelled by the long legacy of colonialism, the ongoing process of European integration, the geopolitical changes after the collapse of communism and the continuing influx of migrants to what is still perceived as the politically and economically stable heartland of Europe. Migrant and diasporic cinema in Europe, therefore, potentially refers to a multitude of social and ethnic groups, movements and histories, cultural heritages and practices. The Network endeavoured to establish a theoretical framework by analysing the new concept of 'migrant and diasporic cinema' in relation to the socio-political implications of existing terminology (including in languages other than English). Our attempt to locate migrant and diasporic cinema in relation to discourses of postcolonialism, globalisation, etc. as well as to current debates in film studies enabled us to identify the specificities of this 'cinema of dual occupancy', which make it distinct from other types of transnational cinema such as 'global Hollywood' or 'Europuddings'. We argue that the emergence of migrant and diasporic cinema has played a crucial role in the 'World Cinema turn' that has taken place in European cinema, both in academia and in the industry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Network has undertaken pioneering research on migrant and diasporic cinema and numerous other books, articles and doctoral theses make reference to the research findings of this project.
