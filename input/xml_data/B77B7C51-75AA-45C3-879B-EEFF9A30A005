This causes a problem for researchers, because those choices are unlikely to be random. This means it is difficult to disentangle whether children's exam results are higher in some schools than others because those schools attract higher attaining pupils, or because they are able to push their pupils to achieve better results. The latter would indicate higher school effectiveness, while the former would not.

University Technical Colleges (UTCs) are a recent addition to the landscape of secondary education in England. They are schools which operate in partnership with universities and local industry to provide high quality technical education to young people aged 14-18, aimed at &amp;quot;developing the engineers, scientists and technicians of the future&amp;quot;. 

The aim of our project is to understand how successful this model is at achieving its aims. In particular, we plan to compare the outcomes of pupils attending UTCs with the outcomes of pupils who do not in order to understand whether UTCs help their pupils to achieve more qualifications and/or higher grades, and whether they are more likely to encourage their pupils to follow pathways to careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering or maths) occupations.

The challenge here is that the pupils who attend UTCs are unlikely to be a random subset of all secondary school pupils in England. They may be more interested in STEM subjects anyway, for example, so we would not necessarily want to attribute a higher likelihood of studying STEM subjects at university amongst pupils who previously attended a UTC to the UTC itself, unless we were convinced that we were comparing pupils at UTCs with pupils at other schools with the same underlying propensity to choose STEM subjects (i.e. the same level of interest in science, technology, engineering or maths).

To find pupils like this, we will compare students with similar backgrounds - particularly in terms of their prior attainment in science and maths - in areas that do and do not have access to UTCs. This way, we can compare pupils who appear similarly well equipped to undertake a technical education, some of whom had access to a school who could provide this and some of whom did not, to see whether those who attended UTCs have better outcomes in any way.

As well as understanding the benefits of UTCs for pupils, we will also explore the benefits for their sponsors and for the communities in which they are based, to shed new light on the role these institutions may play in improving local and national economic growth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that the results of this study will be valuable to current and prospective students and their parents, the sponsors of current or prospective UTCs, head teachers of current UTCs, representatives from local authorities and the Department for Education. We describe the project beneficiaries in more detail below:

1. Policymakers:
Our findings will provide guidance to policymakers on the performance and effectiveness of UTCs relative to traditional secondary schools. This will be valuable to key stakeholders such as the Department for Education and representatives from local authorities. We will also provide new insights into the benefits of UTCs for their local economies, which will be of interest to local authorities and other local business organisations.

2. University Technical Colleges (UTCs): 
UTCs will be amongst the main beneficiaries of our research. We will work in partnership with WMG (a local UTC sponsor) and other UTC sponsors to better understand their aims and objectives, in order to learn what could be done better/differently to ensure they are as successful as possible at meeting those aims. We also expect that the results from the research would be beneficial to head teachers and other staff working at current UTCs, who may be able to identify and address areas for improvement, if they are informed of the outcomes of the study. 

3. Public:
Current and prospective students and parents may benefit from new evidence on the performance of UTCs and may gain a better insight into the benefits of attending UTCs. Students and the public will be directly informed about our research via social media, print and other media. 

Communication and Engagement:
The proposed mentors, Professor Naylor and Dr. Crawford, have ample experience with diverse pathways to impact and will, together with the fellow, ensure that the findings reach industry partners, policymakers, and of course UTCs. Warwick's unique link with the two WMG Academies and their umbrella organisation (utcolleges.org) provides an excellent opportunity for dissemination to the UTC sector. CAGE has also developed a successful model of impact activities with policymakers and other stakeholders. For example, we regularly invite groups of Whitehall employees or the Government Economic Service (GES) for tailor-made workshops at Warwick. We also hold policy briefings in London, in partnership with the Social Market Foundation (SMF), and produce policy briefing papers that are short versions of high-profile policy-relevant research. The fellow will thus have ample support to generate impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>262477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/S001751/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
