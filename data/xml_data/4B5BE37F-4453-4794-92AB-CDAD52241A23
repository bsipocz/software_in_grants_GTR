The MACACO project proposes an innovative solution to this problem by focusing on data offloading mechanisms that take advantage of context and content information. Our intuition is that if it is possible to extract and forecast the behaviour of mobile network users in the three dimensional space of time, location and interest (i.e. 'what', 'when' and 'where' users are pulling data from the network), it is possible to derive efficient data offloading protocols. Such protocols would pre-fetch the identified data and cache them at the network edge at an earlier time, preferably when the mobile network is less congested, or offers better quality of service. Caching can be done directly at the mobile terminals, as well as at the edge nodes of the network (e.g., femtocells or wireless access points). 

Building on previous research efforts in the fields of social wireless networking, opportunistic communications and content networking, MACACO will address several issues in this space. The first one is to derive appropriate models for the correlation between user interests and their mobility. Lots of studies have characterised mobile nodes mobility based on real world data traces, but knowledge about the interactions with user interests in this context is still missing. To fill this gap, MACACO proposes to acquire real world data sets to model mobile node behaviour in the aforementioned three-dimensional space. The second issue addressed is the derivation of efficient data-offloading algorithms leveraging the large-scale data traces and corresponding models. Firstly, simple and efficient prediction algorithms will be derived to forecast the node's mobility and interests. Then, MACACO will provide data pre-fetching mechanisms that both improves the perceived quality of service of the mobile user and
noticeably offloads peak bandwidth demands at the cellular network. A proof of concept will be exhibited though a federated testbed located in France, Switzerland and in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The MACACO project is totally aligned with the expected types of impact of the second topic of the CHIST-ERA 2012 call. If successful, MACACO will foster new &amp;quot;services enabling the emergence of innovative network technologies&amp;quot; by providing the required context- and content-aware models and protocols to manage the increased data usage required by the new wave of smartphones applications. By doing so, MACACO aims to reinforce the European scientific excellence in the mobile service provision and helping European carriers to offload their cellular traffic.

Additionally, by detecting and modelling the correlations between user mobility and the traffic demand he/she generates, MACACO aims to strengthen the research field of mobile networks and human behaviour prediction and &amp;quot;develop a deeper fundamental and comprehensive understanding of new enhanced communication network architectures&amp;quot;. Moreover, by facilitating development of new context- and content-aware applications, the project expects to foster significant innovation for industry. Novel and improved services will also have a significant for final users, given the fundamental role played by mobile Internet nowadays. In fact, several companies (from small start-ups to corporations) can benefit from improved wireless broadband services and from innovative content delivery mechanisms.

As also required by the call goals, MACACO &amp;quot;brings together researchers and research communities working on distinct network layers and on content and context extraction in the broader framework of a content- and context-adaptive communication networks&amp;quot;. As stated before, the consortium was carefully constituted to gather partners that are pretty complementary and qualified to address the context-content correlation and related data offloading challenge. This constitutes one of the strengths of the project, which could not be conducted with the participation of only one or few of the involved partners. Thus, in addition to the technological impact, MACACO will have a significant impact in terms of competence building. The partners will combine research and experience in a wide set of areas to gain unique competence, which will be brought forward to other European partners through the dissemination and exploitation activities of the consortium.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263814</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>12000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society International Travel Funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7589F730-E85F-4FC1-B53F-FAA4233419E6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c576d22d5892.28613701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This grant is still ongoing, therefore it is difficult to assess its overall impact at this stage.

Finding new ways to manage the increased data usage and to improve the level of service required by the new wave of smartphones applications is an essential issue. MACACO project (https://macaco.inria.fr/) proposes an innovative solution to this problem by focusing on data offloading mechanisms that take advantage of context and content information. Our intuition is that if it is possible to extract and forecast the behaviour of mobile network users in the three-dimensional space of time, location and interest (i.e. 'what', 'when' and 'where' users are pulling data from the network), it is possible to derive efficient data offloading protocols. Such protocols would pre-fetch the identified data and cache it at the network edge at an earlier time, preferably when the mobile network is less charged, or offers better quality of service. For that, we need to understand the relationship between human context (such as the his/her environment and actions) and their generated data traffic.

The preliminary results of these analysis have allowed us inferring the best times and places to transfer content from/to users' phones location and/or from/to the wireless infrastructure closest to the users' phones location. Other research activities were performed and consisted in the: energy and storage optimization of the application implementation; energy consumption analysis of different modules of the MACACOApp; modelling, characterization and/or improvement (in terms of accuracy and temporal coverage) of cellular traces describing mobility and content demands of subscribers; spatiotemporal predictability of data traffic consumption of subscribers; profiling of users' interest in applications and web content dictating pre-fetching decisions at smartphone devices; profiling of users' context in terms of wireless connectivity dictating temporal pre-fetching decisions, i.e., when to bring content to smartphone devices; defining content transport strategies in urban environments using public transportation buses.

In particular, UCL developed a series of mechanisms for receiving the right information at the right time. In particular UCL focused on the study of mobile notifications and the analysis of user-interest. Indeed, Mobile notifications provide an effortless way to enable users to be aware of newly available information in quasi real- time. However, notifications arrive at inappropriate moments or carry irrelevant content. We analysed the impact of content on the acceptance of mobile notifications. The results of the analysis were used to develop a novel machine learning approach that predicts the acceptance of a notification by using its content and the context in which it is delivered. Such an approach can be used by an interruptibility management system to ensure that the right information is delivered at the right time. We collected notifications &amp;quot;in-the-wild&amp;quot; and classified them according to the information contained in them. Our results show that a user's activity can impact the time delay in the response to a notification. We evaluated the average percentage of the notifications that are accepted in a day for each notification category. Our results show that the chat notifications, where the sender is a family member or a relative of the user, have the highest acceptance rate. Our approach outperforms the user-defined rules for delivering notifications on their mobile phones. Finally, we implement an online predictor in order to understand the required training period for successful prediction We consider this work an initial step towards the implementation of an effective and efficient component for notification management for delivering the right information at the right time. This is a key mechanism for content-centric networking. We believe that the accuracy of the prediction model will increase by considering fine-grained categories that can be obtained by classifying the notification content using natural language processing techniques. This is particularly important for intelligent pre-fetching. Another orthogonal issue that will play a fundamental role in the development of these technology is privacy: indeed, the implementation of the proposed algorithms involve the analysis of user-generated content and of the social relationships of the users. Our goal is to explore ways for performing advanced processing on the phones in order to minimize the sharing of personal information with third-party entities. 

We also worked on the automatic extraction of rules for intelligent notification management through an application called PrefMiner. The goal is to make notifications intelligible to users. We evaluated our proposed mechanism with a large-scale dataset of notifications collected during an interruptibility study. Our results show that by using the notification title and the user's location, we can predict if a message will be dismissed by a user with a very high precision. Through an in-the-wild deployment, we showed that PrefMiner represents a very effective, yet transparent, solution for interruptibility management for mobile devices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of our work have a wide applicability in a variety of areas of mobile systems design.

We plan to release libraries for automatic notification delivery and learning of rules that are able to understand users' behavior from their application usage and their context. This work is currently under way.

The work has been (and will be) widely disseminated through conferences (such as UbiComp, the leading international conference in Ubiquitous Computing).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B6DAE29D-2EE8-4A76-AF1C-196759806CBE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c59773e79066.91296081</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://macaco.inria.fr</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Quick Launch is a predictive lock screen for a quick access of apps.
