Problems are often but not exclusively associated with unvarnished, unprotected surfaces. Phenomena increasingly observed include the formation of vulnerable surface 'skins' of medium on paint surfaces, efflorescence, unpredictable water and solvent sensitivity, and alarming incidences of dripping paints several years after the paintings have been completed. The current lack of understanding of the nature of change in modern manufactured oil paints means that the established empirical approach to conservation treatments such as surface cleaning are not applicable to a great number of works. In particular, commonly used systems that rely upon water as a major component cannot be applied to clean modern oil paintings. So far, few alternative methods of treatment have proven effective and as a consequence the presentation of modern oil paintings may be compromised. This project aims at making a significant impact on our understanding of the reasons behind these phenomena by exploring several aspects of paint formulations (oil fraction, pigment-medium interactions, additives) and case study works of art. This will in turn facilitate the modification and development of surface cleaning systems that are more appropriate for use on the increasing numbers of unvarnished oil paintings in international and private collections. New cleaning systems will be trialed on works of art in several internationally significant public collections. This information will be disseminated via web platforms, seminars, conferences and a documentary for the general public and the cleaning systems will be introduced through continuous professional development workshops for practicing conservators, thereby offering practical solutions to conservators facing these difficult challenges.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>20th and 21st C painting collections are now of global importance, exemplified by the increasing international demand for exhibitions in museums and galleries. Modern and contemporary art represents recent history and reflects the politics and societal developments of nations and the contribution of museums and galleries to global economies is significant and remains reliant on access to works for display. Thus the conservation and preservation of art is essential to maintaining this public benefit, and the outcome of the new knowledge generated by this project will have a direct impact on public access.
While the outcomes have long term benefits to the public and private stakeholders by provision of access to modern art, the contribution of ideas and knowledge can be delivered to a wide range of audiences in a number of ways such as dissemination by publication and lectures in a range of media (print, web-based including Youtube films, public lectures, etc). In addition, the progress of research would form an integral part of education in conservation and conservation science (see Academic Beneficiaries). Through the same process novel high value tools developed as an outcome of the research will be implemented in the education of conservators, curators, and key stake holders in the public and private sectors. These concepts, research outcomes and practical solutions will be directly shared through seminars to ensure that more balanced conservation approaches can be achieved as quickly as possible. Scientific and conservation publications will be published and transferred via internet platforms including Tate Online and the GCI Modern Paints site (see Academic Beneficiaries). An international professional seminar/conference will be held at the end of the 3-year project where main findings and implications for conservation treatment and methodologies will be presented and discussed. Research content and tools will also be incorporated into professional development workshops for conservators and heritage scientists.
The key concepts and findings will be transferred to the general public through a documentary film, web forums and press releases, which will help raise awareness of the need to both conserve the physical integrity of paintings while also preserving the historical context of each work of art. The documentary film will be made to share the outcomes of the project, explaining the importance of painting collections which represent recent history in a fast changing European society. The film will show that loss of value of artworks can be avoided via good conservation and collections care practice, while also highlighting the possibility of production of more sustainable products by artists' paint manufacturers.
The research contributes to the sustainability and access to modern art for future generations, and has an impact on the quality of life of the wider public and society. CMOP will essentially generate new, research-based knowledge to promote the sustainable use and management of cultural heritage, by defining best cleaning treatment strategies for modern oil paintings, thus ensuring the preservation of the artist's message for future generations. The outcomes are of value to the interests of researchers, non-academic stakeholders and society, including artists, SMEs, heritage owners, public administrations, industry, research partners and local communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>138974</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A discussion on practice and problems (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A51B68E2-00B2-44A9-8F47-3D4213C666EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event &amp;quot;A discussion on practice and problem&amp;quot; took place as part of Cleaning Modern Oil Paints (CMOP), in collaboration with the Modern Oils Research Consortium (MORC), at Tate Britain, London on Friday 11 November 2016, 10-12am.
This gathering offered an opportunity to contribute case studies, discuss a cleaning problem or share current developments in ongoing research relevant to the surface cleaning of modern oil paints. With the help and participation of the audience, we created an environment which allowed for a lively and engaging discussion. All were welcome to simply attend but we encouraged contributions. We also introduced the audience to the CMOP project and shared recent progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c26adbdb9909.51991490</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/cleaning-modern-oil-paints</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research carried out thus far has provided unique information on 24 works of art in Tate's collection in the form of condition and technique texts, analytical reports and have been included as part of two post-graduate collaborative research projects between Tate and the Courtauld Institute of Art. The research was effectively disseminated to a wider audience in occasion of a public event organised at Tate Britain on 11 November 2016, which consisted of a series of short presentations given by the projects' members with a view to sharing progress, encouraging discussion, as well as offering a platform for conservators and other professionals to share their research, treatments or any issues relating to the care of modern oil paintings. This event also helped to widen the membership and impact of the Modern Oils Research Consortium [we page] and resulted in Tate's research collaborator The Dow Chemical Company, joining CMOP research efforts in addition to our long-standing efforts on the conservation of acrylic paints. 
A dedicated CMOP blog on Tate's website is regularly kept up-to-date. It allows us to disseminate the processes and findings of the research to audiences with only little or no knowledge on the subject. The blog is hosted under the following page: http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/cleaning-modern-oil-paints</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7999B3BE-AD5F-4293-AE6C-2981AD62390F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc118ce9e77.57857845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Recent research carried out through CMOP demonstrated that a group of water sensitive Winsor &amp;amp; Newton (W&amp;amp;N) oil paint swatches and samples removed from a series of twentieth century oil paintings all contain high levels of polar materials (molecules with oxygen incorporated into them such as alcohols and acids) caused through degradation reactions occurring over time, that contribute to the water sensitivity of the paint. Recent chemical analysis of W&amp;amp;N paint swatches also revealed the use of castor wax in water sensitive phthalocyanine green paints. 
To date, we have investigated a series of tiny paint samples removed from 24 oil paintings in Tate's collection, which is beginning to inform our understanding of how the paintings were made, how they have aged, and to identify potential preservation challenges. The study of paintings in Tate's collection has also enabled the identification of visual indicators for different classes of water sensitivity, which will aid conservators in assessing the condition of modern oil paintings. There is generally good correlation between the results of the multi-analytical survey of the Winsor and Newton paints and the water-sensitive paintings in Tate's collection. This is helping to build up a better understanding of the causes and occurrence of water sensitivity and will directly inform the preparation of test paint films for upcoming cleaning treatment evaluations, which will build on previous work carried out as part of CMOP.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will contribute to further research to be carried out by the CMOP post-doc and Tate staff, and will provide spin-off areas for further research for Courtauld post-graduate easel paintings students over the next year.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>34AFFC89-9917-4D0B-A946-EE9B94A52955</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc2cab7fae0.55103247</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/cleaning-modern-oil-paints</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A54A24B9-127F-4D83-AA62-56806FEC3F47</gtr:id><gtr:title>A molecular study of modern oil paintings: investigating the role of dicarboxylic acids in the water sensitivity of modern oil paints</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>RSC Advances</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/04b4dac5a2ebffcd1103096dfeb3d022"><gtr:id>04b4dac5a2ebffcd1103096dfeb3d022</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Banti D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a81b0e48e44a9.57305651</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N50435X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
