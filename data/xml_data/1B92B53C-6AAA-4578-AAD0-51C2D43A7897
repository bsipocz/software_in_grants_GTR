Yet the links between&amp;nbsp; agricultural productivity and non-farm employment are poorly understood. Recent debates indicate that the multipliers that can support non-farm rural employment depend not only on growth in local aggregate demand, but also on the spatial and institutional configuration of the links between farm and non-farm employment, and between near and distant markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will explore the spatial and institutional articulation of markets, human settlements and farm and non-farm livelihoods in marginalised and impoverished regions of Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It will do this by building a careful qualitative picture of the flow and distribution of money, resources, risk and opportunities in socio-economic networks, value chains and markets in rural districts.&amp;nbsp; This qualitative picture will be combined with a detailed quantitative analysis of the livelihood outcomes for actors and role players in the network.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will be undertaken by a consortium of researchers led by the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa.&amp;nbsp; Ethical Clearance will fall under the auspices of UWC.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most important groups to be impacted by the research includes (1) rural people who are at risk of being displaced off land and out of agriculture by inappropriately designed policies or agriculture investment models, and (2) other groups, already landless or outside agriculture, who would benefit from more inclusive approaches to growth. By promoting more inclusive and appropriate models, we aim to prevent or ameliorate such impacts, and to promote their wellbeing through inclusive and employment-intensive growth.

We will seek to achieve these aims primarily by engaging with the models and approaches of policymakers and planners. By highlighting the differential impacts on non-farm employment of different agricultural development paths, we aim to put broad-based and employment-rich growth at the centre of the agricultural development agenda. At the same time, we seek to contribute concretely by highlighting the central role of the spatial organization of linkages, networks and institutions, and by helping policymakers to identify guidelines that can promote employment-rich growth in rural areas 

The study will be particularly useful to three groups of end-users. Firstly there are those charged with developing an overarching and integrated understanding of the issues involved in supporting inclusive economic growth in general. This includes include policymakers in relevant line departments (Agriculture, Rural Development and Land Reform), but also in in other ministries with central macroeconomic planning responsibilities, or policymakers in regional structures such as SADC and those implementing CAADP in NEPAD. All these groups need information that helps them to understand the differences between different spatial architectures of regional integration and the different relationships between agriculture, markets, and employment opportunities that result. These users will be a key target of our work, and will be addressed through policy briefs, research reports, and workshops as outlined in our plan of Activities and Outputs.

Secondly there are officials engaged with the realities of implementation and economic development at local and district level, and who need practical approaches. They need to develop an understanding of practical issues involved in spatial planning for inclusive growth; often they also need support in engaging with competing and complex 'integrated plans' emanating from different line ministries. These groups are not a direct target because they are better reached through in-depth training programmes than through overarching policy guidelines. We plan to design such short courses at a later stage, but this will not be part of the present project. However, they will be consulted in the design phase of the project to include their concerns. 

The third group consists of those who operate in the public realm and who to engage in public debate and democratic policy formulation on desirable directions for healthy economic policy and rural development. This includes, for example, advocacy organizations, interest groups representing small enterprises, farmers and the informally employed. We will address their needs through ensuring that research findings are accessibly disseminated in public media, including electronic and web-based media.

We will engage with all these groups throughout the course of the project: they will be invited to make inputs during the methodological and design phases; their interest will be kept 'warm' through the dissemination of emergent issues and interesting case studies; their views will be engaged in a midterm 'emergent findings' workshop; and at the end of the project they will be targeted in a wide ranging dissemination process that will be focussed both on national policy processes and on international policy frameworks (e.g. CAADP and NEPAD). All in all, some 13% of the project budget is dedicated towards end-user engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>410953</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This film is part of a series emerging from a research project looking at the relationships between space, markets, employment and agricultural development in southern Africa.

Reflections included the need to (and constraints on) supporting smaller scale farmers, in order to growth the rural non farm economy. There was a clearly articulated request for copies of the presentations and details of the on-line versions of the policy briefs, by participants as resources for further engagement in their organizations and governments. Finally, several of the civil society participants readily made the connection between the trajectory of land commercialization in their country contexts, and critical questions around the prospects for inclusive agricultural growth and development.

These have activities have been concerned with prioritising key policy questions, advancing conceptual understandings, connecting with relevant constituencies, responding to strategic opportunities and engaging in a small number of selected capacity-building activities. 

These engagements have primary focused on one of two very different domains. 

(1) The first domain is located within the three respective national contexts (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi). In these, face-to-face engagements and textual dissemination have been undertaken in ways that have spoken directly to decision makers concerned with particular national policy questions. On a few other occasions, inputs been directed at members of regional organisations and of bilateral funding and development agencies, typically based within one of the three national country contexts. 

(2) The second broad approach by which impact has been sought is via a range of web-based outputs (reports, policy briefs, blogs and films) directed at 'public space', and which will continue to garner interest and views in future. 

ENGAGEMENT WITH POLICY MAKERS

In the South African context, the strategy was to engage with policymakers and stakeholders early in the life of the project and to keep them engaged with updates while research continued. This was intended to ensure that an interested audience was cultivated for the dissemination of findings and results.

The engagement process thus began with an initial policy engagement workshop on 14 February 2013. This workshop was intended to 'sell' the central policy question - the centrality of the rural non-farm economy and the role of agriculture within it - to policy makers. This workshop garnered significant interest, particularly from NGO and civil society stakeholders interested in thinking outside the silos of government departments. 

After this, stakeholders were informed of the project's progress, and were kept up to date through electronic means (mailing list and web). These updates included information about the progress of fieldwork and 'nuggets' (emergent findings from the field). During this same time, additional interlocutors were reached and impact was amplified through media outputs (including radio and TV). 

Towards the conclusion of the project the participants in the original launch workshop and additional interested groupings were invited to the project's closing dissemination event, 'Changing Countrysides in Southern Africa: Land and Agricultural Commercialisation and Rural Employment', a regional workshop hosted in Pretoria, South Africa on 17 June 2015. Participants in this final workshop included Members of the Pan African Parliament and policy makers, select members of civil society, and University-based researchers from five Southern African countries. Also present were representatives of regional and national bodies (NEPAD and the FAO), and development agencies (DFID, Belgian Technical Co-operation, GIZ etc.) concerned with aspects of rural and agricultural development. Many of the regional delegates reflected on their own country contexts and juxtaposed details with others in the group. These reflections were diverse, but included agreement on the need to support smaller scale farmers (and the constraints on this). Several of the participants also made the connection between trajectories of land commercialisation in their own country context, and critical questions foregrounded in the SMEAD project, including the prospects for inclusive agricultural growth and development. 

Beyond these dissemination events, linked to the timeline of the project itself, researchers took part in events with the aim of putting the research findings on the regional policy agenda. This included a series of engagements in Zimbabwe (2014-2015), participation in a Netherlands embassy roundtable, and informal briefings to DFID, the World Bank and USAID representatives. 

However, the project research findings speak to a number of more contextually grounded country-based concerns, and additional engagement efforts have been focused on the national level. 

Within South Africa this included engagement with civil society organisations. In October 2014, we participated in a SANI symposium on aspects of inequality and the agro-food system, and an Oxfam-organised event sharing the stage with the then General Secretary of South African's largest trade union confederation, Mr Zwelinzima Vavi. More recently we have engaged with rural social formations affiliated to the Alliance for Rural Democracy (February 2016). The latter was part of a larger workshop on the political economy of land, mining and rural democracy in South Africa, hosted in conjunction with the Rural Women's Action Research (RWAR) Programme in the Centre for Law and Society at the University of Cape Town. This event formed part of a programme of learning and community organisation meant to inform the practices of rural organisers and civil society organisations. 

In addition, SMEAD findings informed presentations and face-to-face engagement with policymakers from a number of national ministries within the South African government on the enabling platform of the Programme to Support Pro-Poor Policy Development (PSPPD), starting in 2015. The PSPPD platform was located first within the Office of the President, and more recently the Department of Performance, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME). 

Members of the SMEAD team in South Africa also sought to respond to the opportunities presented by emergent domestic priorities. An example of this is our engagement (via verbal presentations and submission of a memorandum) to South Africa's statutory Competition Commission, in terms of its inquiry into the grocery retail sector (Notice 580 of 2015, Government Gazette No. 38863) in late 2015 and early 2016. Here, SMEAD team members presented research revealing the implications of the concentration of corporate and financial power throughout the South African agro-food system. Their input noted the way in which the current structure of the agro-food system, including retail, has negative impacts on local rural economic multipliers, to the detriment of forms of inclusive or pro-poor economic growth. At the end of 2015, our focus was on the need for the Commission to expand its terms of reference. A strong argument was thus made to the Commission of the need to examine the structure of the agro-food system expansively, in order to understand both the impacts on and consequences of, concentration in the grocery retail sector. These arguments seem to have been successful, as these considerations were included in the final TOR of the Commission. We will continue to engage with the activities and the hearings of the Commission in 2016. Here, our work is being taken forward by the research and policy engagement activities of the recently established Centre of Excellence in Food Security (COE-FS) and the Southern African FoodLab (SAFL)

In Zimbabwe engagement activities included the cross-country, regional workshop already described above (viz. 'Changing Countryside in Southern Africa: Land and Agricultural Commercialisation and Rural Employment'). The Zimbabwe SMEAD team has distributed results of the research to local government, development, partners working in Zimbabwe, and to relevant national ministries including those for Agriculture; Finance and Economic Development, Economic Planning and Investment Promotion and Labour and Social Welfare. Starting in 2015, members of the SMEAD Zimbabwe team have held discussions with many of these officials. 

In addition, part of the focus of the Zimbabwe SMEAD team has included engagements related to the commodity chains and geographical regions in which the case studies were developed. For instance, at the 2015 Annual Tobacco Conference, the Zimbabwean Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development, Dr Joseph publicly lamented the lack of data on how the growth of the tobacco industry has impacted on livelihoods. Dr Sukume of the SMEAD team used this opportunity to present the report, policy briefs and film material to the attention to the minster, much to the Minister's interest. 

Most recently, in Zimbabwe, the Economics and Markets Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation is presently (early 2016) working on a CAADP stocktaking exercise of recent agricultural and rural development research and initiatives, to guide their programmes to achieve CAADP objectives. The initial draft of the highlights presented by SMEAD team members has informed this process and draws explicitly on its results. In this way, the project findings are continuing to inform ongoing research and policy interventions.

In Malawi, apart from participation by Malawian policy makers (and a member of Parliament) at 2015 SMEAD workshop mentioned above, much of the engagement has centred on the work of Prof Ephraim Chirwa and his team. His work continues to focus on aspects of agricultural development (e.g. the fertilizer subsidy), but also includes reference to the evidence about the non-farm linkages found by the SMEAD's project. Instances of the SMEAD Malawi team's engagement activities includes Prof Chirwa's inaugural professorial lecture delivered at Chancellor College, University of Malawi (in Zomba) in late 2014. Entitled 'Smallholder Agricultural Development in Malawi in the Past 50 Years: Has Public Policy Resulted in Unsuccessful Transformations' his lecture synthesised a range of research including the SMEAD-funded enquiry. The presentation garnered much interest on the part of both the general public and alumni. Many of the latter are policymakers in Government or prominent within civil society organisations. 

Finally, efforts to generate policy impact within Malawi have also been augmented by the production of hard copies and the circulation of printed policy briefs. This is a useful approach to overcome the limitations of internet penetration especially in rural areas.

PUBLIC DISSEMINATION 

In addition to direct engagement with policymakers and interested parties, the SMEAD findings have also been disseminated more widely via web-based, electronic and traditional print means. 

As of late January 2016 the SMEAD webpage hosted on PLAAS website has been visited by 1551 unique users views. Furthermore the SMEAD web-page has links elsewhere: for example, the SMEAD webpage on the Future Agricultures Consortium site was visited by 713 unique users.

The 'trailer' for a short (18 minute) film or documentary flagging many of the studies conceptual and policy questions particularly in relation to South Africa entitled 'Cultivating unemployment' had 108 views. But the documentary itself had 1317 views (increasing by approximately 150 views a month) on YouTube. The film is furthermore shared on the website of African Association of Agricultural Economics, and in the e-newsletter of the Local Economic Development Network of Africa.

Four short films, presenting and examining the findings in relation to Zimbabwe have similarly gleaned much attention. These short and accessible films, have been posted to YouTube, and tied to blog entries on 'Zimbabweland'. They include: 
1. Overview- Making Markets: Land Reform, Agriculture and New Local Economies in Zimbabwe documentary - 1296 views
2. Short Introduction - Making Markets: Land Reform, Agriculture and New Local Economies in Zimbabwe - 360 views
3. Horticulture - Making Markets: Land Reform, Agriculture and New Local Economies in Zimbabwe - 1071 views
4. Tobacco - Making Markets: Land Reform, Agriculture and New Local Economies in Zimbabwe - 1761 views
5. Beef- Making Markets: Land reform, Agriculture and New Local Economies in Zimbabwe -4505 views

Due to the limits of Internet penetration and connectivity in rural Zimbabwe (and Malawi) these web-based electronic modalities have been augmented with the distribution of 'hard copies' of various materials. In Zimbabwe 300 DVDs and 1250 booklets were distributed, the booklets are printed in both English and Shona. 

The SMEAD project has also sought to build and sustain impact through various blogs, many of which have several hundred unique visitor views, and will continue to garner interest for the foreseeable future. These include: 
1. &amp;quot;Rural economies: It's not only about farming&amp;quot; - shared 709 times; visited by 763 unique users - key search terms include: impact on the rural economy, place of agriculture in rural economy, rural economy, rural economic development in south Africa, rural economy in south Africa, south african rural economies
2. New documentaries telling promising stories about Zimbabwe land reform &amp;not;- blog shared 133 times; visited by 160 unique visitors
3. Blog: Three new films on Zimbabwe's markets after land reform, visited by 840 visitors
4. Agricultural development and the local: the case of South Africa, Local First blog. 
5. With regards to the Zimbabwe-related blogs, all of which are available on Zimbabweland blog. Disaggregating the views for individual blogs is difficult, but in 2015 alone Zimbaweland had over 55 000 views. (With 52 blogs this averages out at approximately 1000 view per blog). Moreover much of the impact of these blogs, and the largest number of views come from reposting, usually to the site www.Zimbabwesituation.com. Furthermore this content has been been picked up and reproduced within other blogs and the traditional mass media including The Chronicle, The Zimbabwean, African Arguments and others. Finally these blogs also automatically appear on the IDS site, which has a very large number of views. 

Downloads, especially from unique page visitors also enable impact for specific SMEAD project-generated texts to be quantified. These include: 
1. Policy Brief 36: Space, Markets and Employment in Agricultural Development: Malawi - Shared 6 times, 16 unique page visitors; 10 downloads
2. Policy Brief 37: Space, Markets and Employment in Agricultural Development: Zimbabwe - Shared 2 times, 43 unique visitors, 28 downloads

Supporting employment and livelihoods in the rural non-farm economy depends, not only on the extent and volume of agricultural production and the ability of farmers to profit from external markets, but also on the spatial characteristics of the forward and backward linkages to and from agriculture. Depending on the nature of these networks, agriculture can either be disconnected from the local economy (with upstream and downstream connections bypassing local entrepreneurs and exacerbating exclusion and marginalization) or connected to it in ways that maximise the positive local spin-offs of agriculture.

(2) The ability of these networks to support a diverse and resilient RNFE is connected to four high-level characteristics:

Density: Networks with large numbers of linked activities concentrated fairly close together are more likely to support the RNFE, firstly by reducing local transactions costs, and secondly through agglomeration effects.

External Connectedness: Under the right conditions, connection with metropolitan markets downstream from agriculture can benefit employment. Upstream external connection to highly concentrated input markets (e.g. seeds, agrochemicals) is however likely to lead to the leakage of income out of the RNFE. 

Local Embeddedness: The RNFE benefits where entrepreneurs, markets and arrangements are strongly socially embedded via formal and informal institutions, regulatory frameworks, cultural identities and political commitments. 

Inequality and power: The RNFE's ability to reduce vulnerability and support pathways out of poverty is affected by the extent of inequality in resource distribution and social power relations.

Strategies for a resilient and diverse RNFE should seek to promote agricultural linkages that are spatially dense, externally connected downstream, socially embedded, and not subject to elite or exclusionary capture.

(3) Many different factors shape the development of such networks. The three most important ones identified in this project were the extent of concentration and vertical integration in output markets, the scale of agriculture itself, and the terms of integration into the broader non-agricultural economy.

Large scale agriculture is relatively poor at promoting beneficial local linkages or at stimulating the RNFE. Small scale farmers are much more likely to incur production, investment or consumption expenditure locally, and therefore create forward linkages that support local entrepreneurs. But small farmers struggle to access distant markets and vertically integrated value chains.

A vital factor for the health of the RNFE is the presence in local markets of a diversity of informal sector and independent entrepreneurs. These are vital to smaller farmers and promote rich and complex forward and backward linkages.

Concentrated output markets organized through vertically integrated value chains tend to exacerbate patterns of inclusion and exclusion. But when distribution systems and marketing arrangements are appropriate, external connection with distant markets can benefit local farmers and local economies.

But market connections are not the only factor supporting the RNFE. Evidence showed the importance of other (often disregarded) distributive systems such as remittances, public sector salaries and social grants in supporting the RNFE.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings emphasise the continuing salience of pro-smallholder land reform in promoting diverse and resilient rural economies. Land reform of this nature should not be aimed primarily at linking farmers tightly to distant, formal markets. Rather, smallholder farming should be supported as part of diverse household portfolios that include non-farm activities. 

The findings highlight the importance of an inclusive retail, distribution and processing sector that provides opportunities for rural entrepreneurs. Local authorities and planners are often ambivalent about informal activity, seeking to regulate or formalize it in inappropriate ways, or creating an adverse business environment through punitive by-laws and extortionate fines. Instead, planning should enable local and informal markets through appropriate zoning and infrastructure provision.

Policymakers should note the importance of distributive systems other than trade. Remittances, household strategies that straddle urban/rural divides, and fiscal flows (public sector salaries and social grants) also are in keeping the rural economy afloat.

Competition authorities should consider the risks posed to rural economic development by the incursion of international supermarket chains. Measures need to be taken (either through strict zoning or by regulation that ensures local inclusiveness) to ensure that the spread of these chains in Africa do not harm local economies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0BDC3A27-A3EB-4F02-A76A-70C8CF7E2740</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>558bd8a47e4d83.70924807</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
