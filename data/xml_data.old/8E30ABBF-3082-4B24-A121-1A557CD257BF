This unique archive of 8000 photographs was collected by Cambridge anthropologist, Ethel John Lindgren, and her Norwegian husband and photographer, Oscar Mamen, who undertook field research between 1919-1921 in what was then northeast Manchuria. They amassed an invaluable visual record of the people, places, and inter-ethnic relations of the region during a formative period in pre-communist China history - before they were sedentarised and classified as 'ethnic minorities' by the Chinese state. More importantly, however, the photographs are also a highly personal community-record for Evenki and Orochen people living in China today, who are the direct descendants of those depicted in the photographs, and in many cases the images represent the only visual documentation of their grandparents and kin relations. Research will first be carried out on the photographs at the MAA to document their historical information, identifying locations, landscapes, social characteristics, and material culture. As the photographs depict communities when they were still fully nomadic, when subsistence hunting was permitted, clan identities were prominent, and both everyday and ritual activities were still widely practiced, documenting this will be key to better understanding the ethno-history of the region through the lens of nomadic communities, and how they embodied their cultural lifeworlds before the founding of the PRC. Next, the project will first use the photographs as tools during ethnographic fieldwork amongst contemporary Evenki and Orochen communities, identifying locations, landscapes, practices, and material objects to better understand everyday social life during this formative period in pre-communist China. We will also use the photographs as hermeneutic tools in order to prompt responses and discussions, elucidating people's experiences of more recent changes and state policies, such as sedentarisation, modernisation and economic development, environmental degradation, the impact of the logging industry and shift towards conservation, a hunting-ban, and the recent shift towards ethnic tourism and its significance for the politics of representation. The project also has an important community-based component, and by partnering with a Hong Kong-based NGO it will incorporate the collection into existing and new cultural revitalisation and community-outreach initiatives in minority villages and centres across northeast China. For example, we will use the photographs in educational programmes at local schools, language training, teaching skills such as hunting and craft production, music and dance, forest activities, as well as working with elders in documenting aspects of traditional culture to be re-developed for the new ethno-tourism industry and to help generate alternate livelihood opportunities. The project will also work alongside elders and community leaders to reconstruct un-recorded family and clan histories, develop individual biographies of minority officials, prominent shamans, and the wider communities, and assist people in identifying individuals and family members often not seen in photographic form before. Given the recent history of the photographs and their direct connection to communities today, the project has a unique opportunity to help disentangle people's actual lived-identities from state classifications, which often cut across ethnic categories through kinship, intermarriage, and shifting historical alliances. More broadly, we document the process of digital repatriation and sharing and describe their uses by community and state actors in the context of surging interest and investment in 'protecting' minority heritage and culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact of this project will be threefold: conceptual, by adding to and reframing academic debates on ethnic minorities in China; instrumental, by sharing the Lindgren Collection with Evenki and Orochen communities; and capacity building, by developing the researchers' skills across multiple scales with local communities, government, academia and an NGO in China. The project will build upon the Leverhulme-funded 'Etnos and Minzu: Histories &amp;amp; Politics of Identity Governance in Eurasia' (2009-16) between University of Aberdeen, Inner Mongolia Normal University, MAA and MIASU. The project will benefit those involved in the earlier research, who shall be included in joint publications and participation in our conference. We will also collaborate with a new initiative between MAA, MIASU, University of Oslo and the Museum of Ethnography in Osaka, which is funding a wider digitisation initiative on the history and ethnic diversity of northeast Asia. Along with academic beneficiaries, the research will benefit policy stakeholders within the UK, governmental and nongovernmental organisations in China and Russia, and interested parties from the media and the wider public. We shall build on the existing ties established during the Leverhulme project and expand the range of potential beneficiaries. This will be done by proactive contact with our network, encouraging them to contribute ideas for topics and identify further interested parties. Building awareness of the project will be through a number of events bringing academic and non-academic beneficiaries together; this will help achieve impact by informing public debate and disseminating information through various institutions known to the participants. Non-academic forums will also be used for dissemination. From the beginning we shall cultivate our existing links with media such as newspapers, radio, journals and online resources and continue to find suitable outlets for publications and interviews about our findings. Given the topicality of the research, the results shall also be presented to websites for the popularisation of science, one of whose representative has contacted the PI. We will take advantage of the Cambridge Festival of Ideas, the University's highly popular annual outreach event, to engage with members of the public. Presentations and lectures will be accompanied by a photographic exhibition illustrating the field research and of sharing the digital collection, which we plan to also display at venues in the UK and elsewhere linked to our network. MIASU will host our conference in Cambridge and we will invite a number of stakeholders from Europe and Inner Asia. It will have impact by engaging Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian scholars with expertise on ethnic minorities issues in the region. Our partnership with the National Museum of Ethnology (Beijing) and the Evenki Banner Government also helps position the project in the centre of debates surrounding Chinese academic engagement with ethnic minorities. MIASU will be an ideal location to bring together parties to debate the issues facing the region. The project will also directly impact Evenki and Orochen communities in China. We will digitally share the photographs with local communities; publish a local-language volume on the history of the Collection and incorporate people's experiences; and build an interactive website and mobile phone app presenting Evenki and Orochen engagement with the photographs, prioritising minority youth. Working with the Orochen Foundation, we will also integrate the photographs into cultural revitalisation projects and help develop new initiatives, such as incorporating the photos into educational programmes at minority schools, as visual aids in language training, teaching hunting and forest skills and craft production, and with elders in re-developing aspects of traditional culture for use in the ethno-tourism industry to create alternate livelihood opportunities for local people.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194434</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004768/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
