(ABCG2)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I002383/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Drug transporters, such as the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2), are recognized as key players in the distribution of drugs in human. The localization of this efflux pump in organs responsible for drug biotransformation and excretion gives ABCG2 an important gatekeeper function in controlling drug access to metabolizing enzymes and excretory pathways. ABCG2 is also found in cancer cells, where it mediates the extrusion of drug to the cell's exterior. In doing so, it prevents entry of anticancer drugs into cells and, hence, impairs the chemotherapeutic treatment of this life-threatening disease. In this proposal, we will study fundamental aspects of the transport mechanism of human ABCG2. In particular, we will study the previously unknown ability of ABCG2 to transport ions such as protons. We are interested to learn which ions are transported (in addition to protons, for example sodium, potassium, chloride ions), how ABCG2 transports these ions, and why? What is the relationship between ion transport and drug transport? ABCG2 is thought to be active as a dimer, which we will test by mass spectrometry, and is likely to have drug binding sites that are alternately exposed to the inside surface of the membrane (where drugs bind) and outside surface of the membrane (where drugs are released). Based on the available crystal structures of multidrug binding proteins (transporters and transcriptional regulators), we hypothesize that (i) protons and other ions might displace drugs from binding sites in ABCG2 during drug release and/or (ii) their binding might support structural changes in the two ABCG2 units and their interface, that are associated with the reorientation of the drug binding sites. Fundamental knowledge about ABCG2 activity will allow the rational development of inhibitors (also termed modulators) of this efflux pump that could be used to target drugs to specific parts of the human body, and to improve chemotherapy of cancers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The human Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that affects the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in our body due to its wide distribution at important pharmacological barriers. In addition, ABCG2 expression confers resistance on cancer cells by reducing the intracellular concentration of cytotoxic drugs to subtoxic levels. Although the clinical need for inhibitors that could modulate ABCG2 activity is emphasized in the literature, the rational development of such compounds will require further insights into the possible routes for modulation, and will require a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie ABCG2 activity. ABCG2 has been characterized in the literature as an ATP-dependent transporter which couples ATP-binding and hydrolysis to the transmembrane efflux of drugs. Surprisingly, analogous to previous observations on the bacterial ABC transporter LmrA, we found that the membrane domain of human ABCG2 in the absence of the nucleotide-binding domain (termed ABCG2-MD) is active as a secondary-active multidrug efflux transporter that, in ABCG2-MD, couples drug efflux to the uptake of protons by an electrogenic drug-proton antiport mechanism. The hybrid use of primary and secondary forms of metabolic energy by membrane transport systems is an intriguing and important concept that has been described for a number of other ATP-dependent transporters. In this project we will explore this novel fundamental property of ABCG2-MD in more detail and extend our observations to full-length ABCG2. We aim to characterize proton transport and transport of other ions by ABCG2 in electrophysiological experiments and conventional transport assays using radioligands and fluorescence spectroscopy, and identify amino acid residues in ABCG2 important for ion transport. We will assess how ion transport is integrated in the transport cycle of ABCG2, and how ion transport is linked to multidrug transport.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>ABCG2-mediated drug efflux significantly reduces the achievable levels of drugs in body compartments such as the brain, and affects our ability to treat cancers by chemotherapy. Our aim is to study the fundamental property of ABCG2 to transport small ions and to analyze the potential role of these ions in drug binding and release, and in specific steps of the transport cycle of ABCG2. Our research has clear social and economic impact as increased knowledge of the biochemical mechanism of ABCG2 will generate new avenues for modulation of its activity in a clinical setting, which will offer considerable potential for modulator development programs in pharmaceutical industries and commercial institutes. These modulators could rejuvenate anticancer drugs when tumor cells are resistant, and improve pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in our body. Dissemination to society in general will be effected via school outreach activities (the PI is active in this area through his work as a teaching fellow at Clare College, Cambridge), and via community events such as Cafe Scientifique talks, the Cambridge Science Festival, and via a publicly accessible website with a lay summary of our findings. The PI and postdoctoral worker will engage in academic dissemination through peer reviewed publications and talks at conferences and workshops, whilst wider public dissemination is more likely to be undertaken by the PI. Our project web site will be mounted by IT staff at Cambridge University and thereafter populated by material provided by the staff on the project. We will engage the print and broadcast media via the Office of Communications of Cambridge University and BBSRC Media Office with articles written by them and ourselves following a briefing session, and external release following approval by the PI. For radio and TV interviews, both Cambridge University and the BBSRC offer media appearance training. The PI has attended these to ensure maximum impact for any such events. The PI and Prof. Robinson (University of Oxford) already have a record of collaboration on the application of Mass Spectrometry on ABC transporters. Our management structure will involve frequent (fourmonthly) progress meetings to consider progress, make use of any emergent information from our own efforts or from other laboratories, and identify any action needed (e.g. contact PR company or other commercial entity), and the person to carry out the action to maximize project impact. The PI and Dr Fertig (Nanion, Munich) will collaborate on the application of electrophysiological techniques and the Port-o-patch patch clamp system in studies on ion transport by ABCG2. As the Port-o-patch equipment is mostly applied on channel proteins, the optimization of methods that involve the existing equipment for measurements on membrane transporters might broaden the market for this equipment, which could be beneficial for Nanion and perhaps for related companies in this field. The researchers at Nanion have a strong academic interest in this project, and will give staff on this project full support and access to their experience built up over the past years. Meetings will take place twice per year, whereas communication by email and telephone will occur on a weekly/monthly basis. After publication of primary research papers, methods on the use of the Port-o-patch in ABC transporter research will be made available to a broader public via 'Application notes', which can be downloaded from Nanion's website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>331418</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr Konstantinos Beis, Imperial College London</gtr:description><gtr:id>D262F52A-EFCE-4F3D-A38F-14BC7847D8BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our collaboration resulted in a publication in the Proc.

In essence, the transporter is expressed in bacterial cells, and solubilised from isolated plasma membrane vesicles. The protein is subsequently purified in detergent solution. Purified transport proteins are then incorporated in an inside-out fashion in giant unilamellar liposomes containing purified membrane lipids. These liposomes are painted over a small diamater capillary in the chip of a Nanion Port-o-patch setup. In initial studies we further optimized electrophysiological methods using the bacterial ABC exporter LmrA, which is a homologue of the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, and which has been subject of previous studies in our research group. We then applied the insights gained in the studies on the Breast cancer resistance protein.

Electrophysiological recordings were conducted with planar lipid bilayers with embedded protein. A number of factors had to be optimised before consistent and reliable recordings could be attempted: 

1. To characterise ion flux through the proteins, the lipid bilayer had to possess high uniformity and integrity so as to maintain high electrical resistance (&amp;gt;10GO) and low leak (passive ion movement through the bilayer) current. We deviced a method in which a lipid bilayer is formed by the bursting of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) across the aperture of the recording chip in the port-a-patch. These GUVs are composed of a 10:1/5:1 mixture of the artificial lipid 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) and cholesterol (dissolved in chloroform) and formed through electro-swelling of the mixture on conductive glass plates in the presence of 1M sorbitol. The vesicle prep pro was used to prepare GUVs. Although there is a base protocol included with the machine, optimisation of various factors including the frequency and amplitude of the applied current, temperature and incubation time improved the quality of the GUV and the subsequent lipid bilayer.

2. We found that protocols governing the storage and use of the solvent chloroform had to be enacted and optimised since its oxidation and oxidative damage to phospholipid acyl chains causes rearrangement of double bonds, chain shortening, and the introduction of a variety of polar groups in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The consequences of this were unstable and structurally weak bilayers that could not be used.

3. Extraction and isolation methods of the transport protein had to be adapted, and in the case of ABCG2, we found that inclusion of excess lipid during the detergent solubilisation to preclude aggregation of protein during purification.

4. Methods of reintegrating the purified protein into the lipid bilayer to allow macroscopic and single transporter currents were investigated. We found that too much integration of protein led to the breakdown of GUVs and too little resulted in an absence of current response. We were able to change several parameters such as detergent concentration, amount of protein added, incubation temperature and detergent removal to enable a successful and reproducible reconstitution protocol.

5. Several methods were used to optimise current responses from proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. These included the use of symmetric and asymmetric buffer solutions on cis and trans side of the lipid bilayers with altered ionic compositions and pH. Substrates that had previously been shown to either initiate or moderate transport were also tested to observe whether they could also initiate or modulate current flux. Additionally, the interior voltage was held at various potentials and altered in a step-wise manner or at a constant rate to investigate its influence.

6. Several data analysis packages were tried including Clampex, Patchmaster and HJCfit. However QUB was chosen as the best program for single channel analysis and Patchmaster was used for analysis of macroscopic results.

The application of the optimized method gave us fascinating and unique insights into the mechanism of ABC transporters. For LmrA, we found that ion conductance is coupled to the binding of specific nucleotides, and that the full transport cycle (ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis (ADP-vanadate trapping), ADP release) is not required. In contrast, the full cycle IS required for export of organic cytotoxic substrates (including ethidium and others). Our data are consistent with our published data that the membrane domain of LmrA (in absence of the nucleotide-binding domain) can function as a secondary-active transporter that couples the translocation of protons to that of chloride and sodium. Thus, the bacterial ABC transporter LmrA shares features with the mammalian ABC chloride channel CFTR. We are currently working on a manuscript that incorporates these exciting findings. Similar to LmrA, we also observed that the membrane domain of ABCG2 (in a truncated construct and full-length protein) can act as a secondary-active transporter, and have been able to test its activity extensively in proteoliposomes. In contrast to LmrA we observe that the ABCG2 catalyzes a drug-proton antiport mechanism. In this project, we have been able to extend these observations in cells and proteoliposomes, and are now able to describe the energetics of the transport reaction in great detail. We have a complete data set ready for the publication on ABCG2, and we are working on the manuscript that describes our findings. In collaboration with structural biologists at Imperial College London, we have also worked on a related mechanism of the ABC transporter McjD, which shares significant sequence similarity with LmrA and which contains the same glutamate that is responsible for proton coupled transport in LmrA (E309 in McjD; E314 in LmrA). The McjD crystal structure reveals a novel outward-occluded intermediate, the existence of which was predicted in our related work on the ABC exporter MsbA [Doshi and van Veen (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288(30):21638-47, and Doshi et al. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288(10):6801-13]. In this new McjD structure, E309 is part of a salt bridge between membrane helices. It is feasible that proton transport in LmrA arises from formation and disruption of salt bridges during conformational transitions, and this provides a lead for further research on these interesting proteins. Our collaborative work on McjD was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA [Choudhury et al. (2014) PNAS 111(25):9145-50]. This project has been exciting journey.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have demonstrated that electrophysiological techniques can be applied on ABC transporters, and it can be expected that once these data have been published, our methods will be applied by others in this field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6EB492BF-D380-40BB-B7A8-0919B324DE87</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54515ddd3a0eb3.05694682</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>With input from my current postdoc Dr Kelvin Agboh and based on work of an earlier postdoc Dr Saroj Velamakanni, we have established methods to measure electrical currents generated by single purified ATP-binding cassette membrane (ABC) transporters in planar bilayers.
