It subdivides into two detailed case studies, which investigate in turn the photographic legacy of the Nanjing Massacre and the Cultural Revolution. Both these episodes have struggled to find redress and commemoration, and both have latterly carved their way into public memory in part through the auspices of photography. This project investigates the notion of &amp;quot;photographic memory&amp;quot;, and it explores the use of archival stills in post-socialist China. Above all, it analyses the complex ways in which such images have been aesthetically adapted in literary, cinematic, and artistic representations of these events. 

The first section begins by tracing the energetic dissemination of stills depicting the Nanjing Massacre in recent years. It demonstrates that the primary venues for these images are dedicated albums, museums, commemorative websites, historical monographs, journal articles, popular history tomes, and textbooks; yet it also shows that these stills have long since ceased to operate within Massacre memorial alone. In particular, the project investigates the ways in which the photographic legacy of the Nanjing Massacre has infiltrated creative representation. It explores fiction, reportage, cinema, documentary, painting, and linked picture books, focussing on the work of Lu Chuan, Sun Zhaiwei, Ye Zhaoyan, Li Zijian, and Liu Zheng. It asks why photography has saturated depictions of 1937, and it analyses the ethical risks of this representational practice. 

The second case study explored here is the photographic legacy of the Cultural Revolution. A pervasive vogue for &amp;quot;sepia memories&amp;quot; of this era has come to the fore in recent years; and within this theme, formal portraiture stands out as a special topic of fascination. Once hidden away in private homes, these images now emblazon albums, periodicals, postcards, posters, and exhibitions, and their vendors ply a brisk trade in flea markets and auction houses. Just as with the Nanjing archive, portraiture from the Cultural Revolution has shifted in meaning as it migrates from private hands to the public market. These images have also pervaded creative representation, shaping fiction, essays, film, documentary, painting, sculpture, and photographic art by cultural figures such as Liu Xinwu, Jiang Wen, Hu Jie, Zhang Xiaogang, Hai Bo, Feng Mengbo, and Zhang Huan. This section of the project argues that photographic representation illuminates the fine line that separates the inalienably private quality of traumatic experience from the needs and pressures of public commemoration.

The project concludes by arguing that the Nanjing Massacre and the Cultural Revolution have each generated a photographic discourse that is unusual in both richness and reach, but which threatens to short-circuit the workings of the creative imagination. The camera may never lie; but to rely on this clich&amp;eacute; in aesthetic representation, which is supposed to negotiate hard with the very notion of &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot;, can shield both producers and their audiences from a tougher kind of reckoning with the past.

The key methodology adopted in this project is an intensive interdisciplinarity which is unusual in contemporary Chinese studies. Its baseline approach is a fusion of history and cultural studies; but within this framework, the project devises a more specific methodology that combines photography studies with literary criticism, film studies, art history, and museology. After all, the sources explored here blend archival stills with a range of creative genres, and the texts and artefacts thus produced are aesthetic crossbreeds. The ultimate aim of the methodology pursued here is to probe this notion of the creatively reconstituted image-work, and to use it as a tool for understanding how the past is managed in contemporary China.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has a number of significant outputs. The first is the monograph mentioned above, which will make this research available to various academic constituencies. The second is a conference or workshop, also referred to earlier, which will gather together scholars at differing stages of their careers to ensure that the methodologies pursued in the project can achieve greater impact and dissemination across the relevant scholarly communities. I intend to involve scholars working outside Chinese studies in this event, so as to ensure that the project gains a broader reach. I also intend to collate the papers presented at this conference in an edited volume. This kind of academic impact will be further reinforced by presenting the research findings of the project at national and international conferences; I have already given a public lecture and a conference talk on the project (at Oxford and Yale), and have further presentations in the pipeline. The third type of output will use the interdisciplinarity of the project as a springboard for launching it into the public sector. This will take the form of proposals for a series of lectures or a one-off talk which I will pitch to museums and galleries across the UK. I would also hope to take these lectures abroad, and will target public-sector institutions with a strong China focus (such as the Mus&amp;eacute;e Guimet in Paris). Along similar lines, I will seek to tap into recent enthusiasm for Chinese film by approaching the British Film Institute with a proposal for a screening of one or more recent films explored in the project, followed by a lecture with a Q&amp;amp;A session. Wherever possible, I will invite Chinese directors and artists to take part in these events. Public-sector activities such as these will help extend the impact of the project, at the same time as they promote greater awareness of China outside the conventional spheres of economics and international relations.

This project can also be of benefit to policy-mkers - including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the House of Commons International Development Committee, and the House of Lords Select Committee on China and the EU - through the insights it offers into the management of Sino-Japanese relations over the last couple of decades. The circulation of archival images from the Nanjing Massacre is crucial to the formation of Chinese public opinion on Japan, and their reproduction in state-run museums, school textbooks, and government-aligned publications sheds fresh light on the readiness of the Chinese Communist Party to stoke political tensions even as it pursues economic engagement with Japan. Meanwhile, the use of photographic portraiture from the Cultural Revolution across a range of venues highlights the struggle to &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; this particular epoch which has become so central a political battleground for several key groups in contemporary China, from the ultra-Maoists to the liberal wing. For some, the personal quality of these images represents a repudiation of the mass line, while for others they summon up a lost era of passionate ideological commitment. Either way, these images and their reconstitution in culture offer a window on the impact of China's past on its political present that has repercussions well beyond the realm of academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>British Inter-University China Centre network grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Inter-University China Centre</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>04EF69DF-DF5E-4462-92C8-F0CB9D6378A5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f606784b7e2.00079439</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has sought to explore how aesthetic representations which re-purpose well-known historical photographs from twentieth-century China help to sculpt our vision of that past. Analysing the travels that such photographs have made into literature, cinema, sculpture, painting, and digital platforms, the project shows how these hybrid forms can seed and grow consciousness of the past for contemporary spectators who often have no lived memory of the events such works depict.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project develops a methodology for interpreting cultural forms which recreate or reconstitute well-known photographs, and their impact on memory. It argues that such works - which can usefully be dubbed photo-representations - form a distinctively transmedial aesthetic category. Harnessing the properties of the photographic image, across medium and across material, they draw viewers into a densely layered, cross-textured experience of past lives: both their own and those of unknown others. The diverse texts and artefacts I have examined in this project reveal that contemporary Chinese culture offers rich materials for the analysis of photo-representation as an expanding aesthetic order. Yet striking and specific as China's photo-forms are, they belong at the same time to a global category of objects whose full taxonomy has yet to be fully charted, even as its impact on the visual landscape of the past, and on the meanings of photography itself, is intensifying. &amp;quot;China&amp;quot;, in other words, forms the aesthetic archive from which the representations here are culled; but another archive would yield a similar set of findings, and could be fruitfully explored using the methodology developed here.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB994E9F-1336-499E-B6ED-6E1C03B84E9E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54611c1c259035.88941816</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J004936/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18BE3C84-714B-4BEC-A5E9-B1F27D03EA79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asiatic &amp; Oriental Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
