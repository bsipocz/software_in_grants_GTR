Although there have been exceptions, there is increasing frustration at the limitations of learning from animal models, emphasising the importance of studying human tissue. Neuropathologists work in NHS hospitals examining samples from the brain and related tissues derived from operations (biopsies) or post mortem examinations. Their job is to identify abnormalities, make a diagnosis and try to understand how the abnormalities arise. Neuropathology has existed as a specialty in the UK for 40-50 years and, as a consequence of this work, substantial archives of diagnostically verified tissue have been established nationwide. These archives contain a wealth of tissue from a great variety of neurological conditions, including common conditions such as stroke, head injury, tumours, infections, psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders and many rare conditions, and represent an underutilised resource for research. BRAIN UK (the UK BRain Archive Information Network) networks the tissue archives of neuropathology departments based in 26 regional NHS Clinical Neuroscience Centres to form a virtual brain bank, acting as a &amp;quot;matchmaker&amp;quot; linking researchers needing tissue to the appropriate samples. Through BRAIN UK researchers can gain access to &amp;gt;400,000 samples from a wide range of diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerve, muscle and eye. BRAIN UK has ethical approval which covers the majority of projects, saving the researchers considerable time as they would otherwise have to obtain this approval independently. Over the past 4 years BRAIN UK has supported 48 research projects in many centres around the UK and overseas. In the coming 4 years we want to continue to provide tissue to researchers from existing resources and add newly obtained samples of which &amp;gt;16,000 are becoming available each year. We also aim to gather the results of researchers' studies performed on tissue obtained through BRAIN UK to form a central register of findings which will benefit new researchers wanting to perform new studies on these tissue samples. Finally, we will link BRAIN UK with UK Biobank, which has 500,000 intensively studied participants from the general population, in order to learn more about the origins of neurological disease. As far as we are aware, the BRAIN UK network is unique in the world and is very economical as it makes use of tissue samples already being stored in NHS archives which would otherwise be unused and unavailable to researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Formal prospective brain banks mainly focus on neurodegenerative disease and do not cover other common disorders such as stroke, head injury, psychiatric and developmental disorders. There already exists as a result of decades of diagnostic work a vast resource of well-characterised human tissue in NHS Clinical Neuroscience centres. BRAIN UK is a collaborative virtual brain bank, linking together 26 regional centres, covering approx. 90% of the UK population, and the Corsellis Collection, with its large collection of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Access is provided to tissue from &amp;gt;60,000 post mortem examinations and &amp;gt;400,000 samples from the living (biopsies) permitting very large studies on common disorders, and particularly useful for uncommon disorders. It allows research into the many neurological diseases not covered by dedicated brain banks. Researchers obtaining tissue through BRAIN UK do not need to obtain their own ethical approval, saving approx 6 months per project. 48 applications have been supported (2011-2014) encompassing a wide variety of conditions including stroke, epilepsy, schizophrenia, tumours, disorders of childhood and ageing. In the coming 4 years we aim to (i) continue to supply neuroscience researchers with well characterised human brain tissue samples (ii) add newly obtained tissue samples which are being accumulated at a rate of &amp;gt;16,000/year (iii) establish a system to gather together data generated by researchers on samples provided by BRAIN UK, promoting interactions and collaborations, and (iv) establish links between BRAIN UK and UK Biobank, a resource with rich data on 500,000 participants in the general population to further understanding on the origins of neurological diseases. As it makes use of existing samples BRAIN UK represents excellent value for money. The scale and scope of BRAIN UK is unprecedented and archived tissue that would otherwise be unused has supported important research projects.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following groups will benefit from BRAIN UK, in addition to the academic beneficiaries described above:

Patients - engaging patients with neurological conditions with research in relation to use of their tissue samples and the consenting process. The output of research undertaken using tissue samples provided through BRAIN UK will ultimately benefit patients with neurological conditions.

Third sector - achieving the aims of the brain tumour charity brainstrust by partnering with BRAIN UK to further research into brain tumours.

Commercial sector - provision of tissue samples to industry (e.g. GE Healthcare for the development of Multiomyx technology).

NHS regional Clinical Neuroscience services - forming the BRAIN UK network has strengthened relationships between centres, highlighted the benefits of interactions on a national scale and enabled some otherwise non-research active NHS staff to contribute to research.

UK biobank - providing access to tissue samples from UK biobank participants.

Education - BRAIN UK is particularly useful in providing access to tissue samples for small studies performed as projects by undergraduate students of science and medicine as it lowers the hurdles otherwise required to use human tissue.

Global perspective - BRAIN UK presentations at international conferences help to convey the reality that the UK leads the way in healthcare research networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294982</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N004272/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
