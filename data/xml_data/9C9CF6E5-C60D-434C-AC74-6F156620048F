Much that our culture produces does not seem to have obvious benefits in the way that technology does. Nonetheless there is a long tradition of valuing fictional stories, pictures and other &amp;quot;impractical&amp;quot; cultural products for their beauty, for their display of imaginative and other admirable skills, and for their capacity to connect us with other people in our past and present. Thinking about culture in this last way--as a transaction between people over space and time--suggests that these products may have what are sometimes called &amp;quot;cognitive&amp;quot; values, or capacities that enable us to generate and transmit the insight or understanding that goes with various forms of practical and theoretical knowledge. Are beautiful things more beautiful for conveying knowledge? Conversely, if a cultural object spreads ignorance, error and bad judgement, is it thereby less beautiful, less worthy of being called art? These questions form the background of our project.

Its aims and objectives 
The relations between cognitive and aesthetic values, and their place in our cultural practices are complex and we don't aim, in this brief and preliminary project, to fully explain them. Rather, we will bring together expert researchers from a range of disciplines who will contribute their varied and divergent perspectives on this relationship via close analysis of a few concrete cases. We have chosen these cases deliberately to go some way towards recognising that cultural artefacts come in very diverse kinds, and that their cognitive and aesthetic features are very varied. We take first one of the most ancient examples of proto-artistic activity, the animal depictions discovered at Chauvet cave in the Ard&amp;egrave;che region of southern France in 1994, some of which are reckoned to date from more than thirty thousand years ago. Our second example is a group of Shakespeare's poems in sonnet form meditating on the subject of time and mortality, while our final example brins us to very recent times and perhaps the most global current artistic form: Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner.

Its potential applications and benefits
Our project is first of all a contribution to the AHRC's large scale research initiative into the exploration of cultural value, which takes as its starting point &amp;quot;the different forms of cultural experience, such as, for instance, the aesthetic and cognitive dimensions of our cultural encounters&amp;quot;. We believe that our research will be of foundational importance for the project and that our results, preliminary though they will be, will connect with and inform the work of many other scholars working on the project. More specifically, our contribution will be to help clarify what is involved in thinking through the relations between cognitive and aesthetic values, and to illustrate how general theories in this area have application to specific and concrete cases like those we will examine. We expect also for our work to inform the thinking of those involved in the artistic and museum worlds who grapple daily with the problem of presenting cultural objects in a context which best illustrates their various forms of value. Through publications in academic journals and in cultural and artistic magazines and through appearances in the media we expect to provoke and inform debate across society on why artistic and more broadly cultural activity should be valued.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1 Beneficiaries
There are four main types of beneficiaries from this project:
 
i. Development managers from cultural organisations seeking external funding. (This will include theatres, galleries, museums and heritage sites.)
ii. Research funders and policy makers. (This will include the AHRC as well as the British Academy, Leverhulme etc.)
iii. Funders of the research councils and other funders. (This will include The Treasury)
iv. Academics from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Development Managers from Independent Research Organisations (IROs).

2 How they will benefit
Each of the above beneficiaries has a related range of problems around cultural value:
 
i. Most cultural organisations, including museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls, heritage sites etc., derive some or all of their funds from other public (and on occasions private) sector organisations. And they are required, in an increasingly competitive market, to justify why their initiative should be funded. They have a very real and urgent need to develop convincing arguments to support their applications. This is critical if they are not only to survive, but to survive with exhibitions that are not assessed on simple metrics. 
ii. Research councils and other research funders have two related problems. First they need to be able to articulate and argue convincingly the case for their own funding. Again this is becoming increasingly difficult in a climate of economic austerity when there are so many competing calls on government funds. And the second concerns understanding and evaluating the range and significance of the impact in competing proposals. 
iii. Funders of the research councils and other funding organisations need to understand and appreciate the values that the research funders are using to justify their funds.
iv. Academics and development managers from IRO's need to be able to articulate what the impact and what the benefits of the particular projects are. Not just for enhancing research project proposals, but for wider justification that helps to explain and to engage the public. 

All of the above four sectors will benefit from the project through the provision of a clearly articulated range of values based on a concrete set of cultural artefacts. Cultural organisations, HEIs and IROs will have a clearer understanding of how value can be articulated in proposals. Research funders will have a conceptual framework that will support better impact assessment of proposals and support the means for justifying their funding activities to their funders. And the Treasury will be in a better position to understand and evaluate the arguments for continuing to support research in the Arts and the Humanities. The AHRC will further benefit as the project will form a foundation for further investigation into the methodologies for capturing and evidencing these values. 

The process by which these values are being developed include a series of workshops, online workshop summaries and a final report of recommendations based upon the workshop summaries. Representatives from the above beneficiaries will be invited to participate in the workshops, and all beneficiaries will be encouraged to participate in the online debate around the workshops and the workshop summaries. This will ensure end user involvement in the process and support the development of relevant cultural values based on their perception and needs. It will also provide a route for end users to feed back into the final project report.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28471</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. A clearer understanding of what 'cognitive' and 'aesthetic' values in artefacts are: hence a contribution to a fundamental issue in aesthetics.
2. Showing how research into a fairly abstract philosophical question (the nature of different kinds of values) can be illuminated by focusing on specific case studies, and that the illumination goes both ways: hence a contribution to research methodology in the arts.
3. Significant new light shed on each of the case studies-Chauvet Cave, Shakespeare's sonnets, and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner -emerging from the unusual perspective of the framing questions: hence a contribution to art and cultural criticism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that our findings will have an impact in both academic and non-academic fields. Academics working broadly across the arts-in philosophy of art, aesthetics, paleoanthropology, literary criticism, film studies, art criticism-can draw on our detailed exploration both of the case studies themselves and the underlying questions about values. Non-academics working across the education, culture and heritage sectors should benefit from the non-technical clarity of our investigation of the different kinds of values in the arts. Cultural organisations concerned with funding and management of the arts can utilize the deeper and multiple criteria governing values in the arts as explored in our final report.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2F5ED42-40CB-4937-9F87-C64E34AFE1F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54621f71504d92.50446149</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/a/york.ac.uk/cognitive-and-aesthetic-values/front-2</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DD30BC29-03E4-4077-8BD2-B5925FE3635B</gtr:id><gtr:title>How to Make Believe - The Fictional Truths of the Representational Arts</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a883246422131f28fa45472533ddc6fa"><gtr:id>a883246422131f28fa45472533ddc6fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lamarque P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cf11d6373811.06669757</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L005719/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>613C584A-2828-41FD-B276-95CC04EA3952</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Prehistoric Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
