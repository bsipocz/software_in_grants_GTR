DECISION-MAKING UTILITY FOR DROUGHT RISK MANAGEMENT</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/L01033X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This innovative interdisciplinary project aims to develop an easy-to-use, evidence-based resource which can be used in decision-making in drought risk management. To achieve this, we will bring together information from drought science and scenario-modelling (using mathematical models to forecast the impacts of drought) with stakeholder engagement and narrative storytelling. While previous drought impact studies have often focused on using mathematical modelling, this project is very different. The project will integrate arts, humanities and social science research methods, with hydrological, meteorological, agricultural and ecological science knowledge through multi-partner collaboration. Seven case study catchments (areas linked by a common water resource) in England, Wales and Scotland will be selected to reflect the hydrological, socio-economic and cultural contrasts in the UK. Study of drought impacts will take place at different scales - from small plot experiments to local catchment scale. Citizen science and stakeholder engagement with plot experiments in urban and rural areas will be used as stimuli for conversations about drought risk and its mitigation. 
The project will: (i) investigate different stakeholder perceptions of when drought occurs and action is needed; (ii) examine how water level and temperature affect drought perception; (iii) explore the impact of policy decisions on drought management; (iv) consider water users' behaviours which lead to adverse drought impacts on people and ecosystems and; (v) evaluate water-use conflicts, synergies and trade-offs, drawing on previous drought experiences and community knowledge.

The project spans a range of sectors including water supply; health, business, agriculture/horticulture, built environment, extractive industries and ecosystem services, within 7 case-study catchments. Through a storytelling approach, scientists will exchange cutting edge science with different drought stakeholders, and these stakeholders will, in turn, exchange their knowledge. Stakeholders include those in: construction; gardeners and allotment holders; small and large businesses; local authorities; emergency planners; recreational water users; biodiversity managers; public health professionals - both physical and mental health; and local communities/public. 
The stakeholder meetings will capture various data including:
- different stakeholder perceptions of drought and its causes
- local knowledge around drought onset and strategies for mitigation (e.g. attitudes to water saving, responses to reduced water availability)
- insights into how to live with drought and increase individual/community drought resilience
- the impact of alternating floods and droughts

The information will be shared within, and between, stakeholder groups in the case-studies and beyond using social media. This information will be analysed, and integrated with drought science to develop an innovative web-based decision-making utility. These data will feedback into the drought modelling and future scenario building with a view to exploring a variety of policy options. This will help ascertain present and future water resources availability, focusing on past, present and future drought periods across N-S and W-E climatic gradients. The project will be as far as possible be 'open science' - maintaining open, real-time access to research questions, data, results, methodologies, narratives, publications and other outputs via the project website, updated as the project progresses.
Project outputs will include: the decision-making support utility incorporating science-narrative resources; hydrological models for the 7 case-study catchments; a social media web-platform to share project resources; a database of species responses/management options to mitigate drought/post-drought recovery at different scales, and management guidelines on coping with drought/water scarcity at different scales.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have high impact in theoretical, policy and practical terms in local/national/international contexts. In policy terms, drought is now one of the major risks facing the UK. The project aims to mitigate drought impacts, and through a new innovative multi-stakeholder decision-making utility, to make different stakeholders more resilient to drought risk and drought events. 
The project's impact strategy is driven and strengthened by the engaged nature of the research process. Key target groups/beneficiaries within, and beyond, those immediately engaged within the project have been identified. These include: stakeholders working at local and regional levels in different domains (health and wellbeing, urban design/built environment, agriculture/horticulture, utilities, government, business, tourism and ecosystem services) to manage the impacts of drought and water scarcity in the 7 case-study catchments; educational organisations (formal/informal); wider inter-professional groups in the UK with interests/concerns in drought risk management/mitigation of impacts, including communities and the general public.
Developing organisational stakeholders and communities that are resilient to living with drought risk and water scarcity, and resilient to future drought is of the highest priority. A multi-stakeholder shared recognition of drought risk, and a developing attitude of coping/living with flood events, are vital components of drought risk planning/resilience. This research will make a significant contribution to drought policy discourses and practices in the way it brings different stakeholder drought narratives into thinking about and developing drought resilience. 
The interdisciplinary and narrative based research methods are designed to enhance and dovetail with the impact strategy giving opportunities for new and innovative approaches to achieving impact. This integrates: how mesocosms and social media tools can engage new/different audiences, and how the inclusion of lay voices and narrative data might incentivise the policy process. Policy makers have to balance all these competing interests - so, rather than handing policymakers the science, the project supplies 'the whole data package'. For further detail on beneficiaries, benefits and methods, see the Pathways to impact document. These include:
- Project partners and stakeholders working at local and regional levels in different domains (water supply, health and wellbeing, urban design/built environment, agriculture/forestry, government, business, tourism and ecosystem services) and the policy/governance communities (Environment Agency, SEPA, National Resources Wales and local/regional/national levels)
- General public and communities (e.g. Local Resilience Forums with responsibilities for community lead adaptation planning)
- Scientists and artists working as part of different professional organisations (e.g. environmental regulators/wildlife conservation) 
- Individuals and collectives of creative practitioners and cultural activists whose work focuses on related environmental and sustainability issues 
- Educational organisations (schools, further/higher education but also less formal learning).
The case-study based research design will identify 7 catchments with a wide range of physical/socio-economic-cultural characteristics that will form a platform for wider stakeholder engagement across the UK. The project will have an integrated dissemination/impact strategy that targets different stakeholders for awareness, information and action for behaviour change. Impact will be delivered by on-going dialogue/exchange; a culture of co-production of knowledge, and working with key organisational gatekeepers/ communities in catchments and beyond. Impact strategies will include website/social media; open access research outputs for end users; participatory activities (seminars, workshops, conference) and a science-storytelling e-workbook for schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1642669</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Co-produced narrative resources (stories in different forms - including digital stories) are being built up for DRY's seven case-study catchments (Fowey, Frome , Ebbw, Pang, Bevills Leam, Don and Fife Eden).

? Since the start of 2016 eighteen citizen scientist volunteers have contributed over 160 hours of their time collecting data at the Simms Hill site in the Frome catchment.
? Citizen scientist volunteers visited several times a month during 2016, with weekly visits during the summer.
? They collected data on plant height, flowering dates and presence of pollinators, worked in the lab, helped with site maintenance and recorded their digital stories 

MSc student of UWE are carrying out research projects at the Bristol sites using the facilities of CEH. Good partnership and cooperation practice.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CEH has set up an ecological experiment at two sites in each river catchment. On each site there are 15 plots called 'mesocosms', which are used to measure the effects of drought on grassland plants and insects and will be scaled-up to generate catchment-level information.
At each site, 12 mesocosms have roofs which intercept 50% of rainfall and simulate drought. 6 have roofs which allow rain through (to monitor the influence of the frame on plant growth) and 12 have no roof or frame ('controls' which allow us to compare plant growth in the absence of drought). The experiment was set up in autumn 2015 and citizen science data collection began in February 2016.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Hospitals</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the West of England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK Droughts and Water Scarcity Work Package 4</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D4A2AE1-BBA9-4553-A190-24ADF6AC9599</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet funded, with council</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58875f0e626344.60002984-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Submitted to council</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Submitted Co-Investigator - Developing/ trialling new social networking protocols for promoting on-going inter-professional and public dialogue about drought and water scarcity.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DRY -Drought Risk and You - Stakeholder Competency Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA644385-6C75-449D-A8C2-B7EBF9FEB257</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This Stakeholder Competency Group is working with the full project team as research partners in mutual knowledge exchange.

In turn, various stakeholders were invited to tell their stories and could be questioned for clarification by either the jury or the general public, who were gathered as the audience. After all the stories were told, everyone (judge, jury, witnesses and general public) retired to enjoy a communal meal, before returning to the hall, where the jury delivered its verdict, for which the judge then provided an interpretation, one that combines vernacular wisdom with a healthy disregard for traditional power structures, to share a resolution that unites, rather than divides the community.

We present the modelling results, identifying problems and gap in our information and understanding. These often lead to a debate and most of the times, we receive feedback and extra support from the LAG. In 2016, a member of the Pang catchment LAG organized a guided tour to the gauging stations and showed where the stream flow of the Pang can be affected by the River Thames during the high flow periods. This also was followed by receiving reports on the historical flows at several gauging stations from a new member of the LAG.

As happened in Ramsey in June, we invited local groups and organisations, such as the NFU, Natural England, The Great Fen Project and Angling Trust, and general public for an evening of convivial local storytelling, food and drink. 10 storytellers shared their experiences of water management and plans for the future as climate change is a growing concern. There was the opportunity to ask questions and sharing experiences from the audience, while also learning about how Peterborough and the Fenlands can help each other in the future.
The evening of entertainment took the form of a mock court room, where members of the community shared stories about water usage, the flood/drought nexus and the future of the Fens. Involving an advisory jury made up of young people, the event was designed for all of the community.
As part of the event, we also had a communal meal, which was made with locally sourced produce.
Court-artists, a musician, a caricaturist, a poetic judge and some good food promise made this a lively and fun-filled evening of community, music, stories and laughter.

During the conference, we proposed a 'performative screening' of stories, dialogues and songs generated for and by our local stakeholders to reflect on the potential of a utopian participatory approach for decision-making.
During our public engagement activities, language has been identified as one of the main concerns, especially with regard to the impenetrable way in which policymakers and scientists often communicate. Hence we suggested multiple-narrative approaches in various languages to facilitate a utopian universal understanding: verbal/visual, factual/fictional or poetic, English/ other languages. This 'performative screening' was structured in three phases (a dialogue in two different languages, a screening of stories, the playing of a song as part of the storytelling process) to explore the potential re-use of a traditional form of performative orality from Sardinia ('La Rasgioni' or ' The Reasons') that aims to solve dilemmas and disputes within the community, by reconciling conflicting interests in a way that builds resilience and reinforces community cohesion.

On the 24th May 2016, the DRY team has invited farmers and others with interests in drought impacts on crops (including the NFU and United Kingdom irrigation Association) to visit crop experiments being undertaken at Harper Adams University. During the day, we are keen that farmers have the opportunity to share their memories, experiences and knowledge about the impacts of drought and water scarcity on their farming so that their experiential knowledge can come into play with the evidence from the scientists. 
In scene setting, Dr Ragab Ragab (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford) will discuss our drought risk modelliing with its implications for agriculture. The farmers and the DRY team will then visit the crop experiments and discuss the wider impacts of drought and water scarcity on Wheat, Barley, Triticale, Durum Wheat, Quinoa, Perennial Rye Grass and Lucerne. Dr Ivan Grove (Harper Adams University) will share the results of his first year of mesocosm experiments, within controlled water regimes comparing including a 50% reduction in rainfall from the Central England 50 year average rainfall and rainfall based on the rainfall for the CO2 high emissions scenario for 2050. The experiments are planned to continue for three years - with crops being rotated as per field use the rainfall patterns continuing throughout that time. The crops will experience water deficit from year to year to mirror both winter/spring and summer/autumn predicted changes.
This field visit will be followed by group discussion about the implications of this research for the UK agriculture sector, business and the public . Key questions include: Is agricultural drought risk management about changing the water regime of existing crops or changing to new crops or indeed both? The use of new crops not only has implications for UK agriculture but also involves changes in diet of the UK population. The event will be filmed by JackPerksPhotography and shared online as a prompt for further discussion after the visit. The DRY project is working with a range of stakeholders on the impacts of drought and water scarcity in seven case-study catchments - the Cornwall Fowey, Bristol Frome, Welsh Ebbw, Wiltshire Pang, Bevills Leam in the Fenlands, Sheffield Don and the Fife Eden.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd73f0150b77.29006580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dryproject.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social  Media</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>894CB0BB-E450-4831-B4D1-A2F99BBF094B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I tweet about DRY related activities as part of my own social media itnerations</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b5853c2a6f03.36309903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://twitter.com/e_weitkamp</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit (Bristol)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3A060AB-11E6-4E99-AE5A-019AA86DD455</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students learned how to measure a tree and did some bark rubbings followed by tree identification.

The system represents the combination of three models, which can, if required, be run separately. It has been designed to assess the combined impact of climate, land use and groundwater abstraction changes on river, drainage and groundwater flows, groundwater levels and, where appropriate, SWI. The approach is interdisciplinary and reflects an integrated water management approach. The system comprises three packages: the Distributed Catchment Scale Model, DiCaSM, MODFLOW and SWI models. In addition to estimating all water balance components, DiCaSM, produces the recharge data that are used as input to the groundwater flow model of the US Geological Survey, MODFLOW. The latter subsequently generates the head distribution and groundwater flows that are used as input to the SWI model. Thus, any changes in land use, rainfall, water management, abstraction, etc. at the surface are first handled by DiCaSM, then by MODFLOW and finally by the SWI. The three models operate at different spatial and temporal scales and a facility (interface utilities between models) to aggregate/disaggregate input/output data to meet a desired spatial and temporal scale was developed allowing smooth and easy communication between the three models. MODFLOW and SWI are in the public domain. DiCaSM, has been developed for unsaturated zone at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH and equally important, is the interfacing utilities between the three models. DiCaSM simulates a number of hydrological processes: rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, infiltration, soil water movement in the root zone, plant water uptake, crop growth, stream flow and groundwater recharge. Input requirements include distributed data sets of rainfall, climate data, land use, soil types and elevation. The model produces distributed and time series output of all water balance components including potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, rainfall interception, infiltration, plant water uptake, transpiration, soil water content, soil moisture (SM) deficit, groundwater recharge rate, stream flow and surface runoff. The first version was released in 2010 ( Ragab and Bromley, 2010) but under the Dry project, it has been subjected to further developments that included: 
1. Adding two options to calculate base flow 
2. Accounting for abstractions, irrigation and discharges from other sources such as treated wastewater
3. Using SQL server instead of Microsoft Access 
4. Adding fast calibration option
6. Adding more figure plotting facility e.g. base flow
7. Adding two extra &amp;quot;Goodness of fit parameters&amp;quot; to the
 classical Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE namely the 
 coefficient of determination, R2 and the NSE based on 
 logarithmic values of the observed and simulated stream flows
8. Adding a special tab for monthly climate change factors (rainfall, temperature, radiation, wind speed, vapor pressure)</gtr:description><gtr:id>7145D4B6-CE24-40ED-B255-2E4837EE03E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The early version of 2010 has been applied on the Pang catchment in the UK and on other catchments in Cyprus, Italy and Brazil to study the impact of climate change and land use changes on water resources. The studies highlighted the gap between supply and demand in those catchments up to 2050. Also quantified the possible impact of climate change on water resources. Particular interest was given to impact of changing land use to account for more durum wheat areas in Italy, use of Sugar Cane as biofuel in Brazil on water resources. The results were published and communicated by the National Researchers to their authorities in those countries for actions. More details can be found at:
