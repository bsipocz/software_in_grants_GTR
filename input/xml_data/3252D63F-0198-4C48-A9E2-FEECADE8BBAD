The university graduates 10% of the UK's engineering and science PhDs and EngDs. In the most recent research evaluation exercise, REF2014, overall, 81% of the research submitted for assessment was internationally recognised in terms of its originality, significance and rigour. Cranfield offers a mature, focused and professional study environment where students are part of a like-minded community of professionals. Our excellence in transformational research has enabled us to make significant contributions to the world around us for over 60 years. 

Cranfield's work addresses eight vital areas for business and policy-making: Aerospace, Agrifood, Defence and Security, Energy, Environmental Technology, Leadership and Management, Manufacturing and Transport Systems. Our closeness to industry means we offer relevant, practical education that is firmly based on our transformational research.
Cranfield's DTP will be used to support higher risk, &amp;quot;new and brave&amp;quot; ideas, to encourage the career development of our early career academic staff and to support fundamental research ideas developed by current EPSRC grant holders across our eight themes. Priority will be given to:
 Blue skies research that falls within EPSRC's remit, with particular emphasis on areas identified for growth - see https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/vop/ 
 Projects that include an element of training in mathematical sciences
 Collaborative proposals, especially those involving other universities
 Proposals involving early career researchers
 EPSRC grant holders or co-investigators
We will be supporting in the region of 10 studentships over two years (2016/17 - 2017/18). The projects will be selected by an internal panel from an open call for proposals. Criteria for success will be: quality of the research hypothesis, track record of the supervisor(s); quality and breadth of training provided. Students will therefore be able to apply for fully funded places from early 2016 onwards for take-up from October 2016 onwards.
Students participate in relevant and engaging seminars, for example, the &amp;quot;think bomb&amp;quot; series in which presenters showcase their research in three slides to promote interactive discussion. They also have opportunity to talk about their research with our many industry partners.
Underlying all education support activities is the development of our distinctive andragogy together with the skills and knowledge of our staff and students to improve their professional standing and employability. Transferrable skills training is delivered through the Centre for Andragogy and Academic Skills. The core skills programme for postgraduate research students is based on the established VITAE National Researcher Development Framework. A recent introduction, as part of our business skills development programme is IP training delivered in partnership with Isis Enterprise, our Knowledge Transfer partners. Students can enter a competition to win a place at Clean Equity Monaco to pitch their winning entrepreneurial idea.
Postgraduate Research Students benefit from access to a dedicated Information Specialist in the library who is the main point of contact and provides individual training and guidance on how to find the most appropriate materials to support their research.
