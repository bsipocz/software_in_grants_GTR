The focus of our research is to understand the chromatin remodelling mechanisms that regulate these antigen receptor loci, to facilitate V(D)J recombination in lymphocytes. Since these DNA loci are the largest in the genome, containing hundreds of genes that must colocalise, they have evolved several dynamic processes, including nuclear relocalisation (movement within the nucleus), histone modification, non-coding RNA transcription, 3D DNA looping (to bring distal genes together). Thus they also provide an excellent paradigm for chromatin regulation of all multigene loci. In particular, eukaryotic genomes have recently been shown to produce an enormous number of conserved non-coding RNAs, which are thought to play a vital role in many nuclear processes, including developmental regulation of gene expression, gene silencing and formation of functional nuclear substructures. However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We have shown that large non-coding RNA transcripts are generated in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus prior to V(D)J recombination and are strongly implicated in regulation of recombination. This project will determine the function of these transcripts. In particular we will test the hypothesis that these transcripts contribute to movement of the Igh locus and formation of nuclear substructures that facilitate V(D)J recombination. We will also investigate a putative role for these transcripts in trafficking of key histone modifying enzymes to targets in the Igh. State-of-the-art techniques including high-throughput fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), genome-wide next generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics will be used.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55508</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society Exhibit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC826477-BE87-4A2F-8769-DBFA66722BC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 12,000 visitors (2,500+ school students and teachers, 9,500+ members of the public) attended the week-long exhibit in London, at which they could explore our immune research and discuss research with scientists.

I have found that V, D and J usage changes throughout B cell development, with early B cell precursors using different D and J genes relative to later B cells, and B cells produced in foetal liver using different V, D and J genes relative to those produced in adult bone marrow. I have found that the changes from early to later B cell precursors are not dependent on non-coding RNA within the Igh locus, but the E-mu enhancer with the locus is required for these changes. I have proposed a model, involving changes in the structure of the locus throughout development, to explain these changes.
I have additionally found links between nucleosome positioning over the V genes and their pattern of recombination.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My group is looking further at the differences in recombination between foetal liver and adult bone marrow. Using a number of mouse models already generated by other groups in combination with the techniques I have used, it will be possible to test and elaborate on the model I have proposed to explain the choice of D and J genes used at different stages of development. The techniques can also be adapted to investigate human Igh recombination.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>97928FEC-32EF-47E5-B029-BF043DEC14AA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c46ba2630945.59154889</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Assay and bioinformatic analysis to quantify recombination frequency of mouse Igh D genes in B lymphocytes and their precursors; can be adapted for human analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>553AE378-CF7B-404A-975B-4734F9B358CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Deeper understanding and improved model of how D genes contribute to antibody diversity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c4650022c583.28206482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Igh D repertoire analysis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Provided thousands of frozen and fixed tissue samples from young (&amp;lt;14 weeks) and ageing (&amp;gt;18 months) mice to ShARM (Shared Ageing Resource Models) biorepository.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2C4555C-19BD-44B6-8FD5-979F2AA390E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Will reduce animal use - tissues that were not used in our own experiments can be used by other researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c4677cc7f978.36230988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Young and aged mouse tissue samples</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.sharmuk.org/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/B/0000M767</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
