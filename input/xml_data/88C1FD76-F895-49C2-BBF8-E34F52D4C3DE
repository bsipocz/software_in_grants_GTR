By the 1920s, massive immigration from Europe transformed Buenos Aires into the largest and most cosmopolitan urban centre of Latin America, and launched a series of vexed sociopolitical, ideological and cultural issues that occupied the minds of the politicians, intellectuals and artists of the time. The project focuses on urban space as a cognitive map of modernity's new realities and investigates how modernization and immigration impacted Argentina's cultural and ideological consciousness in this period by examining together, for the first time, a number of pivotal works of internationally renowned figures, namely Jorge Luis Borges, Xul Solar, Oliverio Girondo and Roberto Arlt, as well as of important artists who have been neglected in the English-speaking world - Jos&amp;eacute; Ferreyra and Horacio Coppola. 

The project explores the ideological, social and aesthetic agendas that lay behind these works, which developed as a response to a wide and diverse range of questions related to nationhood, immigration, modernization, social marginalization, utopianism, anarchism and technological advancements, among others. Its aim is to cast new light on the contrasting facets of postcolonial modernity and offer fresh perspectives on Argentina's urban modernity in particular, while resituating Latin American urban culture within the wider interdisciplinary research in urban studies. This is the first work on Argentine urban modernity that combines close analyses of major representations of Buenos Aires from different artistic disciplines and a theoretically informed discourse that draws on the latest developments in urban theory and postcolonial and decolnial studies (Latin America's response to postcolonial theories) as well as on other relevant theoretical concepts, some of them contemporary with the works under consideration, coming from the fields of Philosophy, Architecture, Sociology, Geography, Semiotics, International Studies, and Literary and Cultural Studies, among others. 

The research outputs will benefit both the academic community (in particular, those interested in Latin American studies, urban studies, postcolonial/decolonial studies, cultural history, cultural theory and identity studies), the public sector and the wider general public, with a six-chapter monograph (I have a proposal with Texas University Press), an international interdisciplinary conference on Buenos Aires in the interwar period, a workshop on Borges and nationalism in the 1920s at StAnza (Scotland's international poetry festival), UK premiere screenings of Ferreyra's films of the 1920s, a UK premiere exhibition of Coppola's photographs published in _Buenos Aires: una visi&amp;oacute;n fotogr&amp;aacute;fica_ (1936) which is considered a milestone in the photography of the Americas, and a Scottish premiere exhibition of Xul Solar's fascinating paintings of the 1920s and 1930s. 

With the bicentenary celebrations of Latin American Independence still underway, this project will pay tribute to one of the most hegemonic cities of the Hispanic world and will provide a new conceptual framework for understanding the complexities of urban modernity in Latin America for academics and the wider public alike. In addition, the project will financially benefit local museums/galleries and regional communities, it will offer the opportunity to the wider public to appreciate some of the most extraordinary cultural accomplishments of Latin America, it will strengthen relationships between museums and galleries in the UK and Argentina, and will build collaborative networks of researchers based in the UK, USA, Canada and Latin America.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to generate exciting outputs beyond the academic community, which will benefit the public sector and the wider general public. Its objective is to enhance knowledge, understanding and appreciation of Argentine art (painting, photography, cinema and poetry) by bringing it to greater public attention, while at the same time inviting people to rethink the ways whereby urbanism and immigration have impacted and continue to impact the social, cultural and political life of a nation. In particular, the public will have the chance to familiarize itself with the work of iconic figures of Argentine culture: Jos&amp;eacute; Ferreyra, Jorge Luis Borges, Xul Solar and Horacio Coppola. 

Ferreyra's early films of the 1920s are unique testimonies to a most significant period of Argentine history, when an influx of immigrants from Europe transformed the country's capital city into the biggest urban centre of Latin America. This radical transformation of Buenos Aires created new social networks and tensions between the local population and the immigrants as well as between different social classes. Ferreyra's cinema portrays a city divided between the rich and the poor, as it focuses not on the national origins of its citizens but on their social and financial marginalization. In this way, Ferreyra encourages the viewer to think of modernity and immigration beyond a strict nationalistic grid. In contrast to Ferreyra, in his early poetry Borges conceptualized a city void of immigrants in an attempt to recover a pre-immigration Argentine 'essence'. This was a conservative, nationalistic move that the mature Borges would later repudiate. Considering that immigration is currently a vexed issue in the UK, the work of Borges and Ferreyra will invite the wider public to critically consider how it relates to migrant communities, the ramifications of nationalism and the country's immigration policies. In addition, in the case of Borges, the participants will have the chance to discoer a different, more conservative aspect of one of the most important writers of the twentieth century, who is mostly known in the English-speaking world for his cosmopolitanism. 

Furthermore, the public will be able to admire the aesthetic brilliance of Coppola's 1936 black and white photographs, which are considered a milestone in the photography of the Americas. People can appreciate how Coppola's photographs capture a city in frenzied transformation and witness its multiple and contrasting aspects, from immigrant suburbs to revamped colonial centres, state-of-the-art skyscrapers and busy markets where the old and the new meet sometimes in harmony and more often in tension. 

Finally, the public can acquaint itself with the work of Xul Solar, one of Latin America's most exciting and idiosyncratic artists. Xul's paintings of the 1930s present us with the inner landscapes of urban modernity in so far as they focus on the individual's mental life, insisting on the possibility of eutopia: a good but also possible place that is conducive to spiritual fulfilment. People will be invited to engage with this more transcendental approach to urbanism and reflect on how Xul's utopian art may not necessarily be a mere creation of fancy. 

In general, the project will raise public awareness of the different aspects of urban life in Argentina in the interwar period through some key representations of Buenos Aires across the arts, and encourage people to think critically of their own experience within their local communities and, more broadly, within our exceedingly urbanized world. In addition, there will be financial benefits for local museums/galleries and thus for regional economies. Finally, international relationships between museums/galleries in the UK and Argentina and between academics in the UK, Europe, Latin America and the USA will be strengthened as a result of a number of activities (see Pathways to Impact).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>35000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Dumbarton Oaks Residential Fellowship, Harvard University</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Harvard University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2E276E75-A897-4683-82BF-FD53514F9D1D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cde55ddc7fa5.41996227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>For the moment, all impact is academic (e.g. invited talks, citations and a fellowship at Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard, awarded for a new project which builds on the research outcomes of the AHRC fellowship).

The systematic examination of representations of Buenos Aires across a range of artistic disciplines in the 1920s-1930s, bringing together internationally acclaimed artists and lesser-known but key cultural figures, casts new light on the multiple spaces and times of urban modernity in Argentina and beyond. This interdisciplinary study is the first to probe comprehensively and in depth the varied and contrasting artistic reactions to the socioeconomic, cultural and ideological impact of modernity in Argentina in the period 1921-1939. The examination of the work of some of the most iconic artists of the period (Borges, Arlt, Girondo, Ferreyra, Coppola and Solar) through the adoption of appropriate theoretical tools has produced some revealing and exciting findings vis-&amp;agrave;-vis urban modernity. In the eyes of these artists, Buenos Aires emerged variously as atopian, utopian, dystopian, eutopian and melotopian (or melodramatic). Studied together, these heterogeneous responses to modernity not only provided significant new knowledge about the effects of modernization, but they also opened up important new research questions about modernity as a concept and as a historical phenomenon. The historiography of the concept was revisited with the view to re-examine the value and limitations of the modern as a conceptual category and as a historical manifestation. Eventually, two monographs resulted from this award. The first centres on the interface between modernization and modernism in early twentieth-century Argentina, providing a close examination of reactions or theses on modernity as a historical phenomenon from the vantage point of literature and the visual arts. The second offers a reading of the conceptual category of the 'modern' against the grain by studying comparatively, for the first time, modernity's narrative re-imagining of Byzantium and Amerindian America in order to cast new light on their epistemic subalternization since the Renaissance. It revisits the debate on the currency of the 'modern' and its rhetorical construction against the 'others' within and beyond the borders of Europe, and invites us to re-historicize those 'others' as well as to rethink modernity's past, present and future, especially vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the anthropogenic climate change that has become the most important existential threat facing humanity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research outcomes will be taken forward in the following ways: 1.
