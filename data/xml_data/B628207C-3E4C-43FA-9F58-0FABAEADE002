If Graphene platelets can be successfully dispersed within the polypropylene matrix then it should be possible to achieve significant improvements in material properties. The project team comprises Delstar (DS), Graphene producers Thomas Swan (TS), Graphene functionalisers Haydale (HD) and the University of Bradford (UoB). The particular target application
for this research is a special type of filtration net, which is produced by extruding a thin film layer, embossing a pattern onto the film and then stretching it to produce holes. It is anticipated that by introduction of a small percentage of Graphene into the base polymer, properties such as physical strength and operating temperature of the filtration nets can be improved, which will allow polypropylene to replace more expensive and denser plastics. 

The project will explore how to achieve a good dispersion and exfoliation of Graphene platelets within the plastic without damaging them and hence reducing their benefit. Initial studies at UoB will focus on small laboratory scale extrusion
experiments using different types of Graphene (produced by TS and modified by HD) and a range of process conditions. After characterisation, the most successful compounds will be produced on a bigger scale and formed into films, which can be stretched to mimic the industrial process. Finally, after the optimum formulation and process conditions have been determined, an industrial scale batch of composite material (100kg) will be produced and used in production trials at DS. These demonstrator products will be provided to their customers for feedback in target markets. Notably, the whole supply chain for these new products, including Graphene production, compounding, extrusion/embossing and filter cartridge manufacture will be based in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research will include both the public and private sectors, particularly areas associated with Graphene and polymeric films. In the short term, the rapidly emerging UK Graphene industry will benefit from the knowledge of how Graphene features, such as platelet size and functionality, can influence the properties of a commodity polymer such as polypropylene. The polymer processing industry will benefit from a better understanding of the optimum process conditions to produce improved composite properties by achieving high levels of dispersion and exfoliation. Short-term, direct benefits will largely be realised by those sectors of the industry directly involved with Graphene and polypropylene films, however the wider understanding of polymer-Graphene composite materials will encourage further research and product development with a wider range of polymer types, production processes and applications. 

The specific focus of this project is to improve the properties of filtration netting products. Filter cartridges are widely used in a number of industrial applications for the filtration of contaminants from air, water and oils. The introduction of lighter weight, higher strength and higher operating temperature products will directly benefit many sectors of UK industry by improved performance and reduced size. Notably, all links in the proposed supply chain for the manufacture of these improved filter cartridges are UK based, so there will be a tangible benefit for the UK economy through increased market share and job creation.


The UK polymer research community will also benefit from the publication of research in this emerging field. The IRC Polymer Engineering Research Group at Bradford has significant experience in processing a wide range of composite and nanocomposite materials and will benefit from the opportunity to study Graphene composites. The IRC group at Bradford has close links with the other members of the Polymer IRC (Universities of Leeds, Durham and Sheffield) and other UK University groups specialising in polymer processing, most notably Queens University, Belfast and Warwick University. It is envisaged that increased interest in Graphene polymer composites will encourage further collaboration between these groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95206</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P510178/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D513F43E-F19D-4AB3-8E03-A47B085709AB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E4D49DD8-E515-4246-8886-C9E048C0E565</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rheology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
