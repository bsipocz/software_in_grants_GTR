Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K037323/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Walking (or cycling) around an area helps people to keep physically active in their daily life, reducing the risks of obesity and depression. Streets that are pleasant to walk along also provide opportunities for people to meet and chat with friends and acquaintances. This both enhances the quality of life and is good for health.

Busy roads can deter people from going outside their home to socialise, walk or cycle because of noise or fear of injury. This can also lead to people deciding to avoid making trips, particularly if the alternative to crossing a busy road (e.g. an underpass) increases distances or is considered inaccessible, unsafe or unpleasant. People living on streets with heavy traffic know fewer neighbours and have fewer local friends than people living on streets with less traffic; people with fewer social contacts have worse physical and mental health and die younger. When people do not even try to cross roads because of traffic, they often cannot reach shops, health facilities, services, friends or family easily. This is called community severance (CS).

All these effects are worse in older and other vulnerable groups, for whom mobility and social ties are fundamental to good health. This severance increases social inequalities and exclusion, leading to various economic and social costs. CS probably affects people's physical and mental health and wellbeing too, but this has not been studied very much. Studying health effects of community severance is challenging, as there are no agreed measurement methods that can be used easily and because this is a complex subject, crossing several areas of expertise.

We will first study two residential areas to develop an in-depth understanding and measure of CS. We will ask local residents what is important to them. We will observe what happens in practice when older people try to walk around their neighbourhood. We will consider all this information in the context of the whole area, the levels and composition of road traffic and the way streets connect to each other. We will use the information we collect to develop ways to measure CS in three ways: (i) questions to individuals to assess the effects on them, (ii) how they value these impacts, and (iii) a measuring tool to estimate the extent of community severance due to particular types of roads or road layouts. We will then test these tools in two different residential areas.

The main methods we will use are: community engagement, to explore perceptions and measures of CS and potential solutions; household-based surveys of travel behaviour, social networks, health and wellbeing; computerised surveys to elicit residents' values for severance and mitigation; on-street surveys of travel behaviour; measurement of traffic and road characteristics; space syntax methods, to study how the network of streets affect accessibility and mobility; and analyses integrating these discipline-specific methods. The final stage will be to test the impacts on CS - and thus on mobility and wellbeing - of proposed interventions to reduce CS.

By the end of this project, we will have developed and tested three tools. The first two will be for local government to use, to model and to value levels of CS in their area. The third will be a set of questions that can be asked in surveys to find out whether and how severance affects local people. The survey can then be used by local communities, providing information they can use in discussions with local councillors and staff. The tools can be used by local government to test proposed transport policies, development plans and interventions to assess whether they will affect severance. They can also be used by researchers to find out whether and how CS affects people's mobility, social isolation, and short- and long-term health and wellbeing. The survey can also be used in national surveys so that a more complete picture of this problem is obtained across the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries will include the public sector, the third sector and, particularly, older members of society. The project will increase understanding of the complex nature of community severance (CS) and its effect on mobility at different ages and degrees of disability, and its impact on independence, wellbeing, social networks, and civic engagement. New tools measuring CS that equate with people's perceptions of ease of movement around their area and how this impacts on their lives will increase understanding of individual mobility behaviour and the relationship between ageing individuals and their social and physical environments. It will enable future work to assess effective interventions to overcome constraints on older people's quality of life, providing a sound evidence base for policy and practice.

It will enable cross-sector policy development and appraisal, allowing the creation of a common language and set of issues that can then be shared between policy makers and community leaders, enabling routine modelling by planners of CS using an evidence-based design and engineering tool validated against user-centred data with particular implications for street design and spatial planning locally, nationally and internationally. Altering the built environment to reduce CS will facilitate mobility and activity and decrease isolation in ageing populations. It will enable an evaluation of how extensive CS is and how it influences perceptions of societal norms, especially where CS is severe, informing design decisions regarding urban restructuring on residents, mobility and wellbeing in complex built environments. This has implications for 'Big Society' policy nationally and social cohesion and mobility at neighbourhood level.

The study will identify 'willingness to pay' to reduce severance and knock-on cross-sector benefits of improved wellbeing and physical and mental health. It will help make the case to the Department of Transport, the Treasury and other bodies for public funding to address CS problems.

Project outputs will include survey tools that can be used nationally (e.g. Health Survey for England), locally (e.g. PLACE surveys), and in studies of older people e.g. English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to assess impacts of severance on long-term health and wellbeing.

Measuring local community severance and its impacts on individuals' wellbeing in a repeatable, validated way will enable local government to assess and mitigate existing severance and model impacts for new proposals, improving quality of life for people living and working in the UK. We intend to ensure the impact is long-lasting by creating tools for end-users, disseminated to organisations in relevant and comprehensible forms. We will also organise a final workshop for senior national policy-makers.

Interventions reducing CS and increasing mobility will help maintain older people's independence, reducing health and social care costs, and facilitate access to local goods, thus enhancing the local economy and improving local social engagement. Broader economic impact will result from increased mobility, since physically active people have better health and cost society less, adding life to years.

Existing research, such as Inclusive Design for Getting Outdoors (I'DGO), focuses on the street and home level, not the broader public realm. I'DGO's design guidance will be complemented by the proposed, validated CS measurement, valuation and survey tools, enabling planning interventions which promote mobility and social cohesion. We will enhance the capabilities of local communities to identify issues and engage effectively with professionals to address problems affecting local wellbeing. We will also strengthen and extend the capabilities of traffic engineers, transport planners, urban designers and others to recognise CS and deal with it effectively, working with local communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1281007</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Diego Portales University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Adaptation of the Street Mobility toolkit for Latin American countries</gtr:description><gtr:id>3BCCDCCC-DC81-4D41-ADAF-D2812FD01BB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The only output so far is a pump priming grant bid to fund a series of seminars and workshops in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, with the aim of developing a full grant bid.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b97e58ecc159.47001556-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Some partners introduced additional collaborators.

This was part of their Inquiry into the role of Transport for London in promoting health and reducing inequalities.
The majority of the afternoon was spent on more general transport and health topics, and about the roles of different organisations and policy options for encouraging active travel. When discussion turned to modelling and valuing health impacts, I introduced them to the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility project, the toolkit we are preparing, and the valuation tool that we are creating. 
One of the other panel members (a transport planner / engineer from a commercial company) and one of the London Assembly Members have now been invited to attend our January 2017 workshop to make the draft toolkit as user-friendly, useful, and usable as possible. We will also invite all members of the London Assembly's Health and Transport Committees to the final workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5811fa55bf3191.77368435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.london.gov.uk/LLDC/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=304&amp;MId=6100&amp;Ver=4</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transportation Research Board 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7F5EE79D-4E2B-4729-9679-3FD651A2847A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I had a large poster presentation that included information both on the toolkit and on some of the findings from the validation in the second case study area.

After the talks, I introduced the speaker to another member of our team, who was presenting a poster about the Street Mobility stated preference survey and the findings to value community severance.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b0de5bc84ad4.85563010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://annualmeeting.mytrb.org/interactiveprogram/Browse</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Universities Transport Study Group Annual Conference 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCEED6F4-E95B-4FDD-B1FA-DB3A264303F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>sparked questions and discussion afterwards</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c161d4c75ab0.74371628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in the EU COST action on Interdisciplinary Research Training School (4-day event with workshops comparing several interdisciplinary projects, including Street Mobility and Network Accessibility))</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82E31301-127A-4D4B-AA50-37A47C869CF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 4-day event with several workshops comparing several interdisciplinary projects across Europe on urban sustainability.

We have been working with local communities and with local, regional and national government, feeding back our findings and contributing, where relevant, to current consultations on redevelopment or other urban and/or transport planning.
1. We developed, tested and piloted an individual Health and Neighbourhood Mobility Survey questionnaire for local residents to complete. It has been amended with each iteration; the final version was tested in the fourth of our case studies, and a shortened version was used in a nationally-representative online survey of 2,000 adults in Great Britain.
2. We developed a Stated Preference computer-based questionnaire, which we have used, in conjunction with data from the Health and Neighbourhood Mobility Survey to create a tool to value how important people think community severance is, in financial terms.
3. We conducted PERS audits of the pedestrian environment in all four case study areas. The data have been analysed and fed back to local government staff on how easy it is to walk around an area for adults in general and for those with disabilities that affect mobility. In the fourth case study area, we trialled a less intensive version, as what is feasible in this research project would require too much person-resource in a local authority.
4. We conducted and analysed street video surveys. Again, we are currently studying how this may be made less costly for local authorities.
5. We included the use of space syntax to assess how connected an area is for pedestrians.
6. We developed a walkability model for London that included space syntax methods. This model accounted for 92% of the variability in walking, when compared with pedestrian data for London, provided by Transport for London. Transport for London are now using the model, particularly borough-level models which they are sharing with each borough to help them influence policies to increase active travel, particularly walking.
Having discovered that community severance appears to occur where walkability is high in the same places as unusually high traffic volumes, we developed a similar model for Birmingham and used it to select the fourth case study area, as a test of the model.
A UK-wide walkability model is currently being prepared for the Department for Transport, to help with planning. 
Highways England and the Department for Transport are also interested in how they can use the forthcoming valuation tool in planning and policy-making.
A community group in Milton Keynes has approached us to use elements of our toolkit but there are no impacts yet.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F9190F25-0963-4CB9-B2CF-FDC2E296E4E1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463616fe2a942.61313258</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a suite of tools to help local communities, local government staff, national policy-makers, and researchers assess and value community severance, the barrier effect of busy roads on people's mobility, lives, and wellbeing.

We have published nine working papers: 
* about cross-disciplinary research, including different perspectives, languages, facilitators and barriers to working well, using 'community severance' as the exemplar (now submitted as a manuscript to Journal of Transport and Health); 
* quantifying community severance; 
* valuing community severance economically (required for local government to justify investment); 
* definitions of community severance (ending with the area-based definition our research team agreed on; 
* developing and testing a pen-and-paper self-completion questionnaire for assessing community severance; 
* a review of non-academic literature and resources relating to community severance;
* pedestrians avoid busy roads: evidence from video surveys and bus stop data
* Analysis of the relationships between motorised traffic levels and pedestrian flows in the street network in the Woodberry Down case study area; 
* How pedestrians balance safety, walking time, and the utility of crossing the road? A stated preference study; and
* Pedestrians' preferences regarding signalised crossings, footbridges, and underpasses. 
Four papers have been accepted by peer reviewed journals, of which three have already been published. another manuscript is under review and a sixth is being prepared.
Presentations at numerous conferences have been uploaded to the project website: http://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility/Publications (Conferences tab). 
Each of these papers and presentations is available open access, except for the paper from the Transportation Research Board conference published in TRR which does not allow open access (but is the 'journal' in which conference papers are published).
The space syntax analyses for the London case studies was enlarged into a complex walkability model. We used a similar approach to define our fourth study area, in Birmingham, to validate the findings in London that community severance occurs where high walkability coexists with high traffic volumes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The final version of the self-completion questionnaire is now freely available for local communities and local, regional and national government and agencies to assess community severance in areas where there is concern, or to assess potential impacts of road or other planning schemes. We will also seek funding to include these questions in nationally-representative health examination surveys and cohort studies, to assess the links between community severance and health.
The results of the stated preference study is being made available to the Department for Transport, to feed into its WebTAG system for costing and valuing road and other travel schemes.
The tools for assessing pedestrian behaviour and the pedestrian environment have been written up for local authority use, with suggestions for less resource-intensive approaches.
The walkability model developed for London and for Birmingham and use of space syntax for smaller areas will be made available for local government, probably on a consultancy basis because of the complexity of the datasets and computing required.

It can be carried out rapidly, or through a longer and deeper engagement with individuals and groups, in which problems are identified and solutions proposed, and assessed for suitability and relevance. The project uses maps to help people visualise or analyse their local area by focusing on particular issues or questions, allowing people to share their understanding of their environment with others.
Start by visiting the area to identify places where people gather (e.g. community centres, shopping centres, religious establishments), and which ones are in the right locations to contact people who live in the area being mapped. In addition, check available online information, for example the Census, to ensure that you are making contact with the different groups living in and using the area. Contact local community groups, housing providers, and religious group and ask about regular meetings, then ask permission to attend some to get familiarity and trust. Consider how to reach under-represented group through their social connections - e.g. a local establishment that they frequent such as a church or a mosque. In addition, consider recruiting 'community champions' who can reach out locally to people who do not attend meetings or are housebound. 
After these early visits, a programme of community engagement should be carried out, in one or more of these three ways: 
1. Rapid appraisal mapping, which involves stopping people in the street and asking them to spend a little time contributing information. The information can be captured on a medium-sized map or an aerial image of the area by asking participants to carry out a short task, such as marking problem spots for crossing the street, or tracing their planned route from home to local facilities. This can also be done in a shopping centre - or even by stopping people near a local traffic node (e.g. near a Tube station).
2. Longer community mapping workshops allow participants to discuss issues more fully. Here you can follow a more detailed process, such as the one depicted in the figure below. The process can involve working in groups, in a discussion over large scale maps or aerial images, printed so people can annotate them. Post-it notes and coloured stickers are recommended to mark places on the map of concern to the group. This process can then be followed up with detailed individual work to investigate areas identified (e.g. by collecting traffic counts, or recording household perceptions) and an additional workshop can be set up to share the results with the group. Online mapping tools can be used to collate and share the information. Such workshops are best held in a place that is familiar to the participants, such as a local library or a community centre.
3. In-depth individual interviews, often with participants in the rapid appraisal mapping exercise or from community groups, can provide deeper insights into issues emerging from the maps and rapid appraisals. These can be part of the later stage of the community mapping project, in which participants share detailed experiences about their area. The use of maps or aerial images allows participants to point to problem spots or to describe different characteristics of their environment, such as informal road crossing points or places where formal crossing provision is inadequate.
Once the data are recorded on maps (either online or offline), they can be collated using a Geographical Information System (GIS) and analysed. Qualitative information and descriptions from the interviews can be classified into categories to visualise different issues across the area. This can be done by developing 'codes' - keywords that identify a specific statement or part of an interview. Work is usually needed to code and classify qualitative statements, and then to test how well the 

coding works when it is used on different interviews or maps. A classification of the findings will then be produced. This can be used to visualise the information on a map, for example by indicating places that had positive comments - and those that had negative comments. Participants can then be asked in more detail about issues they raised concerning road traffic, pedestrian crossing facilities, use of public transport, social networks or neighbourhood boundaries. The resulting map can be used to identify issues that are frequently mentioned by community members.</gtr:description><gtr:id>082316C4-B9ED-46F6-8499-943BFE7B9A90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool is freely available on our project website, launched on 8th March 2017.

It should be noted that 'walkability' does not measure how pleasant it is to walk these routes, but it is a good indicator of the potential for people to make these journeys on foot. Most walkability models include three factors:
? Residential density: how many homes there are in the area, or how many people live in the area;
? Land use mix: the variety of destinations available for people to go to, and how many there are; and
? Connectivity: this assesses how easy it is to walk between two places in the area. It can use standard distances along pavements and paths, or the number of junctions there are in a standard area ('junction density'). Other models use space syntax to assess this;
? Some models also include other factors, such as public transport accessibility. This measures the fact that people are more likely to use public transport and less likely to drive if they are in closer proximity to bus stops or train stations.

Walkability models can be used by local government to ensure that the conditions for pedestrians are particularly good (pavement quality, lighting, greenery, etc.) in areas that have high walkability, particularly if budget cuts prevent good conditions everywhere.
They can also be used to identify areas of community severance, where the effects of busy roads reduce the likelihood of people walking for local trips. Community severance occurs where areas of high walkability occur in the same place as busy roads. Local government may wish to use walkability models to identify these areas as places to reduce traffic speed or traffic volume, or to improve the number of crossings and the time they allow for pedestrians to cross the road.

Two different walkability models for London have been created by members of the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility research team. Both have been validated using data on walking.
The walkability model developed by Dr Ashley Dhanani uses a multi-layered approach. It measures land use diversity, taking into account all types of use, including all the floors in a building, as well as intensity of that land use, as well as public transport accessibility and office land use intensity. This means that the model includes a large variety and a high number of potential walking destinations. Street network accessibility is then assessed using space syntax methods. The model represents walkability values as continuously varying, while most models use administrative boundaries for their data and modelling. See image below of whole London walkability model. 

 This model has been proven to predict observed pedestrian demand (based on a large database of measured pedestrian activity across London), accounting for 82% of the difference in walking activity levels between areas. The model has also been produced for Birmingham (see case study below), and is currently being developed for the whole of the UK. The walkability models themselves are not publicly available, but for further information about the models, their applications and access to them please contact ashley.dhanani@ucl.ac.uk.</gtr:description><gtr:id>49C89DC6-4D71-4BEF-96E7-A017FF2F7FC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See Policy and practice section</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bec06a057028.75654042</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Walkability model using space syntax</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility/toolkit</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This involves placing video cameras at particular points to film pedestrian and motor traffic. This is usually done for a 24 hour period or a 15-16 hour period (i.e. daytime). conducting video surveys is not novel, but the way we have analysed the data and the uses to which we have put the data is novel.

The information collected from the video survey helps building a more detailed picture of who uses the road, when, and how. Taken together with results from a walkability model, the comparison of the actual pedestrian flows along different roads with what might be expected from the walkability model can give an indication of places that pedestrians avoid. These may indicate where action is needed to improve the conditions for pedestrians and to facilitate more walking for travel in the area. The data collected can also be used to identify particular problems faced by pedestrians at different times of the day, which may be related to variations in the levels or types of motor traffic.

Some local authorities will already have cameras in place. Otherwise, there are a number of companies that can place the cameras at agreed locations on an agreed date. Some of these companies will also analyse the data, for a fee.
Thought is required regarding where to site the cameras. This includes where each camera should be, and which way it should it face. The more cameras are used, the more information can be obtained. However, more cameras will increase both the cost and the amount of staff time required to view the video footage and analyse the data.
The video footage can be used to record a number of items. Each of these will require a separate run-through for every camera:
? Vehicle flow (how many vehicles per hour or per day).
? Vehicle composition (the proportion of private cars; lorries; buses; coaches).
? Pedestrian walking flows (how many pedestrians per hour or per day).
? Pedestrian crossing flows: the number of pedestrians who cross at 'formal' crossings, (such as pedestrian signals, zebra crossings, footbridges, and underpasses) and at 'informal crossings' (which indicates where 'desire lines' are, where people want to cross the road, such as near a bus stop).
? Pedestrian crossing behaviour (where, when, and how people cross the road).
? Waiting times to cross the road.
Pedestrian data can be disaggregated by age-group, gender, and disability, if the quality of the video footage is good enough. However, this will increase the time required for the analysis.
A number of indicators can also be estimated from the raw data, for example, crossing ratios (the number of people crossing the road as a proportion of people walking along the road), or the number or proportion of people using the pavement who have an encumbrance, such as being in a wheelchair, using a mobility aid, pushing a buggy, or having luggage.
The cost of a video survey varies, depending on how much analysis is done in-house or by the company implementing the survey. There is a fixed cost of around &amp;pound;400 for setting up the cameras. Each camera then costs around &amp;pound;35 (for 15-16 hours). Basic analysis of the footage costs &amp;pound;25 per movement recorded (for example vehicles in one flowing on one direction or pedestrians walking in one direction on one pavement). More detailed analysis (for example, of pedestrian crossing behaviours) costs more. These values exclude VAT and were valid in 2015.

To make the analysis workload more manageable, the motor and pedestrian traffic counts can be done for parts of the day only, for example, for a 15 minute period during each hour (e.g. from 16 to 30 minutes past each hour), or without disaggregating the direction of the flow. The classification of motor vehicles and pedestrians can also be simplified (for example, vehicles can be counted simply as light or heavy). Vehicle and pedestrian flows can also be counted manually, without using video surveys. Data on the annual average daily vehicle flows in motorways and main roads can be downloaded from the Department for Transport's website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F02ACA26-E92B-43CF-AB7E-0CE924813B57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final version has been made available by free download, launched on 8th March 2017.

Busy roads can cause problems for people who want to walk along them or to cross them, and also for people living nearby. In addition to noise and air pollution, the main difficulties are caused by:
? the volume, or sometimes the speed, of traffic;
? too few crossings; and
? not enough time to get across. 
All these can be unpleasant, but they can be more than that too - they can affect people's health and wellbeing. The impacts can be direct, for example from air pollution. They can also be indirect: for example, health can be affected when busy roads separate local residents from goods, services, or other people. This barrier effect is sometimes called 'community severance'. The UCL Street Mobility team has developed this toolkit, offering a suite of research approaches to identify, assess and value this barrier effect or 'community severance'.

This toolkit contains tools developed to help local government and local communities assess, and value the costs of, community severance in their area. Knowing what the problem is in more detail helps to make a case for change. 
The toolkit is divided into eight sections, as follows: 
Introduction (this section) provides background information about the purpose of this project. It includes a table summarising the various tools for assessing the barrier effects of busy roads and what resources are needed to use for each one.
What we know summarises the evidence about what 'community severance' is and how it affects people's lives, including their health and wellbeing. It also includes some references, for anyone who wants to read more about this. All work produced by UCL Street Mobility team members is available to all (open access). Where possible, we have used freely available sources for referencing other people's work, but access to some studies may be restricted.
The next five sections explain the tools we have created to help local government and communities measure the effects of busy roads (Participatory mapping, the Health and Neighbourhood Mobility survey, Video surveys, Valuation, and Walkability).
The last section describes other, existing tools that we have found useful (Space syntax, Street audits). 
Which tool (or tools) are selected for use depends on:
? What the users want to find out and/or measure; and
? What resources they have available (time, people, expertise, money).

A Table is included in the toolkit to help potential users decide which tool(s) to use. It lists the tools, describes what they are for, and what resources are needed to use them. Each of the tools can be used independently, but can also be used in combination with any of the other tools, and in any order. 
For example, a community group might use participatory mapping and a street audit. A local authority might start with the Health and Neighbourhood Mobility survey and the valuation tool. A single tool can provide useful information, but using a range of tools will provide a more comprehensive assessment. The tools allow the problem to be broken down into smaller sections that can be dealt with by different people or groups. The toolkit also helps to forge links across sectors and departments. Local community groups and local government staff working together can produce the best information.

Certain people, such as children and the elderly, or those with physical or mental health impairments, may be particularly sensitive and vulnerable to the effects of busy roads. Several of the tools contained in this toolkit can be used to identify and assess such inequalities. 

The tools will generally be used to measure the current barrier effect. However, some of the tools can be used to predict what the effects might be if there are changes. They can contribute to a vision of what streets can be like. They can also be used to monitor or evaluate the effects of interventions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FA0D0CD-1557-4ACE-9D15-54442DA26D0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It was launched on 8th March 2017, so it is too soon to show any impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bec16084f8b4.39213154</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Street Mobility Toolkit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/street-mobility/toolkit</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Health and Neighbourhood Mobility survey is useful for finding out what proportion of local residents have problems from motor traffic, or have other problems walking around the local area. Analysis of information collected through the survey may also reveal health inequalities, such as whether people with mobility impairment are more affected by fast or heavy traffic than other local residents are. Details about how the questionnaire was developed are available on the project website. 
In brief, we used existing questions where available, validated for other surveys. New questions were tested with local residents in a different area of London by discussing what they thought the questions were asking ('cognitive testing'), then improving the questions, and trying them out ('piloting').
The questionnaire starts by asking about the person responding, including their age group, gender, and how long they have lived at their address. This information means that users can check whether the people who answer the survey are typical of people living in the area. It also allows you to see if different groups (e.g. men and women, or older and younger people) have the same concerns, or are bothered by different things. 

The questionnaire also includes a few questions about general health, and about disabilities that affect people's mobility. It then asks some specific questions about the effects of busy roads. First there are questions about problems walking around the local area. Next, there are questions about the busiest local road.

We have also written a guide to conducting a survey, aimed at community groups, based on the New Economics Foundation's guide for communities on measuring wellbeing; a guide to conducting simple analyses of the data (again, aimed at community groups), and an Excel sheet for data entry and simple anlayses.

The questionnaire, the two guides, and the Excel sheet can each be downloaded from the 'Other documents' section of the page.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3557139A-DE77-449E-898A-24F8D2378327</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An early draft of the questionnaire first used by others as part of the Leverhulme grant reported on previously in ResarchFish.
