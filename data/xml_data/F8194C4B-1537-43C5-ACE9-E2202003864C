Chemical synthesis is at the heart of the research into these issues as it can deliver the complex compounds required to overcome these challenges. The synthesis of the complex molecules on which we all depend is increasingly a balance between cost and benefit. There is an urgent need to develop novel methods to access these compounds that maximises our resources whilst reducing the overall cost of the process. Finding clean and efficient methods for the formation of added-value compounds from simple low cost starting materials is one of the major challenges facing chemists and chemical engineers. One approach to overcome these challenges that is used extensively in all areas of contemporary synthesis is catalysis. A catalyst is a compound that lowers the energy required to effect a chemical reaction leading to more mild and efficient processes. To overcome some of the challenges associated with complex molecule formation, our research develops a clean, mild and efficient method for the formation of valuable compounds called amides from an underutilised chemical feedstock by using catalysis. Amides (RCONH2) are utilised extensively in the study of biological process as well as in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and polymers. Unfortunately, traditional methods for amide formation produce a significant amount of by-products and waste. Reducing the amount of waste produced during amide formation is the number one problem facing the pharmaceutical industry as recently highlighted at a roundtable discussion of leading scientists.

Our research seeks to catalytically activate nitriles to avoid the use of wasteful reagents and lead to a more efficient synthesis of amides. Nitriles are a functional group that contain a carbon-nitrogen triple bond and are used for a variety of carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond forming reactions. These sorts of transformations are vital for the synthesis of the range of chemical, pharmaceutical, and raw materials on which our society depends. In addition to providing improved access to these important compounds, this method will ultimately benefit the economy, environment and the day-to-day quality of life of the general public by making important compounds readily available at decreased overall costs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential Beneficiaries

The development of an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of enantioenriched amides from all nitriles will produce benefits to many stakeholders. The novel process outlined in this proposal allows for the synthesis of these important compounds in a mild and efficient manner whilst limiting the overall cost in terms of time, expense and waste. Amide synthesis is performed on a day-to-day basis in both academic and industrial laboratories despite the current limitations. Therefore, in the near terms all scientists involved with the synthesis and use of amides will benefit immensely from this research. This is especially true for researchers in the areas of pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemical research. As highlighted in the proposal, the mild, selective and environmentally friendly synthesis of amides is the number one problem facing chemist in these areas. Additionally, the academic community will benefit from this research through the development of a new area of catalysis and heterocycle formation (as discussed in the academic impact section).

Impact of Research

Importantly, the proposed research will have a profound and immediate impact on industrial researchers, as the processes employed for the synthesis of amides will be rendered more efficient and less wasteful. Our investigations will increase yields and flexibility in the synthesis of amides whilst decreasing waste to ultimately give higher profit margins in an environmentally friendly manner. The feasibility and reaction development studies outlined in the proposal will have a direct impact on the way compounds are synthesised on a daily basis. Additionally, the novel process found in this proposal will open up new areas of chemical space for exploitation. Having direct access to novel building block is another key way that this research will impact industry. 

Facilitation of Knowledge Exchange 

A number of different routes will be employed to facilitate the transfer of our technology into the chemical industry. Importantly, we will have the experience and backing of the School's Business Partnership Unit (BPU) to assist in knowledge exchange (for more details please see the pathways to impact statement). Firstly, the BPU will appropriately protect any intellectual property deemed to have commercial value. This will allow for direct negotiations with industrial partners that are interested in utilising our platinum-MFC process. Additionally, Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTP) with industrial partners will be examined as a means to not only transfer our technology into an industrial setting, but also provide for its further development. There is specific funding set aside within the University to support KTP's and sufficient resources within the BPU to support this form of knowledge exchange. Finally, though our efforts to disseminate the results of our research to a wide audience (i.e. primary literature, presentations at conferences and videos), interest in the research area will be stimulated leading to increased collaborations through CASE awards with industrial partners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA00F2D8-8383-4AD1-8C8F-29C8AD922FB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glucose-Derived Palladium(0) Nanoparticles as in Situ-Formed Catalysts for Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reactions in Isopropanol</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp;
