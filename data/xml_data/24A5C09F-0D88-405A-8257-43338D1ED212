The European Water Framework and Groundwater Directives place explicit requirements on Member States to establish national groundwater monitoring programmes. Sampling in aquifer systems is, however, a non-trivial problem and is particularly difficult where only long-screen (&amp;gt;3m) monitoring wells are present. The samples may comprise a mixing of waters of different chemistries and provenance with wells potentially giving rise to non-natural flow environments. Use of such wells is thus often criticised, but in practice often there is no alternative to their use; eg long-screen wells form the backbone of the Environment Agency's (EA) monitoring network to serve the above Directives. They are also common in contaminated site monitoring where aquifer thicknesses are large (most major UK aquifers) and it is feared that more discrete sample points may miss plumes. The situation is similar in many other countries. Key questions are: - can such wells yield useful information? - how should they be sampled to maximize usable information? - how should this information be interpreted? These are key issues for regulators, consultants, technology providers and problem holders alike. Solving these problems requires consideration of the hydrogeology of the sampling device / aquifer system, whether for example more convenient modern low-flow/purge / passive systems are inherently better than purging, how the origin of the sample can be identified, and how the well-water sample can be back-analyzed to estimate in situ groundwater quality. This studentship therefore seeks to address such questions through a university, technology provider (Waterra) and regulator (EA) collaboration. It is hypothesised that increased capture of reliable, rigorously interpreted groundwater quality data can be achieved through improved understanding of the sampling systems used. The aim is hence to develop rigorous, process-based monitoring protocols for long-screen wells that allow cost-effective acquisition and reliable interpretation of groundwater quality data. This will be achieved via objectives: to review literature and practice; to compare rigorously sampling technologies in long-screen wells in various settings to allow their process-based optimal application; to develop model-based data interpretation and tools that may guide optimal sampling and interpretation of water quality data; and, to transfer knowledge into much needed national/international monitoring protocols. The current EA guidance, technically authored by Waterra, is nearly a decade old during which there has been much technology development. Four contrasting major-aquifer study sites with substantial existing data will be used in a field programme involving comparative emergent technology testing and investigation of controlling processes. Modelling will be used to interpret new and archive data to understand processes influencing sampling performance and to provide best estimates of groundwater quality distribution. A general goal is to develop and validate a model-based practitioner tool that may guide optimal sampling of long-screen wells and enhance interpretation of data arising. The project is expected to not only produce the practitioner guidance and tools noted, but also 6 scientific journal publications. The project diversity with data review, field study and modelling works permits an excellent student-training environment. The collaboration of experienced academic, technology-provider and regulator permits a 3-way input that is critical to the project genesis and success with training, facility, interpretive inputs from partners well beyond the university capacity. It allows scientific evaluation of a practitioner issue with planned progression to regulatory guidance and science literature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73055</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/H019170/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
