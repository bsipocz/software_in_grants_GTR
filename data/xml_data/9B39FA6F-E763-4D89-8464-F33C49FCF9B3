These are areas of strength within the Norwich Research Park (NRP) which hosts a number of research institutes with strategic programmes that are recognised as international leaders, in particular in areas around the generation of novel antibiotics and other valuable secondary metabolites such as terpenes and anthocyanins. More recently the development of targeted genome editing technologies have emerged as another complementary area of strength within the NRP. The DNA synthesis facility within the NRP will also contribute to enhance the opportunities to develop computational methods in areas relevant to systems biology complementing other technology platforms within the NRP. The focus will be on the modelling of gene networks, which is placed at the interface of systems and synthetic biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The focus of the facility will be on construction of long DNA fragments including whole plasmid-like genomes and the generation of recombinant libraries that could be used for high-throughput screening of advantageous phenotypes. The facility will be hosted by The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) and the activities will be focussed around areas of application that are priorities for the NRP. The engineering of specific compounds and the ability to screen for the effect of diverse genotypes will complement the well-established DNA sequencing platform at TGAC positioning the NRP as technologies leaders in the area. We propose to incorporate the DNA synthesis equipment within the current genomics platform which is mainly funded through the BBSRC's National Capability Grant. In this way we will leverage the investment in infrastructure regarding project management support and laboratory set up with the possibility to offer very rapidly a DNA synthesis service accessible to the wider UK plant and microbial community. There is however an intention to develop the services around the areas of expertise and application relevant to the NRP scientific vision. The development of technical expertise in DNA synthesis will be initially focused on three areas of active research: novel antibiotics, exploitation of the NRP yeast resources and plant genome editing. A fourth area of interest is the design of predictive computational and mathematical models. The recently created Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy Alliance (IIBA) within the NRP will serve as a catalyser to bring the research groups working in these areas together in a coherent technology development programme led by TGAC.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The delivery of the Programme's objectives is focused on the deployment of a DNA synthesis facility: an area of technological development that is complementary to the current research programmes within the NRP. In this way the delivery of the proposed objectives will have a direct impact in areas of research relevant to the three BBSRC scientific priorities in food security, bioenergy and biology underpinning health. This facility will aim to integrate established methods in genomics and bioinformatics with emerging areas of research in systems and synthetic biology. 

Academic, Economic and Commercial Impacts
The development of the DNA synthesis platform will generate new opportunities for collaborative work with R&amp;amp;D groups in industry and academic institutions within the NRP, nationally and internationally. We will also enhance the service portfolio of TGAC's NCG Genomics with the DNA synthesis capacity, in this way ensuring the UK scientific community remains at the forefront as an international leader in life sciences.

Societal impacts 
The deployment of the proposed DNA synthesis within the NRP will directly impact the local and national communities with the generation of new funding opportunities and the development of new skills. TGAC's presence in the Norwich area has strengthened the position of NRP as a technology hub hosting specific expertise in biotechnology and computational biology. The proposed DNA synthesis facility will create new opportunities around the development of services, which will potentially translate into new opportunities for collaborations. TGAC computing facilities and access to expertise and resources has already delivered impact as it is one of the largest data processing centres in the UK.

BBSRC, Research Councils and UK 
The deployment of cutting-edge technologies will enhance the NRP reputation and will support the development of expertise on new strategies for data analysis. The development of specific skills in computational methods related to DNA synthesis technologies will deliver impact to a broad range of stakeholders emphasising the key role the Institute will play in enabling researchers to develop innovative science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1903000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>John Innes Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ENSA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>60DC1325-DE56-4939-98E2-716FC32B6D7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration is multidisciplinary, and combines laboratory automation, synthetic biology, next-generation sequencing.
