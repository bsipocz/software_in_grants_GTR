Yet meeting the development needs of the majority of the world?s people in a carbon-constrained world presents a global challenge of staggering proportions. What is the role of institutions and policy processes in reconciling the growing levels of demand for energy investment in rapidly industrialising countries, with the goal of clean development aimed at facilitating a transition to a lower carbon economy?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This issue goes to the heart of this ESRC Climate Change Leadership Fellowship. The programme of work will explore the conditions in which the governance context nationally and internationally helps to determine (i) the nature, scale and direction of investment flows in the clean development sector (within and beyond the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism) and (ii) the extent to which those flows are able to simultaneously satisfy social as well as environmental ends. The work will be undertaken over 3 years in Argentina, India and South Africa and includes a PhD studentship, visiting fellowships for academics from those countries, a postgraduate conference and training workshops and outreach events with a range of policymakers. The programme aims to contribute to this critical policy debate as well as generate new empirical material and theoretical innovation in the areas of climate policy and environmental governance more broadly.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>260129</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Innovation and technology transfer for sustainable energy systems in developing countries</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BDC9363-167E-4182-970A-2B249DEB0D74</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9566134b9566148-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Event organised in collaboration with Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands. This event presented analysis of existing mechanisms for technology transfer for sustainable energy 

systems in developing countries, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), as well as critical 

aspects that need to be addressed if technology and innovation are to deliver their potential, such as 

governance, and the need to move beyond a narrow focus on technology hardware and finance. 

Building on this, the event presented latest thinking on recent policy initiatives: i.e. how technology 

transfer can form part of a low carbon development strategy and on the implementation framework for 

the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTC&amp;amp;N). A panel of speakers then discussed if and 

how these more recent initiatives can be structured to meet developing county needs for innovation 

and technology transfer.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department for International Development (DfID)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Climate finance : lessons from the governance of clean development and the clean development mechanism (CDM)</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1B168D5-EFC6-407D-AA9E-7E83B7C7C8C6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9567a66b9567a84-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Briefing for Department for International Development on experience with climate finance to date and current and future UK government priorities for reform.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Climate negotiations : BBC Radio 2</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F8E6E94-38B0-4FD1-A0D7-F46D3F79F2B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Extracts from a BBC News 24 broadcast in which Professor Peter Newell was interviewed about the outcomes of the Canc&amp;uacute;n climate summit negotiations were used on this BBC Radio 2 broadcast.

transfer under the CDM. He suggested that many of the governance challenges will be similar and 

emphasised the role of power, participation, and the ways that governments can prioritise sustainable 

development benefits. He presented research indicating that technology transfer under the CDM has 

been limited to operational aspects of technological knowledge and suggested reasons for this including 

the lack of value attached to sustainable development and the question of who approves and evaluates 

technologies and institutions. Peter also suggested lessons for the TEC, including the role of local 

institutions in ensuring broad participation in technological priority setting, the additional governance 

challenges for small project developers and Less Developed Countries, and how governments can align 

national strategy with new and existing initiatives. Peter concluded with the statement that despite 

important differences, the CDM can provide lessons for the Technology Mechanism. One audience 

member disagreed on the basis that the CDM provides projects for established technologies, rather than 

cutting edge new technologies. http://www.ecn.nl/fileadmin/ecn/units/bs/IEC/COP17/ECN__US_COP17_Side_Event_Innovation_and_TT_Summary.pdf

Details of the impact
As summarised in section 1, this research has had impacts in the following four areas:
1. The work of the UN CDM Executive Board:
In 2011, the UN CDM Executive Board (EB), which is the highest governmental decision-making body on carbon markets, held a closed retreat to discuss challenges facing the CDM in the wake of series of crises engulfing global carbon markets. A briefing note on Newell's research was produced for this retreat, following an invitation to 'well-known leaders and thinkers in this area' [see Section 4, C1]. This was shared with Board members and made a 'key contribution' to ensuring the success of the retreat [C2]. The most significant outcome of the retreat was agreement to launch a Policy Dialogue on the CDM.
2. The UN's Policy Dialogue on the CDM:
Newell's engagement with this Policy Dialogue process involved: formal submission of evidence to the Dialogue Panel; distribution of this evidence to a range of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, including the UK government and the then chair of the CDM EB who participated in a public debate about the research [C3]; dissemination of academic publications to many of the same stakeholders; and various presentations, including at the May 2012 UN climate change negotiations in Bonn, at an event organised by the NGO CDM Watch [C4]. The chair and discussant at this event, who were both members of the CDM Policy Dialogue High-Level Panel, directly engaged with the evidence presented and expressed their commitment to take forward its findings [C5]. This engagement activity in turn had the following impacts:
(i) UK government submission: The research and formal evidence were extensively drawn upon by the UK Department for International Development in its submission to the Policy Dialogue. This submission called for efforts to improve the governance of the CDM including an appeals mechanism; improved local consultation and stakeholder engagement including promotion of best practice; ex-post assessments of the sustainable development contributions of projects; and sanctions for projects failing to deliver these outcomes. These proposals drew heavily upon and directly mirrored those called for in Newell's research and submission to the Dialogue Panel [C6].
(ii) Policy Dialogue paper on governance: Significant traces of Newell's research are evident in a key Policy Dialogue report. This report recommended that the CDM EB 'assist DNAs (Designated National Authorities) in coordinating more effective local stakeholder consultations and improve the accountability of project proponents to local communities throughout CDM project design and implementation' [C7]. This recommendation directly mirrored Newell's proposal for an alternative CDM governance process based on clear national clean development strategies; common guidance on public consultation; strengthened DNA capacity; and continuous monitoring and ex-post validation [C4].
(iii) Final reports: Likewise, the final Synthesis Report of the Dialogue process reproduced several of the main findings of Newell's research. This includes statements that 'most studies employ varying criteria to assess impacts and occasionally lack any ex-post assessments, relying on information provided by project developers when requesting registration, rather than on post-implementation data'; that 'comparison of projects across different countries shows that their contribution to sustainable development depends both on project type and host country'; and that '[s]ome stakeholders indicate that the capacity of host countries to follow-up on the initial assessment of a project's contribution to sustainable development is limited given the paucity of resources in many cases' [C8]. Key recommendations from Newell's research also featured prominently in the Final Report of the High-Level Panel, including its call for the CDM to 'strengthen and restructure its governance' by 'enhancing its openness and transparency, and opportunities for stakeholder participation, creating avenues to hear appeals and address grievances'. This included increased monitoring of sustainable development benefits, efforts to strengthen national capacity in this regard, sanctions in cases of harm caused by projects, and guidelines on adequate local consultation procedures. Echoing the recommendations of the research, it is stated 'There is a clear need to improve the reporting, monitoring, and verification of the sustainable development impacts of CDM projects, and to implement safeguards against projects with negative impacts' [C9].
In the wake of this Final Report and the pressure generated by researchers and NGOs, state Parties to the UN climate negotiations called on the CDM EB to act. It did so by approving a voluntary tool for describing sustainable development co-benefits of CDM projects at its 70th Board meeting in November 2012, moving away from original opposition to acceptance of an additional tool for recording such benefits. In light of the shortcomings highlighted by this and other research, the CDM EB has also sought to encourage governments to share experiences of local consultation processes.
3. Advisory and training work:
Newell has also undertaken extensive advisory and training work, with impacts on policy processes. For example, Newell serves as Senior Policy Advisor on the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change's (DECC's) International Climate Fund, in which capacity he has served as an evaluator of business cases for the joint DFID/DECC Carbon Markets Finance initiative and has provided input which has had direct impacts on the design and development of this initiative [C10].
 
And he has provided training for various policy bodies on the CDM, some of which have in turn had direct impacts. For example, Newell participated in a training session for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, at the end of which the parliamentarians attending issued a communiqu&amp;eacute; calling for tougher action on climate change which specifically emphasised the 'risks from international carbon trading mechanisms' highlighted by Newell [C11].
4. Public awareness of the shortcomings of carbon markets:
Key findings from Newell's research have been extensively covered in all forms of mass media. Leading broadsheets covering the research have included The Guardian, The Times of South Africa and The Financial Times, for whom Newell produced an interactive guide on climate politics in the run up to the December 2011 Durban conference. The research has been covered on numerous TV and radio channels, including Sky News, BBC News 24, BBC Radio 2 and BBC World in Spanish, which featured a full page story on Newell's research [C12]. Newell's research has also featured in the 'The Carbon Con' documentary, which was screened at the Durban conference at a side-event with panel discussion organised by CDM Watch, and has been downloaded from YouTube and other media over 3,000 times [C13]. Newell's research has also been widely cited and drawn upon by advocacy NGOs working on climate change issues, including the Rainforest Foundation, the Global Forest Coalition, and The Corner House in the UK [C14].</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09F32274-DEFD-458B-9BEC-8125E67F45A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cd1ddca53a4.71423995</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There is increasing recognition that effective institutions are required to govern carbon markets such as the CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) of the UN to ensure they provide social as well as environmental benefits.



Whereas most research to date looked at market-based factors for the performance of the CDM, this work analysed the role of governance in politics in shaping who benefits, who loses how and why from the CDM. The CDM is a market-based offset mechanism which allows richer countries, that have legal obligations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, to pay poorer ones for projects that reduce these emissions more cheaply. In return, developing countries are meant to receive sustainable development benefits such as jobs, technology or improved health and environmental outcomes. 



The research sought to understand what difference governance makes to the ability of the CDM to deliver these twin goals. It involved field work in Argentina, India and South Africa including interviews with around 150 people in government, international organisations, business organisations and NGOs. Key findings were published in 3 books (2 co-authored and one co-edited), 8 journal articles, contributions to consultancy reports and commentary pieces for journals and media. 



The research highlighted a number of key governance deficits in relation to participation, accountability, coordination and capacity which are inhibiting the ability of governments to realise environmental and developmental benefits from the projects. These included poorly organised processes of local consultation, weak checks on the sustainable development contribution of projects and collusion between actors that are meant to have distinct and separate roles.



It looked at these issues across a range of levels from the UN's CDM Executive Board, to national governments that have responsibility for approving and screening projects, down to local bodies that oversee local consultations and participation with local communities about the risks and benefits associated with the projects they are asked to host. The research also pointed to the importance of getting to grips with issues of power, politics and political economy which are significant shapers of who captures benefits and what terms from carbon market projects. 



It provided both conceptual tools for understanding the role of governance and politics in carbon markets and practical recommendations about how the markets might be more effectively and equitably governed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research has been put to use in a number of ways described below.



At the international level a briefing note based on the research was produced for the UN CDM Executive Board about challenges facing the CDM for discussion at a closed retreat. The retreat led to a call for a Policy Dialogue on the reform of the CDM emphasising issues of governance and contributions to sustainable development highlighted by the research as key areas for the dialogue to address. The report itself noted 'allegations that certain CDM projects have had negative sustainable development impacts have prompted calls for increased standards and scrutiny in this area'. As well as submitting evidence to the dialogue panel that was then set up, testimony was given at a side-event organised by the NGO CDM Watch in May 2012 in Bonn at the UN climate change negotiations before members of the High Level Panel of the CDM Policy Dialogue. The chair and discussant at this event both came from the High level panel (Prodipto Ghosh and Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe) and engaged directly with the evidence presented and expressed their commitment to take forward its findings.



Indeed the report that resulted from the dialogue process specifically reproduces some of the main conclusions of the presentation that 'most studies employ varying criteria to assess impacts and occasionally lack any ex-post assessments, relying on information provided by project developers when requesting registration, rather than on post-implementation data' and that 'A comparison of projects across different countries shows that their contribution to sustainable development depends both on project type and host country'. The final report also conveys a principal finding of the research where it is noted that 'Some stakeholders indicate that the capacity of host countries to follow-up on the initial assessment of a project's contribution to sustainable development is limited given the paucity of resources in many cases'. Other key recommendations from the research which featured prominently in the final report of the dialogue include the call for the CDM to 'strengthen and restructure its governance' by 'enhancing its openness and transparency, and opportunities for stakeholder participation, create avenues to hear appeals and address grievances' including increased monitoring of sustainable development benefits, efforts to strengthen national capacity in this regard and sanctions in cases of harm caused by projects plus guidelines on adequate local consultation procedures. Echoing our recommendations it is stated 'There is a clear need to improve the reporting, monitoring, and verification of the sustainable development impacts of CDM projects, and to implement safeguards against projects with negative impacts'. Records of the side event above state: 'Peter Newell, University of Sussex, synthesized research on the impact of CDM on sustainable development. He described an alternative process based on: clear national clean development strategies; common guidance on public consultation; strengthened Designated National Authority (DNA) capacity; and continuous monitoring and ex-post validation'. The CDM Policy Dialogue research paper on governance then issued a recommendation to 'Assist DNAs in coordinating more effective local stakeholder consultations and improve the accountability of project proponents to local communities throughout CDM project design and implementation'. The summary report of the stakeholder consultations undertaken as part of the dialogue also noted our calls for further monitoring and capacity building for SD benefits and the use of sanctions where necessary.



At national level the research was also drawn upon by the UK government in its submission to the Policy dialogue which called for efforts to improve the 'governance of the CDM' including an appeals mechanism, improved local consultation and stakeholder engagement and ex- post assessments of the sustainable development contributions of projects: reforms we had been promoting based on the research. The nature of the sanctions proposed by the UK government for projects failing to deliver these outcomes reflect exactly those we had recommended in our reports and which were highlighted in press coverage of the findings. The call to clarify the CDM's interaction with, and value added to, other relevant initiatives mirrors closely our own call to consider 'how the CDM can best add value and create synergies with other policy initiatives to generate finance for low carbon development'. Interactions with DECC officials about how the research informed their strategy with regard to reform of the CDM led to an invite being issued to serve as a Senior Policy Advisor to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change on its International Climate Fund and to review funding applications under its remit providing a direct channel to influence policy decisions. This built on DECC's earlier use of the framework developed by the project in a paper on global carbon market institutions.



Also at the policy level, impact has also been achieved through training sessions based on the research. These were organised, for example, for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association on the Clean Development Mechanism that led to a call by parliamentarians attending issuing a call for tougher action on climate change which emphasised strongly the governance themes emphasised in the training session with them. The communiqu&amp;eacute; lead Western Australian MP Giz Watson to demand that 'The climate change policies of all political parties in WA should be reviewed and updated to reflect the rapidly changing knowledge about Climate Change and the increasing urgency of a shift to a low carbon economy' . In the latter regard mention was made of the 'risks from international carbon trading mechanisms' which the training session focussed on.



Impact on public opinion via the media, meanwhile, has taken a number of forms. Insights from the research also featured in a documentary 'The Carbon Con' which was screened at the UNFCCC meeting in Durban in December 2011 at a side-event and panel discussion organised by CDM Watch. The film has so far been downloaded on youtube and other media over 2,700 times. It also includes coverage for the research on TV channels such as Sky News, BBC News 24 and BBC World in Spanish, which featured a full page story on the research, leading broadsheets such as The Guardian, The Financial Times for an interactive guide on climate politics in the run up to the Durban meeting in 2011 was produced, The Times of South Africa, BBC Radio 2 and a series of specialised publications such as CDM &amp;amp; JI Monitor for whom a guest commentary was produced, and the International Oil Daily. As well as being reproduced across specialist media, the new items were used in briefings from NGOs such as the Rainforest Foundation and Global Forest Coalition as well as The Corner House in the UK in their advocacy work on these issues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>225C6616-1C91-48C8-93EA-FAB71A3EABB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7599735900.386923b2f0ad4a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.clean-development.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Impact on CDM Policy Dialogue</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E0493D5-CE9C-4A11-9112-2066A50BCB66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this research has had impacts in the following four areas:
