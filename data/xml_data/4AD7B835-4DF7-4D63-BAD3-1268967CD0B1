New multifunctional scaffolds that both mimic the mechanical properties and structure of natural tissues and are able to promote cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation are now urgently needed. The aim of this project is to develop new hyper-branched poly(glycidol)/poly(caprolactam) (HBPG/PCL) based injectable gel scaffolds that have the potential to enable bone growth and the regeneration of cartilage in vivo, following application in a minimally invasive manner. They will thereby enable effective treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) without surgery. OA is characterized pathologically by localised loss of cartilage, remodeling of adjacent bone and associated inflammation. OA is one of the leading causes of pain and disability worldwide. New covalently-linked scaffolds that exhibit gradually increasing mechanical strength will be formed in vivo from physically cross-linked HBPG/PCL particles in a safe and effective way, in the absence of UV-radiation. They will feature tunable elastic modulus values and will undergo enzyme-triggered disassembly. The proposal will benefit the NHS by improving patients' quality of life, reducing surgical costs and boost the UK economy by shortening patient recovery times and reducing productivity losses due to disability and/or illness. The proposal greatly extends Dr. Halacheva's earlier studies on biomaterials scaffolds and will be conducted by a postdoctoral research associate (PDRA) and a University of Bolton funded Ph.D. student over a period of 15 months.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit and how?
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which currently affects 10 - 15% of people over the age of 60, worldwide. The cost and burden of OA is anticipated to expand greatly due to the increasing average age and bodyweight of the world's population. Herein we aim to establish a new injectable gel technology that has long term potential to regenerate cartilage and bone tissue in vivo. The project will tackle the current gap in knowledge and provide an important step in the optimisation of injectable gel scaffolds intended to be used as a minimally invasive treatment for tissue disorders. The main beneficiaries of the project will be:

Patients: OA is the most common cause of disability in the UK. Pain, stiffness, joint deformity and loss of joint mobility have a substantial impact on individuals' quality of life. From a clinical perspective, the HBPG/PCL injectable scaffolds that are proposed to be developed will have the potential to minimise patient discomfort, risk of infection, scar formation, and the overall cost of treatment. Current treatment strategies for OA involve joint repair or total replacement using implants. The surgery does not restore the native tissue or reinstate natural biomechanical properties. The new HBPG/PCL injectable gels will enable regeneration of native bone or cartilage tissue in vivo without invasive surgery. Our approach has potential to provide a quick patient recovery time and long term pain relief from OA. 

UK economy: OA has a significant negative impact on the UK economy, with its total cost estimated to be 1% of GNP per year. In 2010-2011, &amp;pound;43 million was spent on community services and &amp;pound;215 million was spent on social services due to OA (see Pathways for Impact). In this proposal new injectable scaffolds will be developed that have the potential to reduce the treatment costs associated with OA and impart a positive impact upon the UK economy.

Healthcare organization: OA exerts a considerly negative impact on health services. Approximately two million adults per year visit their GP due to OA. Over a one-year period (2013-2014) there were 114,500 hospital admissions in the UK alone. The project will improve the quality of life by developing a minimally invasive treatment solution for OA that will not require hospitalisation or long recovery times.

Professional bodies: EPSRC, TSB, BBSRC, MRC, Biomedical Research centres and units and the NHS will benefit from the novel approach for preparation of the injectable biomaterials that demonstrate improved biomechanical properties and controlled cell differentiation and propagation.

Academics: See the section entitled Academic Beneficiaries.

People: The research programme will train a PDRA by providing him/her with the opportunity to work in partnership with a Ph.D. student, Dr.Halacheva and staff from the collaborating organisations. The PDRA will attend an international conference, a UK-based workshop and will be actively involved in engagement activities with national and international research teams. The training of the PDRA will have a direct economic impact via provision of skilled workers who may subsequently be employed by any beneficiary organisation. The project will also facilitate the development of the Biomaterials Research Centre at the IMRI, University of Bolton for the training of chemists and bioengineers.

Society: The new injectable HBPG/PCL gels will enhance the quality of life and improve the population's health by enabling effective treatment of medical conditions for which there are no existing minimally invasive therapies.

End users: NHS, Arthritis Research UK and the Multiple Sclerosis Society, industrial companies such as GE Healthcare, Smith &amp;amp; Nephew, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will benefit from the novel optimised injectable scaffolds that will fulfil all the engineering design criteria for a regenerative device.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99845</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht</gtr:department><gtr:description>Investigation of the HBPG/PCL self-assembly in water</gtr:description><gtr:id>D840A637-3B1A-4B14-B81C-3EDA4A28EBDF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>By using SAXS it was possible to determine the structure, size and morphology of the aggregates formed form the HBPG/PCL copolymers in water at various concentrations and temperatures.

In 2010-2011 approximately 181,350 patients suffering with OA were admitted to hospital in the UK. The resulting cost of hip and knee replacements was estimated to exceed &amp;pound;850 million whereas the indirect costs from OA caused over &amp;pound;3.2 billion in loss of economic production, &amp;pound;43 million was spent on community care and &amp;pound;215 million on social services. There is a clear societal support and economic impact of the project in terms of importance to UK healthcare and global economics. It offers a new minimally invasive therapy which will reduce the treatment costs associated with OA, will enhance the quality of life and reduce the pain, recovery times and morbidity in patients. The project will have the potential to foster global economic performance, to improve the UK's economic competitiveness, to increase effectiveness of public services and policy and to enhance health and creative output.
The project's findings also contribute to the existing knowledge concerning synthetic polymer-based biomaterials in general, particularly those which are to be used as injectable gels for tissue repair purposes. The synthetic route employed for the preparation of the HBPG/PCL copolymers constitutes a novel application and improvement of pre-existing methodology which may be of use to the wider polymer chemistry community.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6913EA76-B8A6-42C3-B5E1-3556BCD7E75A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58a1a0015e1ca4.19833924</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A simple chemical procedure which does not require the use of toxic or costly reagents was utilized for the synthesis of the HBPG/PCL copolymers. 
A completely new approach has been used for the development of trimethoxysilane-capped HBPG/PCL-based gels .It is well known that the free radicals formed as a result of UV-exposure can react with cellular components and induce malignant transformation via the formation of reactive oxygen species. Our simple method for the preparation of new load-bearing HBPG/PCL gels is based on dual gelation of a crosslinked aqueous dispersion of thermo-responsive copolymer particles which does not involve the use of harmful UV-mediated photocrosslinking, free radicals or toxic metal catalysts. It offers the possibility to control the gels' mechanical properties, porosities, biodegradabilities and routes of cell differentiation by tuning their copolymer compositions, architectures and extents of crosslinking.
The next stage of the project, preparation of mechanically strong gels from HBPC/PCL block copolymers under physiological conditions, has recently commenced. The gels are derived in two steps: firstly, the physical gels are formed from a concentrated dispersion of HBPG/PCL particles upon exposure to physiological temperature conditions. In the second step, the physical network is locked in place in vivo due to the gradual hydrolysis (and subsequent Si-O-Si crosslink formation) of trimethoxysilane groups.The covalently-linked gels will exhibit gradually increasing mechanical strength over time (as the extent of methoxysilane hydrolysis and crosslinking proceeds), as well as tuneable degradation kinetics and therefore will be particularly attractive in space filling and load bearing applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new HBPG/PCL scaffolds could provide a new minimally invasive treatment for OA that is currently non-existent.
