It draws on AHRC-funded research of the Principal Investigator into the history and theory of magic, and communicates key themes to the most eminent institutions in the English-speaking world of magic. It combines this with specialist expertise within these institutions in order to communicate the significance of the research, and of magic as a performing art, to the wider magic community, and to the public.

The project will focus on communicating key themes, based on AHRC-funded research, and related research since. In particular, it will clarify what is 'real' in the performance of magic. This matters because there is a common perception that either magic is real, or else it is not, and that this kind of magic is relatively trivial, because it is merely fiction. This is one reason why magic is regarded as unimportant in relation to other forms of theatre. It is also one reason why many performers, in search of relevance, have made false claims, and convinced the public that what they do is real. In doing so, it will emphasize the purpose of performance magic in its own terms: to create 'astonishment'. This matters because we are increasingly jaded, and now take for granted technological wonders that would have seemed magical to our ancestors. However, magic has been able to survive by continually developing more sophisticated techniques, and employing subtler psychological approaches, in order to create effects that continue to reveal, in the most direct way possible, the limits of our view. By presenting magic as a dynamic performance art, with neither false claims nor trivial disclaimers, the ongoing relevance of magic as a performing art can be better appreciated.

The project will involve three overlapping phases. First, the Principal Investigator will give presentations to magicians at the above institutions, which communicate his research on the history and theory of magic. Second, he will collaborate with key members of these institutions in the communication of these themes to the wider magic community. This will include enhancing their educational programmes to improve the historical and theoretical understanding of the next generation of magicians. Third, he will collaborate with these institutions on new exhibits at their premises, which will be on display not only to magicians but also to tens of thousands of visitors each year. These exhibits will incorporate not only textual but also video elements, which convey, in novel and direct ways, what magic is about, how it survived, and why it continues to matter. The video will include authentic historical recreations of specific magic effects, which show how they have developed over time in order to continue to astonish an increasingly educated public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit, and how might they benefit?

Members of The Magic Circle and the Academy of Magical Arts will be provided with a better understanding of historical and theoretical research, which can be used to help frame their performances.

Young magicians of the Young Magicians Club (The Magic Circle) and the Junior Society (Academy of Magical Arts) will benefit from enhanced educational programmes, which promote greater historical and theoretical understanding, and which provide a more meaningful definition of magic.

The Magic Circle and the Magic Castle (home of the Academy of Magical Arts) will benefit from new displays for their visitors, which will present a positive image of magic as a dynamic performance art.

Visitors to The Magic Circle and the Magic Castle will be able to view a novel display, which provides new insight into what magic is, and locates contemporary performance within a dynamic historical process of interaction with public perceptions.

The Conjuring Arts Research Center, and researchers at the Magic Circle and the Academy of Magical Arts, will benefit from stronger links with the academic community, which will provide new pathways for research. 

The wider magic community will benefit from a more focused debate about the role of history and theory in the framing of magic for audiences, which provides a definition of magic on its own terms, without appeal to genuine psychic, psychological or physical abilities. This, it is hoped, will lead to audiences being provided with a more authentic experience of magic as a performing art in its own right.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23529</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is an exhibit that will be on permanent display at the Magic Circle, which will be seen by both members and visitors.

NOTE: the exhibit is not yet in place, but will be in the next few weeks. The initial delay was due to the workload of the relevant person, who does work for the society on a voluntary basis. It was prolonged due to an unconfirmed plan to change the layout of the museum. However, it has now been confirmed that the exhibit will feature in one of the two large display cases in the Magic Circle museum. As this is a core part of the Magic Circle tour, this means that it will be seen by all visitors, as well as by members. The display will also now include relevant artifacts from the Magic Circle museum. The installation process has already begun.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F50F4F05-EC58-487E-8EBB-220913F806D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibit is not yet in place (see above).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ecfe9c4824.83508924</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Magic Circle exhibit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is an exhibit that is now on permanent display at the Magic Castle, which can be seen by both members and visitors.
