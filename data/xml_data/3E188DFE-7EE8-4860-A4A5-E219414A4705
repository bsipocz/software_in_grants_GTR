For example when rivers leave behind sediments, channel deposits may sit within floodplain deposits, such that ribbons of sand become encased within a muddy background. To describe and study sedimentary systems such as these, sedimentologists use descriptive terms such as &amp;quot;channel&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;floodplain&amp;quot; to recognise building blocks that together stack up to build a rock volume. These building blocks are called architectural elements. Geologists also recognise that architectural elements may themselves stack up in organised patterns, and such organised patterns of elements can be placed in hierarchical arrangements. For example, channels may stack together to form channel complexes, and channel complexes may build channel complex sets. This hierarchical descriptive approach can work in the deposits from a wide range of sedimentary environments: e.g., rivers (fluvial rocks), shallow seas (shallow marine rocks) and deep seas (deep marine clastic rocks). 
Sedimentary systems built from pre-existing particles (such as sand grains, or mud grains, that might make sand- or mud-stones) are known as clastic systems. In the right circumstances, such systems may form hydrocarbon reservoirs. This happens when the sediment is buried, but with connected pores between the grains still open (i.e., without minerals growing in the pores during burial to seal the rock). If oil or gas migrates into connected pore spaces, but cannot migrate out, because the rock above is sealed in some way, the hydrocarbon filled rock volume may have the potential to be an oil or gas reservoir, if there is enough hydrocarbon in place, and the predicted flow rates are high enough.
To predict whether a known hydrocarbon accumulation might make an economic reservoir - i.e., be worth developing - oil companies model its behaviour as a possible field. They may first build a sedimentary model, recognising different architectural elements and the way they are stacked together. They will then account for any deformation the rock experienced during or post deposition. Finally they will simplify this geological model to build a reservoir simulation model, in which the performance of the possible field can be predicted. Ideally the company would build the geological model using seismic reflection data that showed the basic geology (this is a remote sensing technique that builds 2- or 3D images of the subsurface geology based on processing the reflections of sound waves sent into the ground). However, the resolution of these techniques is usually not good enough to show exactly what the subsurface geology is like, and the companies have to use models to fill in the data they can't see directly. 
To build these models, companies commonly use computer techniques to generate synthetic geology at the finer scale, using algorithms that randomly generate patterns of architectural elements based upon modelling rules. However, problems often arise because these rules are not always based upon the way the geology actually tends to stack together in particular settings. The database approach is a new way of determining what these organisational rules should be. They provide data that are more reliable, because the data are all compiled from real world examples of geology. We have already applied this approach to rocks deposited by rivers, and in the deep sea, and many companies have used the results in their own modelling. However, the approach hasn't been tried yet for shallow marine rocks - and that's what we aim to do in this project. Shallow marine rocks host many oil and gas fields, so if we can improve the modelling of such fields, we'll have a significant impact upon the efficiency of the companies who use the technique, as we'll reduce the uncertainly they commonly experience when deciding whether or not to develop a field, and how to extend the lives of fields that are already producing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69135</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Engie</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Shallow Marine Research Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>8236E17F-4C34-4FBD-85B5-B53FB2E28525</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Colombera L; Mountney NP; Hodgson DM; McCaffrey WD (2016) The Shallow-Marine Architecture Knowledge Store: A database for the characterization of shallow-marine and paralic depositional systems, Marine and Petroleum Geology, 75, pp.83-99. doi: 10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.03.027</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b89fd16cb4.58782320-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>N/A</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a new industry-facing consortium project, led by a team of 3 Leeds colleagues, (Dave Hodgson, Nigel Mountney and me) extending the Turbidites Research Group approach to Joint Industry Projects (JIPs) to a new application area.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have contributed to the marketing of an oil-industry - facing consortium research project.

The database allows incorporation of data from the published literature, which are uploaded to a common standard to ensure consistency in data definition. The database stores data for geological entities of varied nature and scale (i.e. surfaces, depositional tracts, architectural elements, sequence stratigraphic units, facies units, geomorphic elements), including attributes that characterize their type, geometry, spatial relations, hierarchical relations, and temporal significance. Furthermore, metadata are also stored (e.g. data types, data sources), and all geological entities are assigned to depositional systems, or to parts thereof, that can be classified on multiple parameters (e.g. shelf width, delta catchment area).
The database can be interrogated by means of SQL (Structured Query Language) queries to generate quantitative information on the sedimentary architecture and geomorphic organization of shallow-marine to paralic depositional systems. All the data can be filtered on the parameters used to classify the depositional systems (e.g. selection of rift basins, macrotidal coasts, seas with wave power density lower than 10 kW/m), as well as on all the associated metadata (e.g. selection of datasets based on outcrop studies, Cretaceous systems, data collected after 1990), to facilitate the selection of depositional systems that represent appropriate 'analogues' to subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs of corresponding types. This information can then be exported to spreadsheets in a format suitable for analysis and presentation.
The database output allows a characterization of the organization of depositional systems and of their formative sedimentary and geomorphic units at multiple scales, in terms of hierarchical relations, proportions, geometry, transition statistics and distributions of lower-order genetic units in higher-order packages.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0DED2FE7-E6B8-4FA6-A5C5-5525B01C26EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SMAKS database can yield output with which to undertake an empirical characterization of many reservoir analogues, from which quantitative models, or rules that describe the heterogeneity of reservoir types, can be derived. This application ideally enables the identification of correlations between different architectural properties and predictions of reservoir characteristics away from data coverage.
The ability to query for sedimentological properties and to apply filters to the database output permit the selection of analogues that share user-specified characteristics, which could be sedimentological characteristics (e.g. occurrence of a particular type of sedimentary deposit) or parameters that describe the depositional context (e.g. type of sedimentary basin, coastal tidal range), or both. The synthesis of quantitative information from multiple case studies results in the construction of composite analogues, which incorporate variability in sedimentological and stratigraphic properties, and are therefore suitable for the quantification of associated uncertainty. These composite analogues are adoptable as quantitative facies models that have been proven to be useful for the definition of conceptual models of hydrocarbon-reservoir heterogeneity, for conditioning stochastic geocellular models of the subsurface, and for guiding correlations of sandbodies or mudstone units across multiple boreholes.
Furthermore, the devised database addresses the necessity for the integration of datasets that are heterogeneous and in part interdisciplinary, and this will likely facilitate the application of meta-analysis as a research approach in sedimentary geology. Meta-analysis consists in a technique for combining results from different studies to determine the sensitivity of a response variable to some factors. Early SMAKS output indicates the potential of this database for fundamental research based on meta-analysis: the compilation of composite datasets arising from multiple case studies will aid comparative analyses that may yield novel insight into the sensitivity of sedimentological products to different forcing mechanisms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c71718ea30.80907806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Shallow Marine Architecture Knowledge Store (SMAKS)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13800ABE-77BC-4BE3-B055-3C0BE9BABCC2</gtr:id><gtr:title>A test of analog-based tools for quantitative prediction of Large-scale fluvial architecture</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AAPG Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e97fa5d65dfeee9593e3d41be3eb4536"><gtr:id>e97fa5d65dfeee9593e3d41be3eb4536</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colombera L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>01491423</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ef772db3e5.34422325</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A75AA1BB-D7FC-47FC-A140-56F819354594</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Shallow-Marine Architecture Knowledge Store: A database for the characterization of shallow-marine and paralic depositional systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine and Petroleum Geology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/004a32fce3e23586075da980a7261a16"><gtr:id>004a32fce3e23586075da980a7261a16</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colombera L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d7f7d09ba88.72610160</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42624EC2-FCAF-4263-A2B5-2270BC8BF1D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geometry and compartmentalization of fluvial meander-belt reservoirs at the bar-form scale: Quantitative insight from outcrop, modern and subsurface analogues</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine and Petroleum Geology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/004a32fce3e23586075da980a7261a16"><gtr:id>004a32fce3e23586075da980a7261a16</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colombera L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7eefad9a463.30122722</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M007324/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>859194A3-8EE1-41D7-90C5-DA2999B93E8E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth Resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5537B6B2-9FD6-40FB-B300-64555528D3FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sediment/Sedimentary Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
