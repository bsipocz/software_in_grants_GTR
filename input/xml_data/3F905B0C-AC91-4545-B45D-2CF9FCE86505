Epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of flavonoid-rich diets is associated with reduced CVD risk. In addition, recent systematic reviews of data from high quality clinical trials have shown that consumption of certain flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods significantly reduce CVD risk. There is huge potential for the development and marketing of flavonoid-rich foods that reduce CVD risk, and EFSA is reviewing hundreds of dossiers of evidence in support of such health claims. But, there is an almost complete lack of evidence of the mechanisms involved in vivo. This is largely because the majority of existing proposed mechanisms have not been shown to occur at the sub-micromolar concentrations observed in blood and tissues, and do not take account of extensive human metabolism of ingested flavonoids. The host research team have recently discovered that certain polyphenols that are present in red wine, strawberries and cocoa potently inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling in vascular endothelial cells at sub-micromolar concentrations. Because VEGF is pro-atherosclerotic, inhibition of VEGF signalling is a plausible mechanism to explain flavonoid-induced reductions in CVD risk.
The objectives of this project are to:
(i) determine the molecular basis of the inhibition of VEGF signalling by dietary polyphenols,
(ii) examine the effect of human metabolism of polyphenols on the efficacy of VEGF signalling inhibition, and
(iii) develop and validate an in vitro cellular model, involving intestinal metabolism and absorption processes, suitable for assessing the potential impact of ingested polyphenols on VEGF signalling.
The project will provide a molecular understanding of a plausible mechanism by which dietary flavonoids can reduce CVD risk.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204700</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>By demonstrating which polyphenols are effective and which are not, we have created a rationale for focussing future research and development in this area. Developing and evaluating polyphenols as inhibitors of VEGF signalling is a key component of a 28-partner EU collaborative project coordinated by Kroon which includes 15 SMEs from across Europe. Some of these are interested in exploiting the VEGF-inhibitory properties of certain polyphenols, and there is already a patent submitted by one of the partners (revenue agreement with IFR, Kroon is an inventor).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57D7EBE5-6353-4E46-9487-687F9BC0A283</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464acddee5d67.83911444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objectives were to investigate which types of dietary polyphenols were effective inhibitors of VEGF signalling and which were not, establish how the normal changes in the polyphenol structure that occur during absorption and human metabolism affected their ability to inhibit VEGF signalling, and to develop a new in vitro model that incorporates human metabolism in assessments of VEGF inhibition.

The main findings were:
(1) Of 60 polyphenols tested, only a limited number (about 5) were considered potent inhibitors of VEGF signalling (i.e. were effective at low physiologically-relevant concentrations). This shows there is considerable specificity for the polyphenol. The most potent polyphenols were from green tea, apples, red wine, pomegranates and chocolate, and they could inhibit 50% of the VEGFR2 activation activity at concentrations below 1 micromolar which is in the physiological range.

(2) Phase-2 metabolism, which is a normal bodily process whereby small sugars or sulphate groups are added to xenobiotics to make them more soluble and tagged for excretion via the kidneys and liver, had a negative effect on the VEGF inhibitory activity of the polyphenols. However, some polyphenols like EGCG from green tea are not phase-2 metabolised and so they would still function as effective inhibitors of VEGF.

(3) We successfully developed a co-culture model involving CaCo2 cells that were a model of small intestinal epithelial cells which effectively metabolised the polyphenols, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells which are a model of the vascular endothelium, and used this to explore the effects of metabolism on VEGF-inhibitory activity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Now that we know which polyphenols are effective, we and others can focus future research to demonstrate their efficacy on these and not on potentially ineffective polyphenols. We have already worked with an SME and developed some protection of the intellectual property in this area. It is expected that this company and others will seek to develop products that are based on inhibition of VEGF signalling and angiogenesis.

Our in vitro model has significant potential utility in future research, because it is suitable for studies of polyphenol efficacy using a whole range of endothelial-relevant biomarkers, not just VEGF signalling.

If this early stage basic research can be translated into study outcomes that demonstrate beneficial effects in animal models or human subjects, then the public could be informed of the most suitable and effective dietary sources of these polyphenols and be advised to consume suitable quantities to achieve the health benefit(s).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74B18313-0D34-4EBD-8702-2D1E168EE99A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464a6d83cd0a9.63341492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>60FF20B7-12C4-4D7D-8C16-88950C32D1E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>CAN DIETARY POLYPHENOLS PREVENT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BY INHIBITING VEGF-DEPENDENT ANGIOGENESIS IN ATHEROSCLEROSIS?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ATHEROSCLEROSIS</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a4ab906a8db41387f25851812d64356"><gtr:id>6a4ab906a8db41387f25851812d64356</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards R.
