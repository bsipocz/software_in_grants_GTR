It is particularly serious in infants and young children, where it is more likely to spread from the lung to other parts of the body. The reason why the disease is more severe in infants and young children is still not clear, but immaturity of the immune system seems to be a key factor. 

Protection from TB is known to involve a particular type of white blood cell called the macrophage, which resides in the lung and is the first line of defence against this bacteria. The aim of this project is to study whether the macrophages of infants respond less effectively to the TB bacteria than the macrophages of adults. To achieve this aim we will separate macrophages from the blood as well as from the lung secretions of healthy infants, as well as from adults. We will then study the characteristics of these immune cells and their ability to destroy TB bacteria in the laboratory. 

The research will be performed as part of a PhD project by a paediatrician training in infectious diseases and immunology. It will be carried out under the supervision of Professor Tracy Hussell, director of the Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, who has particular expertise in macrophage research. The paediatrician will also be supervised by Dr Peter Arkwright, a Senior Lecturer in Paediatric Immunology who works at the adjoining Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, the largest single-site children's hospital in the UK, where there is a rich source of clinical material from patients undergoing procedures from which lung secretions and blood can be taken. Ethics permission has already been obtained from the NHS to collect these clinical samples, and consent will also be sought from all parents and participants before any samples are taken. 

The results of this study will help us understand how the macrophages of infants differ from those of adults, and how these differences make infants more vulnerable to TB. By understanding more about maturation of the macrophage during the first year of life, we hope to be able to design better vaccines to protect infants and young children from this serious disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Tuberculosis (TB) in infants carries a major morbidity and mortality worldwide, largely due to the high rate of disseminated TB in this age group compared with adults. Airway macrophages are critical in mycobacterial immunity as the first line of defence against TB. However the ability of macrophages to contain TB bacilli in infants compared with older individuals has not previously been studied. This aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that infant anti-mycobacterial immunity is impaired because age-dependant regulatory pathways increase the threshold of macrophage activation.

Macrophage function is suppressed by a number of cell surface receptors that raise the activation threshold, such as CD200R and AXL. My preliminary data suggest, that infant macrophages constitutively express a greater degree of some negative regulatory receptors (CD200R), while others (AXL) may be increased by an infant type 1 interferon (IFN) bias during mycobacterial infection. To build on these initial observations, I will compare the in vitro anti-mycobacterial macrophage function of healthy infants and adults, using airway and blood samples. The expression of CD200R and AXL will be measured by flow cytometry. I have developed an in vitro model to assess the functional relevance of CD200R and AXL to TB immunity, by measuring macrophage phagocytosis of TB bacilli using confocal fluorescence microscopy and ImageStream (alongside anti-mycobacterial cytokine production using cytometric bead array). The underlying mechanisms of CD200R and AXL regulation will be explored by the addition of exogenous type 1 IFN, or neutralising antibodies. Finally, the cellular source of infant anti-mycobacterial production of type 1 IFN will be confirmed and as well as the underlying mechanisms driving its production in infants.

Fully understanding age-dependant pathways of macrophage regulation is critical to determining which pathways represent novel therapeutic or vaccination targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work outlined in this proposal will explore the question of why infants and young children are vulnerable to tuberculosis (TB), with particular attention paid to how macrophage function develops during infancy. As such, the &amp;quot;root beneficiaries&amp;quot; of my research outputs are those most vulnerable to severe TB: infants and young children. Four target groups will help translate the findings of this study and deliver the benefits:

Academics: This study's innovative approach to obtaining and immuophenotyping infant macrophages will have a broad impact, because macrophages are important in a number of childhood infections and inflammatory diseases. For example, it is not known if functional immaturity of the macrophage is responsible for the select vulnerability of infants to other intracellular infections that target the macrophage, such as Listeria monocytogenes. To maximise the impact of my research in these areas, I have therefore formed a collaboration with a research group investigating early life listeria vulnerability led by Dr. Tobias Kollmann (University of British Columbia, Vancouver). My research findings will also be of use for researchers working on the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases that are more common in infancy and childhood, such as eczema and asthma. Data on the maturation of macrophage function in infancy will provide such researchers with a novel basis to perform further work in their field.

Biomedical industry: By providing a mechanistic understanding of how the infant immune system is susceptible to TB, my findings will be of interest to the biomedical industry in the design of novel vaccine strategies and immunomodulatory treatments. The World Health Organisation have highlighted the global priority to develop a new vaccine against TB, particularly given BCG vaccine is only partially effective at protecting infants from TB. Improved knowledge of infant macrophage function will provide a foundation for developing novel vaccination and adjuvant strategies. In addition, improved knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities of the infant immune system will facilitate the design of novel immunomodulatory treatments for other childhood inflammatory conditions. Though the realistic timeline for such novel therapeutics and vaccines is 15 years, early interaction with industry will help maximise the translational potential of my findings. Continued interaction with the biomedical industry is possible as my group is based in the Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research, a joint venture between the University of Manchester, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. 

Global Child Health Community: Since the majority of global child mortality occurs in infants living in low-resource settings, it is important that my findings are communicated to the relevant stakeholder groups who can affect change in this area. For example, defining the kinetics of macrophage regulation may influence the timing/sequence of the infant vaccination schedule. I am well placed to achieve these interactions through my work with the International Group of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and other organisations such as the Children's HIV Association Africa. 

Clinicians: By studying healthy infants, I will generate novel reference data on macrophage function in this age group. This data may be of use for clinical immunologists, in the investigation of children with unexplained recurrent/severe infection, thereby defining novel primary immunodeficiency involving the macrophage.

Finally, this fellowship provides the opportunity for me to undertake a period of focused research and training, in order to develop the skills to achieve my goal of becoming a clinician scientist and leader in infant immunity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>784F7773-925A-44C5-AA4F-47BEBFF7601A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Role of Mast Cells in Tuberculosis: Orchestrating Innate Immune Crosstalk?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/87e742ce0f544cff5203906afe02fbde"><gtr:id>87e742ce0f544cff5203906afe02fbde</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garcia-Rodriguez KM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-3224</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a84aac193cc08.70981529</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3EEA0CED-7922-47E9-90C4-9B10136F4B81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Axl and MerTK receptor tyrosine kinases maintain human macrophage efferocytic capacity in the presence of viral triggers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfc10be8a7e89321cdc74cdd1f189cbd"><gtr:id>cfc10be8a7e89321cdc74cdd1f189cbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grabiec AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-2980</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a84aac12ec0e6.25739303</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CED1CC67-64C8-4302-A6EA-3730C5D7200C</gtr:id><gtr:title>TLR vaccine adjuvants: closing the stable door before novel influenza strains bolt?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Immunology and cell biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/86142b460f1cf0a7ecf7e1718361b611"><gtr:id>86142b460f1cf0a7ecf7e1718361b611</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hussell T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0818-9641</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a84aac1dd8946.02584636</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>44FBC6B4-4E9D-43CC-A2B5-982BEADD6B5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diminished airway macrophage expression of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with defective efferocytosis in asthma.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfc10be8a7e89321cdc74cdd1f189cbd"><gtr:id>cfc10be8a7e89321cdc74cdd1f189cbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grabiec AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0091-6749</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a84aac171a0c1.18133310</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N001427/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
