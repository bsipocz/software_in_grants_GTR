The approach is based on the development of an innovative solar thermal collector by Larkfleet Ltd using novel optimised Fresnel lenses to create low-medium temperature thermal energy for use in the manufacturing sector. 
Using Cranfield University expertise in precision engineering and concentrated solar thermal energy, this system will be modular and compact to be easily installed and operated for easy installation and operation. 
This technology will drastically reduce the need for natural gas and coal generators, and provide a more affordable and sustainable source of low-medium heat.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will demonstrate a solution for the use of solar heat in industrial processes that overcomes the current barriers associated with this energy source.

Academic impact
This project will generate enhanced knowledge of solar collector technologies for low-medium temperature thermal energy generation using Fresnel lenses. This will provide a novel test field demonstrator for long term thermal energy storage and will help to build skills and expertise within the local science and engineering community at Cranfield University. This will increase collaboration between Larkfleet Ltd. and Cranfield University with anticipated student placements and academic publications following project completion. Finally, international academic groups such as Fraunhofer ISE (Germany) and CEA (France), involved in solar thermal research, would be interested in collaborating based on this advancement in technology.
Environmental Impact
The Solar Steam collector will drastically reduce the carbon emission related to industrial processes by eliminating the need for coal or natural gasses. The carbon savings calculated in a case study in Spain amounts to 1000 tons of CO2 equivalent/year. Based on 22kg of CO2 offset for each tree planted, this equates to 45,000 trees/year. The lenses will be made from acrylic plastic which is 100% recyclable, compared to vacuum tubes and parabolic troughs which must be disposed of carefully. Fresnel lenses that are UV cured should last 20-25 years compare to 15 years.
Economic impact 
Heat demand accounts for approximately 76% of energy consumption in the industrial sector. On average, manufacturing facilities use 95.1kWh of electricity and 566 million Joules of natural gas per square foot annually. The potential for the use of solar heat for industrial purposes is still largely untapped despite its potential as a reliable energy source (only 140 installed facilities worldwide in 2014). Lenses made from plastic are 20-40% cheaper than standard glass solar collectors supplied by current market leaders (i.e. Clique Developments). This results in a lower financial barrier to adoption for the end user. Annual savings of &amp;pound;39k/annum have been reported (based on a modelled case study on behalf of an SME laundry company in India) with a break-even time of less than 3 years compared to over 8 years for competing solutions (i.e. linear Fresnel reflectors). The primary target markets for Solar Steam are countries that are closer to the equator (i.e. Asia, Southern Europe). This means that the project outcomes will result in large export revenues for the UK (5 year revenue projection of &amp;pound;16.7 million).
Social impact 
This project will provide a breakthrough in green technology and will establish the UK as a centre of excellence for further research and development. With its high export potential, investment into the UK supply chain in the assembly and installation of the system will be attracted. Being a modular and dispatchable system, Solar Steam will facilitate access to clean heat for industrial facilities that might experience problems in energy supply. The diffusion of point focus collectors in the Indian textile industry is a clear example of the need for reliable, secure and cheap technology to supply energy where accessibility is limited. Solar Steam will provide energy security to developing nations, providing industrial and commercial users in remote areas with additional heat and cooling. The system installation will require the use of local subcontractors within targeted countries, leading to an estimated 390 jobs within 5 years and increased revenue within developing areas. An estimated 50 new jobs throughout the supply chain, including resellers, manufacturers and maintenance staff in developing countries (India, Asia).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102428</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P031072/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>97AD4D1C-4499-4C7E-AF8A-FE9EFE56E306</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1175C1D0-52DD-4F11-A1B8-E080CABC3609</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
