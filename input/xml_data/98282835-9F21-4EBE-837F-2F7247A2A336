They arise in many important areas of human endeavour, for example
finance (daily closing values of the FTSE 100 index; the order book of a financial
instrument evolving over time), economics (interest rates set by a central bank;
monthly changes to macroeconomic indicators; yield curves changing through time), 
engineering (speech signals), natural sciences (temperature, seismic signals) and 
neuroscience (brain activity measurements via EEG, fMRI or other techniques), to 
name but a few. Typical tasks faced by time series analysts include understanding 
the nature of and modelling the evolution of the time series, forecasting its future 
values, understanding how it impacts and is impacted by other factors, and 
classifying it to one of a number of categories. Solving these tasks adequately
can have enormous positive impact on economy and society.

Modern time series datasets often defy traditional statistical assumptions. In many 
contexts, time series data are massive in size and high-dimensional (e.g. in 
macroeconomic modelling, where many potential predictors are frequently included 
in models e.g. for GDP growth), non-normally-distributed (e.g. in finance where daily 
returns on many financial instruments show deviations from normality) and 
non-stationary, which means that their statistical properties such as the mean, 
variance or autocovariance change through time (e.g. in finance where co-dependence 
structure of markets is known to change in times of financial crises). Often, time series 
data arise as complex objects such as curves (e.g. yield curves). New theories and 
methods are needed to handle these new settings.

The proposed research will break new ground in the analysis of non-stationary,
high-dimensional and curve-valued time series. Although many of the problems we 
propose to tackle are motivated by financial applications, our solutions will be 
transferable to other fields. In particular, we will

(i) re-define the way in which people think of non-stationarity. We will define 
(non-)stationarity to be a problem-dependent, rather than `fixed' property of time 
series, and propose new statistical model selection procedures in accordance with 
this new point of view. This will lead to the concept of (non-)stationarity being
put to much better use in solving practical problems (such as forecasting) than
it so far has been;

(ii) propose new, problem-dependent dimensionality reduction procedures for time 
series which are both high-dimensional and non-stationary (dimensionality reduction
is useful in practice as low-dimensional time series are much easier to handle). We 
hope that this problem-dependent approach will induce a completely new way of 
thinking of high-dimensional time series data and high-dimensional data in general;

(iii) propose new methods for statistical model selection in high-dimensional time series 
regression problems, including the non-stationary setting. Our new methods will be 
useful in fields such as financial forecasting or statistical market research;

(iv) investigate new methods for statistical model selection in high-dimensional time 
series (of, e.g., financial returns) in which the dependence structure changes in an 
abrupt fashion due to `shocks', e.g. macroeconomic announcements;

(v) propose new multiscale time series models, specifically designed to solve a long-
standing problem in finance of consistent modelling of financial returns on multiple 
time scales, e.g. intraday and interday;

(vi) propose new ways of analysing time series of curves (e.g. yield curves) which 
can be non-stationary in a variety of ways.

Overall, this is a comprehensive and ambitious research programme, which aims to
offer novel solutions to some of the most important questions in modern time series
analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We see the following groups as the key non-academic beneficiaries of the 
proposed research:

* Risk managers and finance practitioners, such as quantitative analysts 
employed in banks and trading firms.

The proposed research will benefit this group by leading to the creation of 
new methodologies and software for tasks such as the modelling and 
forecasting of financial returns, risk management and portfolio allocation, 
particularly in `difficult' (non-stationary and high-dimensional) situations. 
The PI has a record of impact in the finance industry: (a) his pre-2008 
methodologies for volatility estimation were implemented and used by a 
world-leading commodity trading advisor; (b) he currently advises two 
start-up trading firms, `John Street Capital' and `Research in Action', 
regarding trading strategies based on multiscale and change-point-induced 
modelling of financial returns, related to the proposed research.

* Time series statisticians employed in industry and statistical consultants.

Our new time series methodologies will also be of interest to the community 
of time series statisticians as a whole, in particular those engaged in 
`predictive analytics', where high-dimensional time series regressions, such 
as those studied in the proposed research, are commonplace. Again, the PI 
has a record of impact in this community: his 2012 consultancy project for 
BrandScience, a business analytics company, used non-stationary time series 
regressions, based on the PI's existing research.

In addition, the proposed research will offer benefits in `skills creation' by 
providing high-end training to two postdoctoral researchers employed on this 
project in the following fields: (a) modern methods and techniques of 
mathematical statistics, (b) computer coding in R and C++ and (c) concepts 
and methods of financial statistics and time series analysis. Towards the end
of their tenure, the two researchers will be employable not only in academia, 
but also in the (broadly understood) `data analytics' industry.

In summary, the following `typologies' of non-academic impact 
(http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/impacts/TypologyofResearchImpacts.pdf)
will be achieved by the proposed research (more details in the Pathways to
Impact).

* &amp;quot;Influencing and informing practitioners and professional practice''

* &amp;quot;Enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses and 
organisations''

* &amp;quot;Contributing toward wealth creation and economic prosperity i.e. (...) enhancing 
business revenue and innovative capacity''

* &amp;quot;Training of skilled people for non-academic professions.''</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1044886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have led to the creation of three publicly available statistical software packages in the R programming language: wbs, wbsts and novelist.
