VEMS is a nascent technique that uses phase-plates to modulate the plane-wave beam of a standard electron microscope into a helical wavefront, the vorticity of which establishes orbital angular momentum in the microscope's probe. Unlike the well-studied orbital angular momentum states of light - the vortex's electronic charge imbues a tunable and quantised magnetic moment that provides a completely unexplored degree of freedom for diffraction and spectroscopy within the electron microscope. Thus far, international research has focused on the production of free electron vortex beams. My aim is to explore the interaction of these beams with samples developed during my fellowship. VEMS is intriguing principally because the new magnetic degree of freedom may impart sensitivity to magnetic and chiral media in scattering and diffraction, thereby enabling the study of material properties that have previously only been accessible at international x-ray or neutron facilities. For example, VEMS could yield unprecedented insight into magnetic and charge ordering at oxide interfaces and confer a genuine world lead in the characterisation of these technologically-relevant materials. In addition, I will explore the new direction of applying VEMS to the study of plasmonic metamaterials - devices with wide-ranging applications including bio-sensing and electromagnetic camouflage. The helical nature of the VEMS probe is expected to couple strongly to chiral electric fields established within metamaterials, producing a unique, spatially resolved characterisation tool that will yield new insights into metamaterial design. The project has the triple prospects of providing a new avenue of research, improving my international reputation and substantially enhancing our understanding of the materials already being explored in my fellowship. It capitalises on notable advantages in infrastructure and expertise at the University of Glasgow and will build new collaborative opportunities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO?

The present application is designed to capitalise on recent experimental advances and also to respond to a growing need for nanoscale functional metrology that has been highlighted by my own fellowship research and which chimes with industrial need. Ultimately, it is advances in experimental techniques that drive progress in the majority of nanosciences and so the potential end-users of the proposed research are numerous; however, I will target specifically materials scientists and industrialists working in the areas of advanced oxide and metamaterials. 

HOW?

Industry: The Glasgow Materials and Condensed Matter Physics group has a good track record in industrial engagement and is frequently approached for its expertise in microscopy and materials analysis, especially in magnetic media. These existing collaborations will be used to ensure industrial relevance and will inform exploitation of developments in (i) materials and devices and (ii) methodology and development of the VEMS technique. Knowledge Transfer activities will be handled with the assistance the University's Nanotechnology Officer and the University of Glasgow's Impact Acceleration Account, which provides a flexible and responsive source of funding to maximise the realisation of impact from our EPSRC portfolio. The University of Glasgow prides itself of having pioneered a flexible approach to the management of IP which has now been adopted by a number of leading HEIs in the UK and is known under the name of Easy Access IP (http://www.easyaccessip.org.uk/). This scheme reflects our commitment to make it easy for industry to engage, build mutually rewarding and long lasting partnerships and maximise the uptake of our research by industry so that the impact to society and the economy can be fully realised.

Academic Community: Traditional dissemination activities will be augmented by new collaborations, facilitated by visits to other institutions, inward and outward invited talks, etc. Collaborative aspects are essential to maximising the impact of this new direction on my personal career trajectory and I have already initiated dialogue with some of the pioneers of the field including Verbeeck (Antwerp) and McMorran (NIST, USA) and existing funds will be used to enable bilateral exchange visits to their laboratories. This application gives opportunity to work in new research fields of optics and metamaterials, the latter of which is an EPSRC priority area and therefore forms a sensible new research strand. 

Education &amp;amp; Outreach: The project will help support undergraduate project students, a doctoral student and a PDRA. I will continue to incorporate research material into my lecturing and will participate in the highly-successful Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique scheme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>244186</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meet the Expert @ Glasgow Science Centre</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD1878B5-69EA-4F40-AC5E-08C01266CFFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We had a stall within the science centre with visual displays, handouts, videos and working microscopes.
