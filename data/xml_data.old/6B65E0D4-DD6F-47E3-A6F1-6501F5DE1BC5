Violence</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L014971/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Violent incidents make up nearly a quarter of crimes recorded in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. The effects are not just those of emotional and physical harm to the individual victim but spread much wider in terms of the impact on healthcare, cost to the criminal justice system, lost working hours, and a societal fear of crime. Unlike acquisitive crimes the motive (and therefore appropriate preventive mechanisms) is arguably less apparent. As such, it is important to identify those changes in personal security and routine activities which can be associated with trends in violence. No systematic research studies have been undertaken to assess the protective impact of these factors in relation to acquaintance and stranger violence, examined separately, to date. The research proposed is precisely concerned with such an assessment. The primary research question is: 

What is the role of population group- and context- specific changes in personal security and routine activities in explaining the decline in stranger and acquaintance violence?

This study will identify the personal security and routine activities measures that offer effective protection from violence and repeat violence to (a) the population overall; (b) specific population subgroups according to their socio-economic attributes; (c) the residents of different areas; and (d) area types and population subgroups plausible combinations in England and Wales and internationally over time.

The urgency to gain insights about violence prevention cannot be exaggerated: at a time of massive public spending cuts and increasing austerity measures, the cost of violence to the UK economy is estimated at &amp;pound;13 billion annually (National Audit Office 2008). 

The proposed research will: 
- Make a major scientific contribution with immediate and high societal and economic impact. Its theoretical and methodological advancements will inform future research developments in criminology. The current gap in knowledge impdes violence reduction opportunities not just in the UK but across the world. 
- Engage throughout with high level research users in the public sector and civil society organisations and inform national and international guidelines on violence prevention. 
- Analyse two decades of formidable existing data sources, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), both in the public domain, to allow creative and imaginative application and data linking via comparative work. The CSEW is a large and complex dataset with currently some 40,000 respondents annually. The ICVS is a unique comparative crime data partly funded and organised by the Home Office. Yet relative to both data generation cost and their impeccable quality, they have been extremely under-explored.
- Employ innovative research methodology and application in criminology. This includes the Security Impact Assessment Tool and multivariate multilevel logit modelling, pioneered by the co-applicants with ESRC support for assessing the effectiveness of burglary and car security devices and examining the effect of context on the relation between burglary risk and security, respectively; multilevel negative binomial modelling, pioneered by the P-I with American Statistical Association and Home Office support for investigating the effect of context on single and repeat victimisation patterns; and hurdle models which show whether repeat victims differ from others. 
- Engage non-academic partners, the national charity Victim Support and the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership, to triangulate findings, access further data, and ensure direct applicability of findings to victims of violent crime.
- Benefit from collaboration with International Co- Investigators.

Therefore the proposed research fits the ESRC-SDAI Phase 2 call specification. The co-applicants' theoretical, methodological and policy contribution to date ensure its successful delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Violent crime has far reaching social and economic costs - to individuals, local communities, and society in general. This research has been designed to inform future policy guidelines in ways that could lead to considerable financial savings and produce direct benefits to the following groups:
- Victims and repeat victims of violent crime, by informing them of how best to reduce their future risks
- All adults, by informing them of effective personal security measures and violence avoidance behavioural adaptations
- Victim Support as a national charity, by improving their evidence base and analysing their data to enable them to provide a more effective and cost efficient service
- Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership in particular and Crime Reduction Partnerships in general, working more effectively and efficiently to discharge their responsibilities 
- Businesses which are affected either directly or indirectly by violent crimes, by informing them how best to contribute to reduction of risks and thus improve security for their staff and customers, and by enabling victims to return to work sooner, respectively.
- The insurance industry, by enabling them to offer incentives for individuals who actively seek to reduce their risk of violence by taking effective security measures
- The security industry, by enabling them to improve products of personal security and better target them according to clients' socio-economic and area profiles 
- Public information by suggesting improvements to the personal security questions of the Crime Prevention Module of the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and the International Crime Victims Survey and to the routine activities questions of both surveys; and
- Public policy by informing on violence reduction in private and public spheres 

In an indirect way the proposed research will also benefit: 
- The police, by reducing workloads (and thus costs) through reduced violent crimes and by enabling more informed advice to be given to victims and the wider community
- The NHS, by reducing the pressure from violent crime on accident and emergency services
- The society at large, by reducing violence and its impact; 
- The economy, via increased productivity (reducing work days lost as a result of violence)

Public engagement for the duration of the proposed research has been planned to maximise its impact to all research users groups (see Pathways to Impact). In addition the Project Partners will be actively involved in the development and dissemination of the research throughout its duration via their in-kind support in data provision, research planning, interpretation of findings with respect to their policy implications and writing up draft policy outputs (see Letters of Support, Pathways to Impact, Case for Support and Project Partners).

As seen in their respective CVs members of the research team already enjoy close contacts with and serve in bodies responsible for crime measurement and prevention. They are thus accustomed to communicating findings to non-specialists in ways that draw out their policy and practice significance. Past work has already had a substantial impact. Farrell's work on repeat victimisation has found its way into routine policy and practice. Grove's recent work on heritage crime has received substantial media coverage. Tseloni's work has played a pivotal part in official reports of crime statistics and patterns. Tilley wrote the original guidance for analysis for the Crime and Disorder Act (Hough and Tilley 1998) and his work on problem-oriented policing and partnership has had a substantial impact on the work of local police services and partnerships. The findings of the team's past ESRC-funded work (ES/F015186/1) have received substantial media coverage and informed Home Office publications on crime trends. Their current ESRC- funded work (ES/K003771/1) is presently informing burglary target hardening policy interventions in Nottingham.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151091</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Northampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EMPAC Local and Community Policing Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>24D744C9-D6C8-4EEA-9FB1-43487E614A8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A list of conference presentations and research reports on:

The public and voluntary sector organisations which contributed to the project via the AC included the following:

? Life-skills Education, C.I.C. (a voluntary organisation delivering programmes enhancing young people's resilience in problem solving and communication skills); 
? The Home Office, the Crime Statistics and Violence and Early Offending Units;
? Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership (NCDP); and
? Office for National Statistics, who received feedback on BCS/CSEW questionnaire design improvements for gauging additional information on security, guardianship and violence victimisation nationally.

Victim Support for Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland, which was committed to the project at the time of application for funding, however was not part of the project in the end because it had ceased to exist. 

In addition to the Advisory Committee of Stakeholders and Experts (see above) the project team employed the following collaborative and engagement mechanisms:

? Briefing Notes, Summary Reports and Press Releases;
? Twitter account (@project_vio) and project's dedicated website for continuous postings/opinion exchanges; 
? Radio/TV interviews, newspaper postings, articles in practitioners newsletters and magazines; and
? Presenting findings in (non-academic) practitioners/policy national and international conferences.

Details can be found in the Portfolio of outcomes section on Researchfish. 

The research has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy via cost-effective crime prevention, enhance quality of life via crime and fear of crime reduction, and contributed to improving the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom via promoting safe night-time economy activities.

The study generated significant new knowledge on short trends of violence victimisation by strangers and by acquaintances (defined as just to speak to casually; just by sight, neighbour, workmate; work colleague, client; members of public contacted through work, friend; and acquaintance, local children) and individuals' routine activities in England and Wales. Stranger and acquaintance violence trends were further differentiated between those with and without wounding, against males and females and across age groups for the above period. 

This study found that both stranger and acquaintance violence fell between 2010/11 and 2013/14. The two violence types were very similar with regards to annual number of crimes, victimisation risk (although that by strangers slightly exceeded risk by acquaintances) and over-time changes from 2010/11 to 2013/14. Violence without wounding and / or against young people 16-24 years old is most common for both crime types. Although most victims of acquaintance and stranger violence are men, the differences between the two sexes tends to diminish over time, especially with regards to acquaintance violence. The most common precautionary behaviours include (a) using only licensed cabs, (b) avoiding walking through certain areas or types of places and (b) keeping property out of sight. However, with the exception of the above, there was no marked increase in the proportion of people who adopted precautionary behaviours during the 2011-2014 violence fall. The situational characteristics of acquaintance and stranger violence have remained stable over-time: Most violence by strangers is perpetrated when dark outside, in and around pub or outside home and under the influence of alcohol but roughly equal proportion of victims being alone are attacked by strangers or acquaintances.

The findings opened up new research questions: What are the longer term trends? What is the effect of data weighting and/or Home Office and subsequently ONS procedures of incident truncation on stranger and acquaintance violence trends? Was the fall in violence crime rate due to fewer victims or less crimes per victim (and repeat victimisation)? How routine activities may have influenced long term violence falls?

New research networks were formed with researchers from the University of Lancaster who examine domestic violence trends. 
The methodology for calculating Security Protection Factors (SPFs) for routine activities to gauge their effectiveness in avoiding violence was explored. After assessing the extent to which SPFs are meaningful in the context of human behaviour (rather than security devices) and/or whether a CSEW-based calculation is feasible over time the team concluded that this methodology cannot be applied to routine activities. Therefore this research path was closed off.
Finally new research skills and capability were developed from familiarising the hired Research Staff with the UK Data Service archives and procedures, and training her to analyse multiple large and challenging data sets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Together with results from the second part of the project undertaken at Nottingham Trend University the findings can be taken forward via:

The CSIAT, the methodology developed during this project, entails calculating the SPF's of security combinations based on the population group- and area- specific burglary and security odds ratios which are estimated via BMLM. Thus the population groups and contexts for which lack of security is associated with the highest burglary risk can be identified.
