Fortunately, a new class of 'immune modulating drugs' has been recently developed. These work by removing the defences the tumour develops to protect it from the body's normal immune system, exposing it to attack by the body's immune cells.

The only means currently to predict whether these drugs will work is to assess the amount of a protein called PD-L1 on the tumour cells. Unfortunately, this particular 'biomarker' lacks accuracy; some patients who should respond do not and some patients who have little/no PD-L1 would probably respond but are missing out on this treatment. 

Our study will examine why PD-L1 lacks precision by looking at how it varies between different parts of the tumour and areas of tumour spread, how it relates to inflammation and genetic mutations, and how all of these inter-relate. Ultimately, we wish to improve the accuracy of determining whether an individual patient with lung cancer will respond to these drugs, so that the most beneficial treatment can be given in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>PLAN OF INVESTIGATION

Phase 1

Archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are available from 651 resected specimens of NSCLC and are consented for research purposes. Of these, 156 have accompanying, involved, regional (intrathoracic) lymph nodes. Standard immunohistochemical analysis will determine the expression levels and heterogeneity of PD-L1 in tumour and immune cells and the nature of the immune cell populations within the tumour. The presence of EGFR gene mutations and ALK gene rearrangement will be determined where not known. 

Phase 2

There are various options locally available for analysis of extracted genetic material. This field is constantly updating in techniques and panels of genes to be targeted. However the use of cutting-edge technology such as NGS-panels, Nanostring and MassArray has been ascertained as feasible with this tissue by discussing with the respective teams and companies. The specific panels may update to reflect the changing environment, but these can be used to assess TMB, immune profiling, actionable mutations and so on. Validation of techniques, including the minimum amount of genetic material required for sufficient analysis, will be performed and can be combined with approaches for minimal sampling, including laser-capture microscopy (LCM) and needle core biopsy. 

Phase 3

This phase will mostly concentrate on working with Eli Lilly (see part B3b) and local oncologists for access to tissue samples after immune checkpoint therapy. Patients who fail immune checkpoint therapy are the primary group of interest and both post-therapy and archival tissue can be assessed for inherent and de novo resistance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R016909/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
