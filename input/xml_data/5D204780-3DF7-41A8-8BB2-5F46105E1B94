At the end of these visits, all the parties were fully committed to working together, as part of the MOTIV project, with the main objective of improving our understanding of railway induced ground vibration.

All parties involved agreed to collaborate with each other.

In particular it has been established that it is important to include the two rails separately at higher frequencies but that they can be considered together at low frequencies. The effect of the train movement has also been determined.
The nonlinear behaviour of rail fasteners has been quantified through laboratory tests. The effect of this nonlinear behaviour on the vibration of the track and ground has been assessed using theoretical models.
Simple models for piled foundations have been developed and compared with more complex models.
The models have been implemented in fast-running software for predicting ground vibration due to railways. This includes surface railways and tunnels, including twin-tunnels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The software will be made available to the industry although not as freeware.
