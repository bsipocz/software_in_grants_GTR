Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J004499/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Hillforts are the most impressive field legacy from the Iron Age across many areas of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Eire. Although precision is not possible, it is likely that there are over 4000 in Ireland and Britain. Any academic or popular account of later prehistory from c. 1000 BC has to include a discussion of hillforts as the dominant monument type: their forms and architecture, possible functions, relationships with their setting and archaeological surroundings. Over recent years within Iron Age studies the importance of 'regionalisation' has emerged again as an important theme and one which requires information and data to be available at both the local level and at regional and inter-regional scales. There is no integrated system that will provide this information for hillforts, although a wide variety of sources exist in digital and paper form. These sources however are diverse, often difficult to access, and hard to integrate to produce wider interpretations and new research questions, since all previous syntheses have generally been at 'national' (i.e. Ireland, England) scales. Furthermore, most of the ways in which these sites are usually described are based on upstanding examples, but it is now essential to incorporate many ploughed-down remains, only visible as cropmarks, into understandings of these sites.

This project will create an online interactive database that will include standardised information on all hillforts in the UK and Eire and enable interrogation and analysis at a range of scales from an individual hillfort to the whole collection. The database will be linked to Google Earth/Maps so that the locations of hillforts can be seen within their landscape contexts. At the close of the project, the data file will be available for re-use in a variety of software. The information held will be a compilation of all existing sources, re-structured to provide maximum achievable consistency and the ability to search all hillforts, evaluating and comparing them on meaningful characteristics such as number and configuration of ramparts, ditches and entrances. Evaluation, analysis and interpretation will take place at local, regional and inter-regional scales and the outcomes will be a paper atlas of hillforts, where cartographic presentation will be matched by succinct analytical texts. These will include extensive discussion on the structuring of the data, including consideration of what is and is not a hillfort and why, together with the interpretation of analyses and patterns established at the different scales and visualised through a series of maps and plans. The results will feed significantly into discussions of regionality and how hillforts fit with other data and interpretations. This work will be mirrored by a critical re-assessment of the dating evidence for these sites, including isotopic and other scientific determinations, numismatic and artefactual data, and documentary sources: these monuments are used in both the first millennia BC and AD, and evaluation of the chronological range of these sites at a variety of scales will allow closer readings of patterns through time, to match the spatial focus highlighted above. The analysis of this set of sites across the whole of Britain and Ireland - something not previously-attempted - will generate new configurations of information on similarities and differences amongst sites that will challenge prevailing views.

Hillforts are of great interest to a large range of audiences, sometimes just for their intrinsic archaeological value but often as part of wider landscape, historical and environmental interests. Further to encourage the breadth of this participation, the database will be configured as a hillfort-wiki, capable of accepting user-generated content so that additional text and images can be attached to any hillfort, separately from the core data generated by the project,</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A wide range of users outside the academic community will benefit from this research. The results will be fed back into the publicly-accessible national monuments records of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Eire, so that they will all have an enhanced resource to make available to their wide range of clients. This will include more information than present systems contain and be more useable for research-type queries based on characteristics of the monuments. All of these record systems are widely consulted for a range of reasons from development control and related interests within the planning system through to public interest; and the data researched, calibrated and standardized during this project would be a core part of that resource. This enhancement of the resource also links with the private and professional heritage sectors, including archaeological consultants and contractors, who use these resources for desk-based assessments and other purposes in the applied world of 'polluter-pays' archaeology. The integration of 'cropmark' data from the lowland arable zones will represent a particular enhancement to be offered by this project. The aim is to make the final data available as a file that can be re-used within a range of software and, therefore, be as widely accessible as possible.

Policy makers, for example state heritage organizations, National Trusts, National Parks and local authorities, will be interested in this resource especially because it will include (separately and identifiably) user generated content, i.e. information from various specialists and input by the general public. With the current interest in public participation in heritage and landscape management this will provide an important source for opinions concerning hillforts and their place in peoples' lives and communities.

Hillforts of various forms are an international phenomenon occurring over large areas of Europe from the Iberian peninsular to east-central Europe. Britain and Ireland however possess one of the longest- and best-studied data-sets, and some of the most innovative approaches to this suite of sites, so that the standardisation that this portal will offer will be international in its significance. Beneficiaries of this research would include the Iron Age academic archaeological and heritage communities from Spain and Portugal eastwards, for all of whom sites equivalent to insular hillforts are an important key to the comprehension of the regional Iron Ages. 

In many areas of rural Britain and Ireland, tourism and associated recreation for example in the form of hill-walking helps underpin local economies. There are numerous cases from the south coast of England to the northern Highlands and west to the Dingle peninsula, of conspicuous or reasonably-preserved hill-forts being targets for such recreational use. By making accessible information on these sites, it is hoped that this project may simultaneously encourage responsible tourism and the sustainability of these key monuments whilst also disseminating information about them that helps to distributes visits to them around more examples, thereby deflecting potential damage from footfall at some 'honeypot' sites, while also encouraging enjoyment and educational use of these important monuments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>782085</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Monuments Records</gtr:description><gtr:id>13D691EC-1BA1-4E08-B214-77F967AE7EB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project will input data to the National Sites and Monuments Records as detailed above.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5f03b1f082.91722237-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The National Monument Records as detailed above either directly or (in the case of Ireland) through our collaboration with Professor W O'Brien, UC Cork, provided support and guidance for the Project in the process of data acquisition and assessment with particular reference to their own holdings..

The project is keen for the data to be re-used in as many ways as possible as it will be the most detailed and complete dataset on hillforts in existence. The potential of this as a research tool has been shown through the work of Simon Maddison for his MSc dissertation (GIS and Spatial Analysis at UCL). Using downloaded Atlas data Simon has used a spatial analytical technique called Percolation Analysis to investigate the spatial distribution of hillforts and the possibilities of there being spatial groupings among them. Simon's work will be reported by him at the Project final conference scheduled for June 23rd-25th.

The Project has worked in close association with national and local data repositories, mainly National Monuments Records and regional Historic Environment Records. The data they provided has been restructured and considerably enhanced in a variety of ways The Project will provide all data suppliers with a csv copy of the database which they can re-use in whatever way is appropriate for their needs and systems.

An important component of the Project has been its Citizen Science programme whereby individuals and groups have been encouraged and supported to survey hillforts in the field. A Survey Form with Notes for Guidance was developed and made available through an early Project website. Considerable publicity surrounded the launch including being on the BBC News website, several local radio stations and national publications (with international interest in e.g. Der Speigel, Germany) . Team members gave over 40 talks and training sessions to local archaeological societies and other groups. In total 305 surveys were returned (84% in England) along with a wealth of ancillary information such as photographs, plans and unpublished writings. This information was checked against the formal data in the database and incorporated as appropriate. One major outcome of the Citizen Science is that the Chilterns AONB Board, who co-ordinated several groups to carry out surveys, have submitted a major HLF application to work on the 21 hillforts in their area based on the work with the Atlas.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CAE6E6AA-CC81-40BC-9413-CEB8F2FF2833</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c33a0c57b9f8.66366436</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Drawing on a wide variety of published and online resources and archives, and supplemented by limited ground-truthing of the field evidence, the project team has collected data on some 4110 individual sites considered to be hillforts. This exercise has involved the team in standardising information produced by the application of a range of different recording methods and schemes of description across five countries (Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland) which all have somewhat divergent systems of data recording and structuring, hindering the identification of broader-scale comparisons and patterning in the.characteristics of these sites.

A major effort has gone into building a complex database to enable the project team to capture the extreme diversity apparent in these sites from the Northern Isles of Scotland and the Atlantic coastlands of Ireland south to the hinterland of the English Channel and efforts are now under way to identify, characterize, map and evaluate a wide range of the characteristics of such sites across Britain and Ireland. These will be presented at a public conference to be held in Edinburgh in June 2017 and shall also be incorporated into a paper Atlas which is now being assembled. Overall, the Project team will be able to produce new interpretations of the spatial distributions of hillforts based on a range of their key characteristics in ways which have not previously been possible, including consideration of the changes to their configurations through time. The outcomes will modify perspectives on hillforts which have largely been considered as a set across Britain and Ireland in terms of their current appearance and form, by taking into consideration their evolution through time (where this is known). The Atlas maps will replace maps for Britain that in large measure still depend on 1960s data made available through the Ordnance Survey, and will demonstrate locally significant distributions of this category of monuments in areas of eastern Britain where the essence of the evidence is conserved as cropmark archaeology (which has here been integrated into our database) and a more widespread scatter of sites in such topographic settings within the zone of likely destruction of archaeological sites as upstanding monuments. Elsewhere, at least locally, the application of standard thresholds in terms of areal extent, scale of enclosure and topographic setting for the acceptance of sites as hillforts has produced moderate declines in the number of retained sites, notably in some western regions (e.g. Cornwall, Pembrokeshire). For the first time, at least for larger size cohorts (over 1ha in extent; a residual problem concerns the 60k-strong series of raths and ringworks in Ireland) it is now possible to map Irish distributions alongside those for the British mainland, including juxtaposing evidence for certain categories of sites (notably coastal promontory forts) traditionally considered entirely separately in different archaeological traditions. While certain special characteristics of limited number of hillforts (e.g. the presence of guard chambers in their entrance-works) have long been mapped and discussed as a set, the data assembled by the Project Team means that many more attributes of these sites (e.g. styles of enclosure architecture and details thereof) can now be mapped and examined as sets of evidence, 

We were also able to initiate and in some measure directly support a successful and innovative Citizen Science campaign that connected large numbers of the general public with hillforts in a critical way by facilitating them to submit data which has enriched the project and which has contributed to allowing certain amateur groups further to develop their interests in hillforts, to the extent of seeking additional funds from other sources (e.g. Heritage Lottery Fund) to take forward research on local series of such sites. 

We are also in course of finalising a webmapping application that will enable the project to make its complex dataset freely available via Oxford University to a range of users from the general public to specialist researchers. This application is designed to enable such users in future to build queries, to export data, and to interact spatially with hillfort information contained in maps and satellite imagery.

The Project organised a very successful conference in collaboration with the Department for Continuing Education of Oxford University in late 2015 which brought together the general public and hillfort experts to discuss the latest findings and ideas on a variety of topics concerning hillforts including their dating and distribution. A further conference is scheduled for Edinburgh University on 23-25 June 2017 which will revisit and extend the 2015 themes through presentations and extended discussion sessions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are numerous ways in which the results of this project can be taken forward - this was always one of the intentions. The information we have collated will be freely available via data downloads from the webmapping application and/or from the Archaeological Data Service at York University, or indirectly via the National Monuments Records of the individual countries within Britain and Ireland and/or the Historic Environment Records of the local authorities. New analyses will be able to be carried out and interpretations can be carried out by anyone in and beyond tertiary education and indeed professional archaeological employment. Our georeferenced data will be available to compare and contrast with other suites of information in ways that could not be done before, and which will in future be able to take overviews and understanding of hillforts beyond the new synthesis that will be contained in the Atlas now under way.. Integration with wikimedia will allow the future deposition of digital images of hillforts, indexed by atlas number, by members of the public and professional archaeologists.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BBF43057-7D5C-4AE9-B4B0-5CF6FB30A550</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c335aa875758.43858909</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advisory Board membership, Scottish Archaeological Research Framework, Regional Frameworks under auspices of Soceity of Antiquaries of Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAF8F9EC-F401-485A-8E1E-D1C3114DE220</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b4468cec44e0.49450993</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>For data collection the team used an online database built in FileMaker Pro v11 to enable dispersed data entry.

The original intention was to convert this database to an open public version and link it to Google Earth as an important outcome of the project. However, the School of Archaeology, Oxford, has recently invested in a map server and is developing a series of ESRI WebMapping applications for large projects. This web-based GIS mapping will enable more powerful real-time mapping and spatial visualisation of the Atlas data together with powerful searching functionality. The results of searches can be as reports, .pdfs and csv files. It is hoped to be able to develop a mobile version of this with GPS functionality so that proximity to individual hillforts can be determined and appropriate data accessed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>175C015E-A603-4CFD-8F37-83F6133AF752</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See answers to other questions re: giving public access to the data we have collected and sifted. 
The database will be archived with the Archaeology Data Service and will be accessible through that service.
 Data will also be lodged with the relevant national heritage agencies' historic environment services (e.g. Historic England, Historic Environment Scotland) and will be incorporated into their records.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6f1b978af89.99311099</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Atlas of Hillforts of Britain and Ireland database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Webmapping application will be a powerful research tool that will enable researchers to download filtered data taken from the project's main database in csv format which they can then use in a variety of software applications.
Wikipedia is often a first port-of-call for people beginning research in a new topic - the Atlas pages (one per hillfort) will be a useful tool that provides information and references for each site plus a link to the Webmapping database.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C6AA00C-76D6-484F-A942-63606C1566A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the time of writing, this is still in development, following the completion of data inputting for the main project database.
