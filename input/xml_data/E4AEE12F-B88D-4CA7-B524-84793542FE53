Although a fundamental part of everyday health care, technologies of wound care are often considered mundane and are consequently overlooked in both academic literature and medical practice. This project will bring together academic and non-academic audiences, developing cross-disciplinary engagement in an exploratory project on the interplay between histories and current practices of advanced wound care. Through three workshops the goal is to identify how an awareness and appreciation of the historical approaches and sociological discussions surrounding wound care innovation can inform current practices in a number of ways: by illuminating in more detail the manufacturer-user relationship, analysing conditions under which innovation thrive, and highlighting how particular types of product were marketed to consumers. There has been limited engagement in this field between research communities in the health sciences and humanities. In addition, the patient voice has been notably absent in discussions about research in wound care (Cullum et al, in press). The project offers a fresh interdisciplinary approach which builds on pilot work undertaken at the University of Leeds and lays the foundation for a major interdisciplinary project exploring the history and impact of advanced wound care.

Whilst much research has examined the historical context of acute surgical wounds and injuries sustained on the battlefield, the case of chronic wounds has yet to be fully investigated. In the UK, most chronic wounds are managed by community nurses with referral to specialist services, including tissue viability, surgical specialties (e.g. vascular and orthopaedic surgery), podiatry and dermatology. The historical literature has tended to concentrate on hospital-based, acute clinical activity, ignoring the fact that wound care decision making, prevention and treatment is very often the preserve of nursing as well as patients themselves. Similarly, recent historical research has emphasised the importance of global conflict in driving innovations which are applicable in far broader settings; inventions emerging from warfare are appropriated and applied in many different and unexpected ways beyond the immediate field of conflict. 

The work of George Winter (1962), observing that wounds in young pigs healed more quickly if covered rather than being left open to the air, is the starting point for much contemporary wounds research because it established the idea that a wound dressing can influence outcomes. The theoretical context of the work will therefore bring together historical and sociological case studies of innovation and the established historical methodological approach of the 'medical marketplace', as well as recent research on the history of medical technology and everyday healthcare. This will shed new light on Rogers' (2003) influential work on diffusion of innovation and Greenhalgh et al's (2004) systematic review findings that successful innovation adoption requires analysis of the characteristics of the innovation itself, the perceptions of those individuals tasked with adopting the innovation, and the wider organisational cultures in place in the setting for adoption.

The project will connect academics from a broad range of disciplines with patient and industry representatives to explore how historically-grounded accounts of advanced wound care can address current challenges in the field. To this end, major outputs will include an edited collection based on the outcomes of the workshops, an industry-facing briefing document, a public panel debate, creative visual outputs and a new network of interdisciplinary scholars which will be supported in the longer-term by digital resources.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network workshops will examine creative responses to contemporary and historical aspects of risk in innovation, bringing together academics and health professionals to examine with patients, carers and members of industry, the historical and sociological development of 'advanced' wound care in the UK and major challenges faced by the sector. We will engage with groups throughout the project, and the principal beneficiaries will be:

1. The medical industry and healthcare professionals
Representatives from the medical industry will be invited to all three project workshops. This will capitalise on our successful existing collaboration with James Lavan (a member of the project's Advisory Group) and Mark Richardson VP Research and Technology at Smith&amp;amp;Nephew, and we will expand our invitation through the Association of British Healthcare Industries to include both international and local medical manufacturing firms, such as De Puy Synthes and Medasil (Surgical) Ltd., with whom Co-I Stark has previously collaborated through an AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship (2011-12).
We will work closely with our project partner, the National Institute for Health Research WoundTec Healthcare Technology Co-operative (NIHR WoundTec HTC) to help them realise their core goal of 'improving quality of life for patients through the rapid translation of ideas and technologies in wound prevention and treatment' (http://www.woundtec.htc.nihr.ac.uk/about-us). In particular, engaging the NIHR WoundTec HTC in discussions around the historical context of wound care has the potential for impact on current practices in their four key focus areas: diagnostics, infection detection and treatment, wound prevention and support surfaces, and co-design strategies. 

2. Patients/service users
There is a growing body of evidence showing a mismatch between the health research that patients want to see happen and the research that is actually being carried out. We will work closely with patients/service users and carers in the design and delivery of this interdisciplinary wound care research project in order to focus the advanced wound care research agenda on the social and clinical outcomes that matter most to them. This network will therefore ensure that future research and professional practice improves patient experience, leaving a lasting impact on everyday wound care.

3. Museum and heritage organisations
The workshops will take place at the Thackray Medical Museum and will use objects and texts from the museum's collection to facilitate discussion. The project therefore has the potential to give added value to the Thackray's collections and provide additional context to their upcoming programme of events through their major HLF project, Healthy Future. Broader impact will be guaranteed for the medical museum community though the Thackray's leading role in the Medical Museum Subject Specialist Network and UK Medical Collections Group. This will ensure that dissemination is as wide as possible and that the project is responsive to the needs and agendas of medical heritage practitioners and audiences.

4. Public audiences
The experience of wound care falls as much in the domain of the domestic and everyday as in that of professional medicine and healthcare. We will therefore work with public audiences in the UK to generate interest in and dialogue around comparative work globally. Wider audiences will be invited to contribute to project discussions and outputs and to explore the public image of wound care. A public panel debate at the project mid-point, as well as ongoing, public digital content arising from the workshops, will allow for two-way exchange and enable major themes emerging from this discussion to feed into planning for the final workshop and subsequent programmes of research. This will ensure that that project's research and impact plans remain flexible and responsive to the needs of the widest possible non-academic community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23805</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N006267/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BECA85F-CCD1-43D9-9B33-FFDFF6377498</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med Soc/Soc Health &amp; Illness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>195B48B4-2BC5-4DEB-BA1A-323A90D8730D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tissue engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
