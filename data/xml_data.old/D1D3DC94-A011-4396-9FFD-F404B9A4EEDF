Forecasting models are developed based on different assumptions about the economic structure and the statistical properties of the macroeconomic data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recently, structural models, called Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, became popular in central banks as a tool to deliver both macroeconomic forecasts and policy analysis. However, the academic literature provides evidence on the shortcomings of these models in predicting the drop in output observed in the recent recession. In contrast, academics have argued that a statistical model, called Dynamic Factor Model, may have being able to predict the severe downturn. Additional competitors recently proposed in the literature are Bayesian Vector Autoregressions and Mixed Data Sampling Models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, little is known about the relative performance of these state-of-art models when forecasting under macroeconomic uncertainty. From the point of view of the economic decision maker, it is hard to ascertain if the most adequate set of forecasting models (or a model) is being used.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main output of this research project is a evaluation of the relative forecasting accuracy of state-of-art macroeconomic forecasting models, including their performance during the recent downturn.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Case of Support mentions the two pathways to impact expected from the implementation of the research project. 
The first one is the impact on the academic literature on forecasting and macroeconometric modelling. The project will produce four research papers aiming at publication in top-area academic journals. The publication of the paper provides evidence of our contribution to the academic literature. By presenting our work in academic conferences, as described in the Justification of Resources, we also aim to disseminate our ideas and results within the academic community. Our previous work in forecasting has been heavily cited and we hope that all four research papers will have an even stronger impact. 
The second impact channel is on institutions that need to release forecasts of macroeconomic variables such as output growth and inflation. In the Case of Support, we mention institutions such as the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility that may benefit from guidance on how to choose a forecasting model. As described in the project timeline, we are planning to write a summary of our main results in a report written in a language adequate for a wider audience of professional economists, and make it available at the Centre for Research in Economics and Finance (CReMFi) website (www.cremfi.econ.qmul.ac.uk). This research summary will provide guidance on how to choose a forecasting model depending on the forecasting horizon, and also uncertainty scenarios that may affect forecasts. 
We are also planning to provide ways of implementing state-of-art models in accessible software packages, such as EVIEWS. By releasing the required implementation software in our website we hope to improve the use of these models by master students and professional economists in the industrial and in institutions all over the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>323311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Macroeconomic forecasts are a key ingredient when making economic policy decisions, including policies to control public deficit and monetary policy. Our main research output, the paper &amp;quot;A comprehensive evaluation of macroeconomic forecasting methods&amp;quot; provides guidance for forecasters on which method to choose depending on the number of economic predictors available and the forecasting horizon. 
The paper has been presented by Ana Galvao in 2015 in the following academic conferences: Glasgow Workshop in Mixed Frequency Models, The European Business Cycle Conference in Forecasting in Oslo, the International Symposium in Forecasting in Riverside, the Computational and Financial Econometrics Conference in London. In 2016, the paper was presented at Department of Economics in Dauphine in Paris, the econometrics workshop in the St Louis Fed, the Conference of the Royal Economic Society in Brighton and the Conference of the International Association of Applied Econometrics in Milan. In all these conferences, central bankers, one of main targets for impact of our research project, were in audience. Specifically, for a Central Bank audience, Ana Galvao presented this research output as a special lecture in the 2015 and the 2016 versions of the &amp;quot;Forecasting for Central Bankers&amp;quot; course organised by the Centre for Central Banking Studies of the Bank of England. The audience in both stances was of around 25 economists working in central banks all over the world. 
Currently, the results of our main paper are having an impact on the way the Bank of England produces internal short-run forecasts (nowcasts). Both Ana Galvao and George Kapetanios are part of the Bank of England steering committee on non-structural models. This committee aims at providing advice on improving the use of non-structural models by economists in the Bank of England. Our initial contribution was on providing advice on developing a new suite of nowcast models, drawing from the results of this research project. This new set of forecasting models provide alternative forecasts to support monetary policy decisions by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy committee. 
Because the main research paper is now well known by the many audiences that attend a presentation of its main findings, we hope we will see soon more evidence, in addition to the Bank of England case, that this research has contributed to improve macroeconomic forecasts in policy-making institutions both in the UK and abroad.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1FCD69AB-D1E8-4529-95EC-244AF86836F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc5604376dd0.20974590</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research supported by this grant has provided us with the following findings. 
(i) Our main research output provides guidance to macroeconomic forecasters, that is, professionals that need to predict the future path of economic activity and inflation. Carriero, Galvao and Kapetanios find that forecasters should use mixed frequency models when nowcasting quarterly output growth and inflation, but for longer forecasting horizons, Bayesian Vector Autoregressive models with quarterly data are preferred. Structural models might be helpful for computing long horizon forecasts of inflation. Enlarging the dataset of economic indicators from a dozen to more than one-hundred variables may improve the computation of predictive densities. Computer code to replicate these empirical outcomes is currently available to anyone at the grant page https://sites.google.com/site/macroforecastingcomparison/home. 
(ii) This research has improved our understanding on the impact of data revisions on forecasting and economic decisions. Galvao shows how to compute forecasts with Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models, which are popular structural modelling approaches in Central Banks, while taking into account that the data employed in the estimation is subject to revision. She shows that our ability to accurately assign probabilities to future values of macroeconomic variables can be improved by considering the impact of data uncertainty. Galvao and Clements have also show how equity markets react to expected future data revisions. 
(iii) Finally, we have created innovative methods to take advantage of the informational content of large datasets of macroeconomic and financial time series while allowing for time variation in the parameters and in the volatility of the shocks. Carriero, Clark and Marcellino show how to model the comovement in the volatility of the shocks in a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive Model of a large set of macroeconomic and financial variables. Kapetanios, Venditti and Marcellino show how to model time variation in the parameters of Vector Autoregressive Models for a large set of variables, and how their modelling approach can improve forecasts and structural analysis. Carriero, Kapetanios and Marcellino propose a new method that improves structural analysis with vector autoregressive models for a large set of variables. 

By providing support for a research assistant, this grant has also improved the training of a Queen Mary University of London PhD student, Katerina Petrova. She wrote three research papers co-authored by Kapetanios, Galvao and Giraitis. These papers propose a novel methodology to model time variation in the coefficients of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models. They improve our understanding of how structural changes may impact on popular macroeconomic modelling approaches, and also how financial shocks affect the macroeconomy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We expect that our research will be taken forward by researchers working on macroeconomic modelling and forecasting. Indeed, some of cited research papers have been already published in top economics journals such as the Journal of Econometrics and the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics. These academic journals are very influential, so we expect that our research will be carried forward by the international academic community. 
We expect that our research will have an impact on how economists in central banks, finance ministers and international organizations compute their macroeconomic forecasts. The Warwick Business School Forecasting System publishes forecasts for UK growth and inflation every quarter (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/subjects/emf/forecasting/). Their forecasting approach relies heavily on the research supported by this research. The &amp;quot;compare macroeconomic forecasting&amp;quot; website developed by the investigators supported by this grant together with Haroon Mumtaz at Queen Mary also draws on the outcomes of this research. The &amp;quot;compare macroeconomic forecasting&amp;quot; website (comparemacroforecasts.org) is a tool that allows anyone to compare the accuracy of forecasts from many state-of-art macroeconomic forecasting models. 
We also expect our research to have an impact on macroeconomic modelling. Petrova and Kapetanios have worked with Massolo and Waldron at the Bank of England in the early part of 2015 to apply the method developed with the support of this grant to model structural changes in the main Bank of England structural macroeconomic model (the COMPASS model).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5F64BBD6-F645-4348-A9D1-5108F4614183</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5671569947feb6.56665688</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/macroforecastingcomparison/home</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We compile a selection of the Matlab codes employed in the working paper &amp;quot;A comprehensive Evaluation of Macroeconomic Forecasting Methods&amp;quot; and made them available with comments on the website :https://sites.google.com/site/macroforecastingcomparison/home</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B4D0D30-0FA9-43BF-8A0B-D54559138B34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The code published was developed to support the paper &amp;quot;A comprehensive Evaluation of Macroeconomic Forecasting Methods&amp;quot;.
