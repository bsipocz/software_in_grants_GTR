The exhibition consisted of 24 Paintings and Drawings by Carline and 50 photographs by Brooks and Brunell, all from the collection of the Imperial War Museum, London, and was held at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art, London (13 January-19 March 2017).
Prior to their exhibition a number of the Carlines required restoration to make them display-worthy.
The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated 92-page catalogue incorporating an essay by military historian Mark Thompson (University of East Anglia) about the British military experience in Italy, November 1917-November 1918 plus two essays by myself: one focusing on Sydney Carline in Italy and the other on Brooks and Brunell as official photographers in Italy, 1917-18.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DD2F712-F6EB-4C7B-8643-928B12F7D641</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition has attracted record visitor numbers for the Collection and has coincided with a spike in membership applications. To date two thirds of the catalogue print run of 1,100 copies have been sold. Furthermore the exhibition has attracted some very positive critical reaction on the radio (Radio 4's 'Front Row' programme) and in the national press with favourable reviews in: The Times, The Sunday Times, The Independent, The Guardian, The Observer, Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, The Times Literary Supplement, The Tablet, The Art Newspaper, Apollo Magazine and the British Journal of Photography.
The Art Department of the IWM, London has reported a distinct rise in interest in Sydney Carline (e-mail and telephone enquiries).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adddf44bc7a4.15700636</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Exhibition: War in the Sunshine: The British In Italy Through The Eyes of Sydney Carline, Ernest Brooks and William J.

It enabled me to successfully apply to the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art, London, for a grant to help pay for a suitably illustrated exhibition catalogue (The collection was awarded &amp;pound;3,500). Its personnel arranged for the formal loan of works from the IWM, London (24 paintings and drawings by Carline and 50 photographs by Brooks and Brunell) and for their hanging in the designated exhibition spaces. The collection also organised public relations and advertising for the exhibition and a suitable on-line presence. Finally, it published a 100 page catalogue for the exhibition - fully illustrated with the majority of the plates in full colour.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I devised the content and scope of the exhibition and located works (76 paintings, drawings and photographs) within the collection of the Imperial War Museum, London to be borrowed for the exhibition. I undertook research at the IWM, London and at the Tate Gallery Archive, London into the three artists on whom the exhibition was to focus: painter Sydney Carline (1888-1929) and photographers Ernest Brooks (1878-1941) and William J. Brunell (1878-1960). I also researched the history of the British military involvement on the Italian Front in 1917-18 in depth. As a consequence of my research I wrote two essays for the exhibition catalogue (which I also edited), one of Sydney Carline and one on Brooks and Brunell. I also contributed a politico-military-cultural timeline of key events to the catalogue and provided the text for the main exhibition information panels. I helped design an exhibition leaflet and helped with the hanging of the works prior to the opening of the exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper for College Art Association annual Conference (New York): 'We Are Engaged In The Battle of Life: Social Darwinism and Imperialism in the First World War Memorial Sculpture of Eric Kennington and Charles Sargeant Jagger.'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA6DAF24-C3C1-4085-A7B6-1C42FFEE7162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave 20 minute paper at the annual CAA Conference, this year held in Manhattan, as part of session entitled: 'Conflict as Cultural Catalyst in Twentieth Century British Art.' Drawing upon my ongoing research into First World War memorial sculpture in London and the south-east of England by Kennington and Jagger, I argued that there imagery of the British soldier in action on the Western Front was as much informed by their pre-war reading of texts by Rudyard Kipling, Jack London and HG Wells as by their own experiences of coming under fire while in uniform and as official war artists. I also commented on their shared enthusiasm for and belief in the British Empire; both were convinced that the Empire, which post-1918 had been been larger, would demand further struggle and sacrifice from the British male to ensure its continued viability and existence. I finally explored how their later imagery of the British tommy, from the 1930's, can be related to contemporary debates as to whether the war had been nothing more than an exercise in futility as well as the extent to which artists such as Kennington and Jagger drew upon the examples of past Imperial sculpture, from Assyria, Egypt and Rome, in the British Museum and Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum for inspiration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adcd28056740.02308614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://conference.collegeart.org/programs/conflict-as-cultural-catalyst-in-britain</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interviewed as Expert on British Art and Public Sculpture for Television Documentary, 'War Art with Eddie Redmayne', Foxtrot Films</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>483D1614-51B9-402E-8699-182390736101</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviewed for approx. 1 hour by actor Eddie Redmayne for documentary 'War Art with Eddie Redmayne'; broadcast on ITV1 in May 2015.

I discussed about two dozen First World War memorials in London with fascinating stories that the general public may not be at all aware of - even though they may have walked, driven, cycled past the memorials many times. I described the memorials as 'hidden gems' that were 'strangely invisible.' After each talk I took questions from a BBC London Radio presenter and then from members of the audience - which included members of the general public, military veterans and students at secondary school and in higher education working on projects connected with the First World War. I was able to focus on Great War sculptors whose work in London ought to be much better known and appreciated such as: Charles Sargeant Jagger; Philip Lindsay Clark; Gilbert Ledward; Ferdinand Blundstone and Adrian Jones.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc689e81c7b2.71298851</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/ww1-woolwich</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk on Soldier-Sculptors and First World War Memorials in London, for the Twentieth Century Society, November 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC41005A-EFFB-494C-9718-0C29A3E4DCE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Drawing upon recent research for BBC Radio London and the AHRC 'World War One at Home' Project I gave a talk of one hour's duration in November 2014 for members of the Twentieth Century Society and of the general public on the First World War memorial sculpture in London by three 'soldier-sculptors' i.e. sculptors with combat experience: Eric Kennington (24th Infantry Division Memorial in Battersea Park, 1922-24), Philip Lindsay Clark (St. Saviours Anglican Church, Borough High Street, 1920-22) and Charles Sargeant Jagger (Royal Artillery Memorial, Hyde Park Corner, 1921-25).

Imagery by among others: John Millard, Charles Sargeant Jagger and William Goscombe John on the Wirral Peninsula, Macclesfield and Manchester were considered. I argued that while Millard presented a more conventional image of the Tommy as victim, John and Jagger powerfully presented the British soldier as a thoroughly modern warrior, completely at home with a total war deploying the latest mass produced weaponry. I further argued that John and Jagger's conception of the Tommy was in fact much more in line with the latest research within socio-military history regarding the strengths and failings of the British First World Soldier whereas Millard's more tragic presentation of the Tommy anticipated the so-called 'disillusioned' interpretation of Britain's place which became an unquestioned accepted wisdom in the UK in the 1930's.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ada11f4194e9.82084383</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://fwwnetwork.wordpress.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gave Talk, 30 minutes, to Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, Goethe Institute, London, March 2015 about First World War memorial sculpture by C.S.

My talk focussed on the experiences of C.S. Jagger as a soldier, 1915-18 and his war memorial sculpture produced thereafter c. 1919-33 in London and elsewhere in the world (in France, Belgium, Egypt and India). I prepared an information sheet exploring Jagger's war memorials, copies of which were available on the day at the Goethe Institute - the venue for the Study Day.

In 45 minutes I explored how imagery produced by Carline c. 1918-20 (and now in the collection of the Imperial War Museum, London) can be fruitfully related to the latest military history research about the vital contribution made in 1918 by the RAF to destroying organised Ottoman Turkish resistance in Palestine and Austro-Hungarian forces in north-eastern Italy (provinces of Veneto and Venezia-Friuli-Giulia). Indeed, I argued that Carline's imagery reinforce the contention that RAF tactics in those areas in 1918 anticipated by over twenty years the Luftwaffe's significant contribution to the success of the German Army's Blitzkrieg campaigns of 1939-41. Drawing upon my ongoing research into Carline's career, in the archives of the IWM, London and in Tate Britain, I also explored how Carline's imagery also shed a revealing light on the British in the Middle East as the area was in the process of entering the British Empire, following decisions taken at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 i.e. Carline toured Palestine and Mesopotamia/Iraq as they were designated British League of Nations Mandates.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adc83c5122a7.64084235</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://rafmuseum.org.uk/london/what's-going-on/events/havoc-from-the-heavens</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference Paper in Ottawa, Canada: 'On The Border Between Two Worlds: Identity and Memory in Eric Kennington's 'The Conquerors/The Victims' (1920).'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F8F1DCE-7B0E-44B2-8B90-16A19D8766F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a 20 minute paper as part of major three-day annual international conference of the North American Society of Military History with the theme 'Crossing Borders, Crossing Boundaries' held 14-17 April 2016 at the Canadian Museum of History and at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa in which I explored a large painting in oils Eric Kennington painted in 1920 for Lord Beaverbrook's Canadian War Memorials Scheme depicting a platoon of Canadian-Scottish Highlanders marching across a 1918 battlefield. From recent research into the work by London-born artist Kennington I was able to provide its owner the Canadian War Museum with new information as to when Kennington painted the work and why his presentation of the Canadian-Scots was so distinctive i.e. his platoon contained two men of evidently Black African origin plus a Native Canadian Inuit while several of the men possesses unnaturally pale facial complexions (this indicated that though they survived the last months of the war on the Western Front, they died from influenza that ravaged their rest camp in Belgium early in 1919). In addition, I was also able to shed new light on the reasons why when Kennington exhibited the work for the first time in the UK, in London in October 1920, he changed its title from the officially conferred 'The Conquerors' to the much less triumphalist 'The Victims' and how he defended this title change in several press interviews he gave at the time.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ada5fae94ff2.54889990</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.smh.hq.org/conf/pastmeetings.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk (45 minutes) at the Hepworth, Wakefield, March 2015 on First World War Memorial Sculpture of Charles Sargeant Jagger in London and in South Yorkshire</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6164033-A8FF-41F3-9E35-DF90D3B4CD06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited by Chief Curator of the Hepworth to give talk of approx. 45 minutes aimed at middlebrow general public (educated but non-specialist) on the topic of the Jagger war memorial bas-relief in the Gallery's collection in relation to other war memorials he produced in London, for locations in his native South Yorkshire and in the North-West of England (Wirral Peninsula and Manchester).
