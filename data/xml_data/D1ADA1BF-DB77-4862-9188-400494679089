Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0500331</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In order to survive human cells must continuously release and internalize both soluble and membrane bound factors. The most common method by which cells release factors such as serum proteins, peptide hormones and antibodies is called ?exocytosis?. In human cells exocytosis can happen in three ways. Every cell in our body is constantly producing small vesicles, which fuse to the plasma membrane. This is how we replenish the external membrane around our cells. In addition some specialized cells like neurons and secretory cells posses a population of specialized vesicles or granules, which only fuse with the plasma membrane when the cell is stimulated. It is very important that this form of exocytosis is tightly controlled as neurons must only transmit signals at the appropriate time, and the level of molecules like peptide hormones released into the circulation must be carefully controlled. Because exocytosis is an essential process, it is not surprising that defects in this process can result in different forms of human diseases including neuronal and immunological disorders, reproductive problems and diabetes. Although we now have a fairly good understanding of how exocytosis works in human cells there are still many things that we do not understand. To increase our understanding of this important process we plan to use a range of complementary technologies to build maps that show which proteins interact at different stages of exocytosis. We also intend to use new techniques to study these interactions in living cells. By building these ?living maps? we will have a much better understanding of how exocytosis is controlled in different human cells. This information could then help us to develop rational strategies for regulating the release of factors from specific cell in the body.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Exocytosis is an essential, conserved process that occurs in all eukaryotic cells. In general terms three forms of exocytosis occur in human cells: Constitutive exocytosis, which involves the movement of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. Regulated exocytosis, which involves the controlled release of preformed vesicles or secretory granules and a variation of regulated exocytosis, in which lysosome or endosome derived organelles fuse with the plasma membrane. Given the absolute requirement for exocytosis in human cells it is not surprising that defects in this process lead to a broad range of human diseases including: neuronal and immunological disorders, reproductive problems, albinism and diabetes. In recent years there has been a significant increase in our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of exocytosis in mammalian cells and the proteins that are required. However, there are still many unanswered questions. Although the core components of the exocytic machinery have been identified we still know very little about how the different steps of exocytosis are regulated, or the spatial, kinetic or conditional aspects of many protein-protein interactions. In this project we aim to address these important issues by using complementary bioinformatic and high throughput proteomic techniques to identify novel pathway components and define the full extent of pathway connectivity. In addition we propose to use live cell protein interaction assays to investigate the conditional spatial and temporal aspects of selected protein-protein interactions. To maximize the impact of our studies we have analyzed 90 human proteins, which are known to be involved in exocytosis. For each of these proteins we have identified all known interaction partners, the method used to define each interaction, and any known interaction partners for homologues of these proteins in other species (interlogs). By studying this data and analyzing how these interactions fit together within a graphical network we were able to identify proteins for which little interaction data is known, areas of the network which are fragmented or unconnected and many potential interlogs that have not yet been investigated in mammalian cells. By focusing our research on these candidate proteins we will be able to generate a far more comprehensive picture of exocytosis in human cells. This information will provide a novel insight into the mechanism of exocytosis in human cells and drive forward future functional studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206908</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Physical and bioinformatic analysis of protein interactions</gtr:description><gtr:id>CBAE0DF3-2EE3-4C45-BBFE-67DA1333E760</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MRC funded projects have facilitated the production of very high quality libraries and highthroughput screening technologies which have driven many active research projects.

Presentation at two out of the last three international human interactome meetings has resulted in the development of key strategic collaborations which are assisting our ongoing projects. In addition these collaborations will continue to underpin future applications for funding and provide access to important reagent sets. In particular we have established an ongoing active collaboration with two groups at the Dana-Faber Cancer institute in Harvard, which has provided access to the human orfeome clone set.
