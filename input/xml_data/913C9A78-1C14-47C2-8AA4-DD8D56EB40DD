By promoting these areas of research development and raising awareness of their beneficial potential for translation practice and policy making in Wales, this project aims to address the lack of correspondence between the expanding Welsh translation industry and the scarcity of research in this area, particularly on issues that go beyond language and cultural policy.

Whereas questions such as Bible translation and late twentieth-century translation and interpreting practices have received some attention, there is a shared critical perception that the main theoretical debates of the discipline of Translation Studies have not been brought to bear on the Welsh context, and similarly, that potential Welsh contributions have not made their mark in this discipline. The Network will address a series of interrelated research questions, aimed at bridging these interdisciplinary perspectives, which will fall broadly into the following two categories:

1. Historical perspectives:

a) How can we further understand the role and function of translation in Wales across history?
b) What would be the possible contents and contours of Welsh-language translation theory and how could we bring this body of writing to the attention of a wider audience through translation and critical discussion?
c) To what extent have translated texts been intrumental in the historical formation of Welsh culture as historically fluctuating between nationhood and mediation? 

2. Contemporary perspectives:

a) Can certain translation-related practices developing in contemporary Wales be understood as reactions to, and effects of, legislated bilingualism in the country?
b) Can certain emerging attitudes to translation in Wales be understood in the context of non-state cultural and political dynamics?
c) How can we assess the symbolic role of translation-related institutions and organisations in Wales and what definitions of translation have been promoted by them?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Network will be committed to public engagement and to communicating its activities and outcomes to both academic, non-specialist and practitioner audiences, within and beyond Wales. This is demonstrated in the Network's dissemination plan:

1) Academic audiences will be reached via three key outputs -to be disseminated in different disciplinary fields (translation studies and Welsh studies) and in two languages (English and Welsh). These will include: (a) A guest-edited Special Issue of the top-ranking journal 'Translation Studies' (Routledge), which will be the first English-language monographic study on translation in Wales; (b) One English-language article published in the leading journal in Translation Studies 'The Translator'; and (c) One Welsh-language article published in the Welsh-language peer reviewed journal 'Llen Cymru'. 

In the long term, the Network is also intended as a starting platform for a major research output by the PI's: a single-authored monograph entitled Translation in Non-State Nations, to be included in the series 'Translation Theories Explored' of the leading academic publisher in translation studies, St Jerome. This is a highly popular series with both researchers and students in Translation Studies. A volume on the theme of translation in non-state cultures would set the critical parameters for any future research in the field, at a time when unitary relations between state structures and language(s) are being more debated than ever. 

2) The network will seek actively to reach and incorporate non-academic audiences via the following activities: (a) active dialogue with media outlets in Wales and the UK, with which the PI, Co-Is and most network members have closely liaised through their own activities. This will include a co-authored feature article to be included in the magazine Planet: The Welsh Internationalist, a quarterly English-language cultural and political magazine which has often been attentive to questions of translation in Wales. Individual network members will contribute reviews about translation-related themes in the Welsh-language magazines Taliesin, Barn, and Tu Chwith; (b) the creation of the Network's dedicated website, which will include information on news, events and resources related to the network's theme, as well as all video material derived from the Network's events. Video recording, web broadcasting and 2.0 coverage of the Network's events will unlock the full value of its impact potential;
(c) the Network will be represented at one of the partner Universities' stands at the 2012 Eisteddfod (in the Vale of Glamorgan). The national Eistedfod festival attracts an average of 160,000 people annually and it will therefore provide an invaluable platform in which to host a thought-provoking a stimulating event related to the Network theme.

Close collaboration with the Network's non-academic partner (Cymdeithas Cyfieithwyr Cymru [The Association of Welsh Translators and Interpreters]) will mean that its events and outputs will be publicised widely among their membership (ca. 350 Wales-based translators and interpreters). Members will be particularly encouraged to attend both of the Network's public events (conference panel in July and two-day international conference in late August) as part of Cymdeithas' workshop series on professional development for Wales-based translators and interpreters. The Network's website will be hosted at Cymdeithas' server and will be maintained beyond the duration of the Award.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Shanghai Translation Publishing House</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration between Bangor University (School of Modern Languages) and Shanghai Translation Publishing House</gtr:description><gtr:id>C253BCD5-5201-47A9-8EA4-536C799C1021</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Special Issue on Welsh Literature of the journal 'Foreign Literature and Art', No 5 (2013).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542d6d86198d52.88532235-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>As a first output to this collaboration, a special issue of the journal Foreign Arts and Literature has been published, which features translations into Chinese of six contemporary Welsh authors.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This partnership will act as the framework for further collaboration between the School of Modern Languages (Bangor University) and Shanghai Translation Publishing House, particularly in terms of facilitating the translation into Chinese of Welsh literature.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference panel at 2012 International Conference of the North American Association for the Study of Welsh Culture and History</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F316851-D52B-49B4-85C8-BE60A28B0A36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This conference panel was part of the International Conference of the North American Association for the Study of Welsh Culture and History, held in Bangor in July 2012. It showcased papers by Project members Sian Beidas, Dr Rhiannon Marks and Adam Pearce, and was chaired by Dr Angharad Price. The panel cohered around cultural/theoretical aspects of translation history in Wales, as well as translation-related policy. A core aim of this panel was to demonstrate how better interdisciplinary dialogue between Translation Studies and Welsh History and Cultural Studies opens up new questions about nation building, intercultural communication and cultural activism in Wales.

The Symposium also marked the signing event of a colaboration partnership between Bangor University, the Wales Literature Exchange and Shanghai Translation Publishing House.

This symposium celebrated the initiation of a collaborative partnership agreement between Bangor University, the Wales Literature Exchange and the Chinese publishing house Shanghai Translation. This agreement will function as a framework in which to promote the cultural collaboration and literary translation between Welsh literature and China.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542d6a4e457516.98197294</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://waleslitexchange.org/en/news/view/symposium-reading-china-translating-wales</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>launch the Chinese translation of the novel The Rice Paper Diaries, at Shanghai International Book Fair and Literature Week</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B97B809-3D9F-46EC-A33E-7DFCC247C2CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Francesca Rhydderch, author of The Rice Paper Diaries, and Dr Yan Ying, the book's Chinese translator and project network participant in 2012 launched the novel at Shanghai International Book Fair and Literature Week.

All projected outcomes have been achieved, whilst we have seen also a range of unpredicted and welcome outputs being produced. Among these, I am particularly proud as PI to have seen a fruitful collaboration develop between one project participant, Dr Yan Ying, and the Wales Literature Exchange, an organisation for the promotion of Welsh literature abroad. This collaboration is already acting as a framework for the promotion of Welsh literature in China through translation. In terms of publications, the Project has produced a series of paradigm setting outputs (Baumgarten and Gruber 2014; Miguelez-Carballeira, Price and Kaufmann 2016), which have consolidated the so far almost non-existing dialogue between the discipline of Translation Studies and Wales.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Apart from the academic findings arising from the Project, other features demonstrate the relevance of the work of this research network for policy making in Wales. 
Project participant Prof Diarmait Mac-Giolla Chriost acted as expert witnesses and member of the Language, Policy and Planning Research Unit based at the School of Welsh in Cardiff University, to the Communities, Equality and Local Government Committee of the National Assembly for Wales on Thursday, 15 March 2012 on the matter of the National Assembly for Wales (Official Languages) Bill. This Bill pertains to the operation of the Assembly as a wholly bilingual legislature, including the production and publication of the official record of proceedings, known as 'y Cofnod,' in both Welsh and English. This oral evidence was preceded by a paper, submitted previously to the Committee. A record of this meeting is available on the link given below. At this meeting Prof Mac-Giolla Chriost was asked to provide further evidence to the Committee, as is noted in the minutes of the meeting. This Committee published its report in May 2012 and, as can be clearly seen in the body of the report, Prof Mac-Giolla Chriost's evidence was very influential (e.g. pp. 7-8, 20, 26-7, 31-3, 42-4, 52-3, 57, 60, 65, 67, 73) in shaping the final recommendations of the Committee. At the Full Meeting of the Assembly on 16 May 2012 a range of recommendations, including those directly informed by our evidence, were approved, resulting in significant changes to the Bill, including in particular the face of the Bill, and also the associated Official Languages Plan [Cynllun Ieithoedd Swyddogol]</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>13E067CB-D1F0-40D6-BC97-2816933E9640</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>542d75e2796728.51515542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://translationcymru.org/en-GB/Home</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61998C5C-DB5A-4678-B9FC-FB36DABC3689</gtr:id><gtr:title>English translations of Daniel Owen 1888-2010 : nation, canon and Welsh-English cultural relations</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/586f7d25d00b75abd417a8b3c4a1a656"><gtr:id>586f7d25d00b75abd417a8b3c4a1a656</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pearce Adam</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542d1ae48d3637.21936257</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B3BC967E-6874-4560-B579-7955175EAAD9</gtr:id><gtr:title>The darkened glass of bilingualism?
