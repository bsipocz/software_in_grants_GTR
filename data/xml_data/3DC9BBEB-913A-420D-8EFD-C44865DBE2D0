&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;This is a unique opportunity to gather empirical evidence of the experiences, issues and needs of residents living and moving through new urban environments.&amp;nbsp; Current research into the lives of families in large scale, inclusive, sustainable communities is lacking, particularly in the emerging market context.&amp;nbsp; The research is predominantly qualitative; however, an innovative mobile ?app? will be developed to explore family mobility. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;The project aims to:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;i) Investigate the everyday lives of families ? their interactions, issues and experiences (focusing on mobility and access to nature in the city) in a case study community;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>ii) Develop innovative tools for conducting community based research in rapidly-developing urban environments;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>iii) Develop academic and practitioner understanding of how principally western models of urban design are being transferred to other contexts and communities; with what successes and limitations can New Urbanism be internationalised? &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research objectives are not intended for single audiences; they are interrelated and will be of significant interest to a wide range of local and international stakeholders. In addition to the enhancement of academic knowledge, outlined elsewhere in the proposal, this research has relevance to a wider audience:

Practitioners and stakeholders: Planners; Urban Designers; Community workers; Play workers; Local Councillors; Private Sector Developers; Local Government; National Government. 

Engaging with practitioners: Working in partnership with urban practitioners is a central aim of this research project. Relations with urban designers, architects and planners in the UK context have already been forged through previous work on the New Urbanisms, New Citizens ESRC project, this work will extend this network and conversation to the Indian context. For high impact research, strong relationships with stakeholders working in the field are essential. There will be two workshop events, one based in India and the other in the UK, these will be networking events for practitioners based in the field of urban design, urban living and mobility. 

Benefit: The project has the support of Lavasa Corporation Limited (see attached letter), this relationship is vital for the dissemination of outputs and for meaningful impact (particularly given the plans to replicate Lavasa). This will be a significant pathway for ensuring the results of this project are taken into account for future large scale developments in both the India and potentially in the wider emerging market context (medium and long term impact). The project has the potential to increase the effectiveness of newly built communities, considering service provision, individual mobility, sustainable transport and access to nature and green space (for both future phases of the Lavasa development and other planned large scale communities). In terms of the UK context, where large scale new build developments are on the agenda, this research has the potential to inform and advise on examples of best practice from an international setting; consulting on local government development plans and informing those in policy settings for housing provision and the creation of liveable communities.

Local community: Participants of the research; children and young people; local residents; local businesses and services. 

Engaging with communities: Developing methodologies and engagement tools for working with communities, particularly children and young people, in the context of urban planning and design is an important element of the project. I have experience in running community based workshops with young people in the UK context and hope to transfer this knowledge and practice to the Indian context.

Benefit: Developing guidance for practitioners working in the field (in India), in terms of local consultation and particularly working with young people is important and this could have significant impact in terms of future engagement in the community. Engaging with residents in the form of participatory workshops can have significant self-and localised impact (providing a forum for individuals to have a stake, a say in their community). The project has the potential to stimulate change in terms of urban design and perceptions of local engagement, for both existing and future residents of large scale developments. In terms of a wider community impact, the research will be engaging with stakeholders who can make changes to policy, design and consultation; thus, the research has the potential to contribute to community well-being and quality of life, both in existing communities and those living in future areas of large scale development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242764</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hadfield-Hill, S. and Christensen, P.
