The project will seek to evolve DSA methods and techniques to generally improve this type of spectrum sharing service, and hence these improvements in the UK, will be fully shared and supported by our international ODA partners. The project will be led by the University of Strathclyde's Centre for White Space Communications (CWSC), working with international ODA university partners in Kenya, Zambia, Ghana &amp;amp; Malawi (further engaging with partners in their countries - both industry and regulators). There will also be support and input from a number of key industry partners including dynamic spectrum access database and cloud services partners: Nominet and Microsoft, production white space/DSP radio vendors, Adaptrum and 6Harmonics; UK SME internet service providers (ISPs) partners Cloudnet and Broadway Partners; and communication/ SDR software support from MathWorks, and FPGA hardware vendors Xilinx. All of the relationships and partners in this proposal are already pre-existing, trusted and in some cases very long term relationships, including previous and active Strathclyde links to partners in all four African countries. Figure 1 below illustrates the partners in this project.

CWSC and its collaborating partners have considerable expertise and experience in DSA management, and were instrumental in helping Ofcom as it progressed towards putting regulations in place for dynamic use of White Space spectrum in the TV band - regulations which went 'live' on 31st December 2015. The project will build upon previous work that has taken place in the four overseas countries, and will ultimately lead to benefits in the form of improved routes towards digital inclusion in those countries, and we anticipate followed later by 'ripple effect' to neighbouring or regional countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>(1) Who might benefit from this research?

The beneficiaries of this research will primarily be individuals, companies, and organisations in the African countries of Malawi, Kenya, Zambia, and Ghana. These countries currently have low levels of access to the internet (the lowest is Malawi which has around 6% penetration, according to published statistics for 2016). This project aims to enable low cost, widely available wireless internet access through research into Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Software Defined Radio (SDR), including trial deployments. 

Although the direct impact of the research will be in the named countries, the outcomes of the project could be exploited more widely via a roll-out to other African nations, and potentially also other developing nations further afield. Furthermore, secondary benefits can be enjoyed in the UK, by applying the lessons learned in DSA and SDR development in Africa, to networks for deployment in the UK. 

(2) How might they benefit from this research?

The primary beneficiaries of the research, in developing countries in Africa, would enjoy considerable benefits from gaining affordable access to the internet using DSA techniques. They would be able to access the many internet-based services and sources of information that the developed world takes for granted, including practical information and advice about agriculture and health, business communications like email and online banking, government services, access to educational materials and scholarship, and generally the opportunity to be better connected to the rest of the world. The specific benefit of DSA is that fallow spectrum can be exploited, which would keep access speeds high and prices low.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1176622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P029698/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
