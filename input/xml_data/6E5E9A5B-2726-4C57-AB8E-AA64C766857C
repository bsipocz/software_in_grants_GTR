These changes in museological discourse have resulted in new museums which aim to invite reflection on the representational and mediated quality of histories and geographies, and on memory as a complex aesthetic and rhetorical artifice. By granting a voice to what has been left out of the dominant discourses of history, diversified and sometimes even incompatible narratives have supposedly been granted a place in museums that seems no longer to aspire to any totalizing synthesis. \n\nThe new museums thus redefine their functions in and for communities not simply by changing their narratives but by renegotiating the processes of narration and the museal codes of communication with the public. They define themselves not just as institutional or disciplinary spaces of academic history or geography, but as places of memory, exemplifying the postmodern shift from authoritative master discourses to practice-related notions of memory, place, and community. New museums want to be seen as forums of the communicative memory of the victims and survivors by collecting and displaying donated memorabilia and oral testimonies of witnesses. In these museums individual life-stories are attributed significance beyond the purely private: autobiographical story-telling is part of the museum's newly perceived function of giving voice to the individual fate and transforming bystanders into 'secondary witnesses'. The key feature of these new museums is that they deploy strategies of applied theatrics to invite emotional responses from visitors: to make these empathise and identify with individual sufferers and victims, or with their living contemporaries inhabiting alternative modernities, as if 'reliving' their experience, in order to thus develop more personal and immediate forms of engagement. \n\nThe monograph will not concentrate on single case studies, it aims to provide an overview over the museums responses to major changes in our remembrance cultures, e.g. the prominent role of trauma and empathy in so-called memorial museums, but also on the changing perceptions and discussions concerning nostalgia and the notion of heritage. The monograph attempts to probe the political and aesthetic claims of the shifts in exhibiting practices associated with the transformation of traditional history museums into 'spaces of memory'. The emphasis here is on the role of different media and art forms in the transmission of memory and on questions of their gendering. The monograph will draw together issues which are very much at the forefront of scholarly discussions in Memory and Museum Studies and will benefit both research and teaching.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While working on this project I have organised and participated in research projects, workshops and conferences in which both museum theorists and practitioners came together to develop new impulses for curatorial and outreach practice. In my experience museum theory and curatorial practice are strongly connected - not least through the 'textualisation' of museums themselves. Museum theory and practice share the same desire for self-reflexivity which must be reconciled with traditional notions of the museum as a public educator and as a catalyst of social reform.\n \nMy stay as a Visiting Fellow at the Humanities Research Centre at ANU (Canberra, Australia) in 2005 provided me with unique opportunities to meet artists working on commemoration and re-enactment projects. Several of the HRC organised conferences in that year focused on these questions and they fostered my interest in the role of different media and art forms as technologies of memory. Even though it became clear that theorists and artists do not always see eye to eye on how difficult pasts should be commemorated, I think that my monograph will explore some common ground which will enable both sides to profit more from these encounters.\n\nThrough my postgraduate and PhD students, who work on related topics, I have established contacts with a range of museum practitioners based in London, but also in other UK and European cities. My aim is to use this monograph to create the foundation for future co-operations between our university based research culture and those museum practitioners.\n\nThe AHRC funded networking project 'After the Wall. Representing and Remembering the GDR', for which I was on the steering committee, held two workshops in which museum directors, curators and guides from museums such as the GDR Museum (Berlin), the Documentation Centre of Everyday Culture in the GDR (Eisenhuettenstadt), the Berlin Wall Memorial and Documentation Centre and the Berlin-Hohenschoenhausen Memorial took part. These participants wished to extend our exchanges beyond the limits of the project, and my repeat visits to those museums are an integral part of my workplan for my proposed project. Our discussions with Stefan Wolle, head of research at the GDR Museum, were conducted while the museum was in the process of major refurbishment. Since October 2010 they have not only doubled but also revised their exhibition, not least in response to the scholarly reception and impulses they received in the first few years of their existence. Axel Klausmeier, director of the Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial in Berlin, which is still in the process of a major redevelopment, has been keen to discuss the problems which arise when a memorial museum has to serve different memory communities.\n\nThe monograph will not only be a testimony to the productivity of these encounters, but will furthermore prove to be a valuable source for museum practitioners wishing to engage with questions of how new trends in remembrance culture are reflected in recent museological theories.\n\n \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59131</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Silence, Memory and Empathy</gtr:department><gtr:description>AHRC Research Network 'Silence, Memory and Empathy in Museums and at Historic Sites' (2012-2013)</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E0BB534-8492-4F7E-9D71-7351908D1719</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborative talk with Charlie Keitch (IWM, London): 'Interpreting the First World War Through Digital Media', International Conference 'Challenging Memories: Silence and Empathy in Heritage Interpretation', Buckfast Abbey (17-19 July 2013)

I engage critically with how collective memory reflects emotional and ideological investments in the past and investigate how museum practitioners have used different theories around memory, trauma and empathy within the museum context. 
My research examines how very different types of museums and heritage sites use the prism of memory to provide access to the past. I have pointed to problematic ethical implications of these practices which have to do with who is represented and how. I question if the mediation of traumatic memories necessarily foster empathy and/or an increasingly ethically responsible behaviour outside the museum environment. 
I was an active member of two AHRC funded networks, 'After the Wall: Representing and Remembering the GDR' (2009-10) and 'Silence, Memory and Empathy in Museums and at Historic Sites' (2012-2013), bringing together academics, museum directors, curators and guides from Germany and the UK. I convened the first workshop of the 'After the Wall' network to foster a comparative approach to theoretical paradigms of collective memory. My research is internationally recognised within the museums and heritage sectors in the UK, Europe and further afield (South-America, Australia). I have contributed to the development of new exhibitions in three German museums, the Imperial War Museum and elsewhere by providing advice on how to connect in nuanced ways with visitor responses to complex issues raised by exhibitions. 
For example, the head of research at the GDR Museum, Berlin, informally consulted me in March 2009 while the museum was in the process of major refurbishment and extension. Following my advice on the need to embed the exhibition's focus on everyday life in the context of political oppression in the GDR, he increased the amount of background information on the political structures and the economy of the GDR as well as the oppression by the state and opposition to it, doubling the size of the exhibition when it reopened in October 2010. 
The Dokumentationszentrum Alltagskultur der DDR, Eisenh&amp;uuml;ttenstadt, (Documentation Centre of Everyday Culture of the GDR) opened its new exhibition in March 2012 which reflected my suggestions to its director for addressing unresolved tensions in GDR remembrance culture by making communicative memory more accessible to younger audiences. The exhibition now includes recordings of eyewitness accounts and their object stories, personal stories representing different memory communities and portraying the different effects of historical forces on individuals.
The Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial in Berlin has to serve memory communities with different interests and investment in the past and combine different forms of remembrance. I analysed in great detail the problems which arise when a memorial museum has to serve memory communities with different interests and investment in the past and combine different forms of remembrance. I facilitated a discussion which allowed the memorial to both reflect its position in the field of commemorative landscapes as an historic and authentic &amp;quot;Berlin Wall-Site&amp;quot; and introduce a completely innovative language of design for commemorative cityscapes.
Within the UK, I have encouraged dialogue between museum practitioners, educators and academics in memory studies and museum studies and have advised several agencies on issues relating to memory and heritage. I co-organised the Empathy and Memory Studies Conference (Birkbeck, 23 June 2012) and subsequently worked with the Digital Learning Officer at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) who leads a project to develop online resources for schools linked to the Centenary of the First World War, which are available via the IWMs website. This involved exploring the impact of digital media on the presentation of sensitive material and their findings were presented at the conference 'Challenging Memories: Silence and Empathy in Heritage Interpretation' (July 2013).
I have also advised on an HLF funded project to turn the last remaining steam coaster SS Robin into a heritage site as part of the regeneration of the Royal Docks in East London. 
I was also a member of the International Partnership and Mobility (IPM) Scheme &amp;quot;Commemoration, New Audiences and Spaces of Memory in Latin America's Southern Cone: Trans-cultural Dialogues in the Wake of Loss&amp;quot; funded by the British Academy (2013/14) which aimed at a knowledge transfer between colleagues from South America and British scholars working on trauma sites. Two national Argentinian newspaper published articles about the conference and my keynote.
From 2013 to 2017 I have been UK Representative for the EU-financed research network COST Action IS1203 (European Cooperation in Science and Technology): In Search of Transcultural Memory in Europe (ISTME) which has allowed me to build new networks and collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9233C540-C3F6-4CE0-AD88-B8FDC7758746</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5419b933060862.73053209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research examines how very different types of museums and heritage sites use the prism of memory to encourage visitors to relate to the past. I have pointed to problematic ethical implications of these practices which have to do with who is represented and how. I question if the mediations of traumatic memories necessarily foster empathy and/or an increasingly ethically responsible behaviour outside the museum environment. 
I completed my monograph with the support of a grant under the AHRC Fellowship scheme: Mediating Memory in the Museum, published with Palgrave Macmillan in their prestigious Memory Studies Series in October 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My book publication has resulted in wide-ranging interest both from academia - I received invitations to give two keynotes (two Argentinian newspaper articles reported about this conference and my talk) and talks (at Universities in Cambridge, Warwick, Southampton, at the Jewish Museum Berlin/Germany) - but also from museum and heritage practitioners. I was consulted as advisor for the SS Robin heritage project at Royal Victoria Dock, London, worked with curators at various German museums and at the IWM in the context of their revamp for the centenary of the FWW and with the Holocaust Educational Trust. 
My book is 'Key Reading' on a range of modules, e.g. the Cultural Memory option at King's College, London.
The international significance of my research has been recognized by a number of invitations to participate in the steering committees of Research Centres (for example the Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory (CCM), London), to act as UK representative for the European funded COST ACTION, and to be a member in AHRC-funded Networking Projects (Silence, memory and empathy, 2012-13).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>624BE731-6692-42F8-BA47-DB6894F3ABEF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5419bad161ee31.24554426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>56F95B9E-143E-4EA4-B7FD-EB9C5645051E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mediating Memory in the Museum: Trauma, Empathy, Nostalgia</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/598a4297f44b847367e5a12d23c2609c"><gtr:id>598a4297f44b847367e5a12d23c2609c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arnold-de Simine Silke</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780230368866</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5419ab04345bd9.07274415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12E3F7B2-F4E8-4C4E-8775-C487B1468A8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Ruin as Memorial - The Memorial as Ruin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Performance Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea7de8bfb04bceb8203cb02d5f3e85d7"><gtr:id>ea7de8bfb04bceb8203cb02d5f3e85d7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arnold-de Simine S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>13528165</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58a2e914cff026.26803985</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>834FF1FE-E48A-4291-AD26-18708610855B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mediating Memory in the Museum.
