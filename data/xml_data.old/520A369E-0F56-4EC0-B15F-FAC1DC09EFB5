It consists not only of human participants but &amp;quot;Things&amp;quot; as well. The IoT has a great potential to provide novel services to humans in critical areas for society. This innovation however requires updating our understanding of the new risks associated with the new technology so that we can deploy it with confidence and society can trust it. 
Amongst the biggest threats to the trustworthiness of new technology are security issues and amongst the main triggers for security problems is human behaviour, either through genuine errors or though malicious intent. The core idea of SUCCESS is to upgrade methods and tools with a proven track record to provide a more holistic consideration of security in relation to human factors within IoT. 
Our core scientific innovation will consist on the extension of well-known industry-strength methods in our priority areas. Our technological innovation will provide adequate tools to address trustworthiness within IoT in healthcare environments.
Our project will validate the scientific and technological innovation through pilots, one of which will be in collaboration with a hospital and will allow all stakeholders (e.g. physicians, hospital technicians, patients and relatives) to enjoy a safer system capable to appropriately handle highly sensitive information on vulnerable people.
This innovation will be achieved by a multi-disciplinary team of recognized experts in their fields which has significant experience in knowledge transfer to and from society.
SUCCESS will have significant impact, strengthening the interdisciplinary approach to this important challenge at the crossroads between society and technology, creating new methods for increased security in healthcare, supporting the use of these robust methods by adequate open-source tools, and educating on the use of our products through real-life working prototypes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Scientifically, the project SUCCESS will produce: extensions to important existing mechanisms such as the BIP methodology to further improve certified code generation, secure integration of IoT infrastructure, supported with quantitative model checking and with attack trees for user-aware risk analysis and models of human behaviour for security analysis in Isabelle/HOL. The application of the extended methodology to the scenario of dementia patient monitoring provides a demanding and realistic validation of our contributions to support user-aware S&amp;amp;P, a reproducible scientific result in itself.
The impact of the scientific and technological objectives of SUCCESS is perfectly aligned with the expected impact of this call and addresses four out of 10 challenges: - Data visualisation for increasing user awareness of privacy issues - Empowering users with risk evaluation tool for their data and contacts.
- Assistive technology/techniques to encourage more secure behaviour and awareness of users - Dynamic security to allow systems to adapt to varying users.
CHIST-ERA impact: SUCCESS &amp;quot;cross[es] traditional boundaries between disciplines in order to strengthen the community involved in tackling these new challenges&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;range of disciplines&amp;quot; our team covers &amp;quot;include[s] expertise and skills in hardware and software, [...] cryptography, [...] data analysis, business models, user interfaces, user behaviour and human-computer interaction&amp;quot;.
SUCCESS will &amp;quot;[h]ave short-term impact on the development of designs, algorithms and prototypes&amp;quot; by extending formal modeling for human-centric IoT security, attack trees for IoT, quantitative model-checking, and certified code generation for BIP extended to IoT and validating these advances on our health care pilots.
These scientific and technological advances &amp;quot;will contribute to the longer term impact of a more user-centric and trustworthy IoT&amp;quot; because the focus of the scientific extensions of SUCCESS lies on user-aware S&amp;amp;P and human understandable risk assessment.
Scientific community impact: SUCCESS will push the importance of security and transparency of IoT higher in the agenda of research groups and companies. Our consortium wants to equip teams with a solution, an IoT security architecture which is reproducible for the community, and above this, to install in the community awareness the importance of developing IoT with user-aware security higher up in their agendas. We expect the technical advances will increase security of existing frameworks on 20% detection rate.
The economic and social impact of SUCCESS: a) Economic Impact: the overall cost for dementia care in Europe is an expected 600 billion Euro, b) Impact on Healthcare: at the present time, the expenditures on health care in the member countries of the European community account for an estimated 8.5% of the GDP and could rise up to 11.8% in 2030. SUCCESS will help this sector by facilitating the creation of automated monitoring of dementia patients, releasing time for nurses and doctors who can focus on more important tasks, c) Impact for Dementia patients: SUCCESS improves privacy for dementia patients from first diagnosis to care. It mitigates problems with insurance companies and employers of dementia patients. User-centred flexibility will be increased by 20% as judged by technical teams (in our case healthcare support). Compared to specialized installation with (specialized HW and SW) we will be able to offer same security at a reduced 20% cost.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199601</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7D0469C-B6CE-4D55-A8F1-AE5B6C6814A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Security and privacy requirements engineering for human centric IoT systems using eFRIEND and Isabelle</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff62f97c88a6123cefdf0c46f98480a8"><gtr:id>ff62f97c88a6123cefdf0c46f98480a8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kammuller F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a82ec2ec72bb3.73444522</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016456/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
