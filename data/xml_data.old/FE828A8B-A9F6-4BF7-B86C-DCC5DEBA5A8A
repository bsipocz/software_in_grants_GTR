In the typical population, the development of environmental learning begins with knowledge of landmarks (eg a park bench) along a route, followed by knowledge of the sequential order of the turns and landmarks along the route, and finally to an understanding of the spatial structure of an environment (a cognitive map).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) and Williams syndrome (WS) find it difficult to learn routes. This has consequences on their confidence, independence and quality of life. It is therefore important to identify the specific difficulties experienced, and find ways to overcome them. People with DS and WS (8- 25 years) and typically developing children (6-12 years) and adults will participate. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Studies will take place in virtual environments (virtual towns viewed on a computer screen). Studies 1-4 investigate developmental aspects of environmental learning:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>study 1: landmark use; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>study 2: knowledge of the sequential order of turns and landmarks; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>studies 3, 4: knowledge of the spatial relationship between two or more places in a learnt environment). &lt;/li>

Our findings have been published as parent-friendly reports in six issues of the Williams Syndrome Foundation (WSF) magazine (these are also made available on the PIs website: http://cogdevlab.weebly.com/research-reports-from-recent-and-current-projects.html). The WSF magazine (WSNews) is biannually distributed to over 1000 members of the WSF (note that this represents almost all individuals with WS in the UK) and to over 100 academics and clinicians in the UK who work with individuals with WS, as well as to overseas WS associations. 
Findings have been presented at one regional and one national WSF convention, with a further presentation at a national WSF convention scheduled in July 2016. Findings have been presented at three annual conferences of Down Syndrome Education International (DSEI). Both the WSF conventions and DSEI conferences reach families of individuals with WS or DS, clinicians, education practitioners and researchers. 
We have disseminated our findings through a publically available, dedicated website: www.elstrad.eu. This is suitable for all potential users and written in non-technical language (in English and French). The website includes guidelines to inform of the best ways to improve and facilitate environmental learning in individuals with learning difficulties, as well as demonstration virtual reality mazes for members of the public to practise their navigation skills. These methods of facilitating environmental learning have the potential to improve the independence and quality of life of the user (typically an individual with learning difficulties). This could also impact the family and the caregivers and peers in the individual's daily environment (e.g. school, college), as the individual will show less dependency on the support of their caregiver or colleagues in route-walking activities (for example, a school teacher may now feel that the individual can successfully run an errand within the safe environment of the school). Some downstream economic impact is also foreseen. For example, individuals who have relied on transport support services, may need these less as they become more confident to walk or to take public transport from A to B.
Professionals who work with neurodevelopmental disordered populations can gain access to our results through the above dissemination via WSF and DSEI and our website, as well as through papers in peer reviewed journals (N=7 to date) and at academic conferences (N= 14 to date). Our results and guidelines inform these professionals on the best ways to improve and facilitate environmental, such that they can enhance and support these skills in the individuals that they work alongside. For example, special needs teachers and coordinators will be able to use this information to improve the ability of these individuals to find their way around school, with knock on effects for route learning around their home and local environment. Paediatricians and psychiatrists working with children with WS and DS will be able to use our research findings to gain an in-depth view of the development of navigational abilities in individuals with WS and DS, and the impact that such abilities have on confidence and independence. 
A non-technical research report was published in 'International Innovation' magazine (http://www.internationalinnovation.com/enhancing-spatial-cognition/). International Innovation state that they &amp;quot;have a highly targeted and global contact database of more than 100,000 individuals across research, policy and industry. Our readers are senior stakeholders across a range of Public and Academic Sector Institutions - for example, major scientific and industry associations, research institutes, National Research Councils, University and academic agencies, European Parliament, NGOs and University libraries.&amp;quot;. The article currently has 108 downloads. 
A non-technical research briefing was also published on the UCL IOE website and featured in the 2014 UCL IOE annual research report.
Project ELSTRAD was showcased at the Science Museum, London, reaching national and international members of the public. This involved a team of up to 6 people who held residence at the Science Museum for two weeks full time. The team demonstrated mazes and discussed the research individually with about 1000 visitors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6D1632A0-4EFD-4B61-A518-7FD5CF1302EB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc2dcd856566.28128433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>According to Siegel and White (1975) the development of large-scale environmental learning begins with knowledge of landmarks along the route, followed by knowledge of the sequential order of turns and landmarks, and finally the development of a cognitive map (configural knowledge). Our data has generated new knowledge which does not support the notion that individuals gain knowledge of the sequence of turns when learning a new route. Instead, our data suggest that individuals use a recognition strategy at decision points to determine which way to go, evidenced by almost perfect performance in adults when asked to replicate long routes with 15 or more turns. 

We have generated new knowledge with reference to Down syndrome (DS) and Williams syndrome (WS). Their navigation difficulties relate to syndrome specific impairments, rather than an artefact of having learning difficulties. The DS group made significantly more errors in learning a six-turn route, and required more practise than the WS group. In typically developing individuals, the ability to learn a route was primarily driven by the capacity to shift attention from one location to another. In DS, the predominant driving mechanism was the ability to follow a set procedure (e.g. to associate landmark A and landmark B with correct and incorrect turns respectively), whereas in the WS group, non-verbal ability was more important. This suggests that different strategies are required for different groups. Furthermore, when finding the shortcut between two known places, the DS group, but not the WS group, often used an alternative strategy to get from A to B; rather than attempting to find the shortcut they summed together fixed routes learnt earlier in the study.

The studies in project ELSTRAD used virtual environments (VEs) which enabled well-controlled research methods. The studies employed larger sample sizes than previous studies (typically, N&amp;gt;150), which provided enough power for multiple regression analyses to determine the syndrome-specific mechanisms which drive different aspects of large-scale environmental learning. We also employed the developmental trajectory approach, which enabled us to determine qualitative difference in the development of environmental learning across our groups, typical development, WS and DS.
In addition to the studies proposed in our application, we identified a new research resource in 'travel training' providers. We gathered information regarding the content of the travel training scheme and the challenges to the learners. We also identified new research questions. First, the results of our initial study revealed an association between environmental learning and attention, which was further explored in subsequent studies. Second, anecdotal information from parents prompted us to create and distribute a questionnaire regarding the relationship between anxiety and navigation difficulties. Finally, because our data does not fit existing theories, this has opened up substantial research questions with regards to a new theory of large-scale environmental learning.
The use of VEs throughout project ELSTRAD have served as a proof of concept for a number of subsequent successful grants (Waterloo Foundation: &amp;pound;40,163; British Academy: &amp;pound;9, 960). We have also used our VEs with a large group (N=52) of people with physical disabilities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research and international collaboration strongly benefit the research domain; significantly, our findings will guide the formulation of new theory of environmental learning for both children and adults. Results have been presented at national and international conferences (e.g. Society for Research in Child Development), and published in international journals (Developmental Science, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology). To-date colleagues at Alabama University and Padova University have begun to pursue related research questions, whilst our special issue of Frontiers in Developmental Science (entitled: Spatial Navigation in Typical and Atypical Development) has further strengthened international dissemination and collaboration (EF is currently involved in a large EU bid which uses her expertise in navigation).
Findings have been disseminated via the Williams Syndrome Foundation (WSF) magazine and at conferences of the WSF and Down Syndrome Education International. These outputs reach families of individuals with WS or DS, clinicians and researchers.
