It focuses on theatrical representations of 'the poor', and extends beyond this to analyse how the poor have appeared across social welfare contexts historically, as well as how economically disenfranchised groups have drawn on theatre and performance to imagine and create modes of 'living beyond surviving'. As such, the research develops a contribution from theatre and performance studies to the understanding of social welfare and resource management systems in times of economic austerity and ecological uncertainty. 

Critical frameworks established during an initial phase of historical research will provide the foundation for collaborative research activity with contemporary theatre-makers and organisations in the second phase. The historical dimension focuses on two periods that revolutionised the economic performance of industrial societies and created new populations of the poor. A working hypothesis here is that these two moments are important for understanding the challenges and possibilities of cultural practice as a response to poverty in our contemporary moment. The initial focus is on a period in which the public turned from viewing poverty as natural and inevitable, to understanding the poor as an unwelcome and unnecessary effect of industrial society - a turn marked by the introduction of the New Poor Law of 1834. The New Poor Law institutionalised a conditional relationship between productive labour and survival in social welfare, and initiated the regulatory structures that later led to the Welfare State. Here, the focus is on theatre and performance in the 19th century workhouse. A range of performances inside workhouses are analysed, including: informal performances by inmates; performances by visiting musicians; performances related to work, education and military bands; performances regulating entry to and exit from the workhouse; practices of cleansing and branding; and performances of everyday life indicated by architectures of workhouses. After this, the research takes a historical leap to focus on theatrical representations of the 19th and 20th century poor on the London stage in the 1980s. This period, characterised by industrial and social unrest, and the economisation of the Welfare State, also witnessed the emergence of London as one of the most important and powerful financial centres globally. Here, the research focuses on the ways the theatrical economy of London exhibited the pressures and tensions of burgeoning economic neoliberalism. It includes an analysis of the (often) profitable theatrical representations of the poor in iconic plays and musicals of this time, as well as the impoverishment of theatrical labour supported by new economies of commercial exploitation. 

The second phase of the study draws on critical frameworks emerging from the historical lens of the first phase, to analyse theatre with, by and about poor communities in the contemporary era. It includes a commissioned piece of solo female performance inspired by historical sources relating to the poor female in the workhouse. It also involves a critical re-imagining of Engels' journey through sites of abject poverty in Manchester detailed in 'The Condition of the Working Class in England' (originally published in 1845). In collaboration with artists and participants, five theatre projects with economically deprived communities currently located inside the sites toured by Engels will be researched and documented. Finally, 15 theatre-makers working with economic justice agendas globally will be engaged in online reflective conversations about their work - with extracts from these conversations uploaded onto a website together with the documentation of local theatre projects. Outputs include public performances, a symposium, website, academic articles, conference papers and an edited book.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit the following users in the non-academic community: 1) theatre-makers and organisations; 2) social welfare professionals, policy-makers, and welfare rights groups; 3) teachers of theatre, history and social work; 4) amateur and local history networks. 

1) Five local and 15 international theatre-makers and organisations creating theatre with, by and about economically disenfranchised communities will be directly involved in the research, fostering a community of practice that does not exist to date. This group will exchange knowledge with the researchers and each other by engaging in reflective conversations and documentation of practice. Documentation of theatre projects will be made freely and indefinitely available via the research website. Local theatre-makers and organisations that will be invited to take part in the research include: M6 Theatre Company (Rochdale), Bolton Octagon, Bolton at Home Housing Percent for Art programme, Oldham Coliseum, the Royal Exchange Theatre/New Charter Housing collaboration (Ashton-under-Lyne), Men's Room (Manchester), Booth Street/Streetwise Opera collaboration (Manchester) and Lowry Theatre (Salford). I work closely with many of these organisations as part of existing teaching and knowledge exchange projects, and the proposed research will extend these collaborations. An international group of theatre-makers and organisations working on economic justice projects will be involved in reflective conversations about their work, also documented on the website. The following projects will be invited to participate: Active Theatre Movement (Sri Lanka), Albany Park Theatre Project (US), Al Rowwad Theatre and Cultural Training Centre (Palestinian Territories), Asmita Theatre (India), Bond Street Theatre (US), International Theatre of the Oppressed Organisation, Jagran Theatre (India), Los Angeles Poverty Department (US), Maisha Yangu (Kenya), Nos do Morro (Brazil), People's Palace Projects (UK and Brazil), Rooftop Theatre (Zimbabwe), Pandies Theatre (India), San Francisco Mime Troupe (US), Taller de Vida (Colombia), Theatre for Everybody (Gaza). The following UK organisations will also be invited to participate: Cardboard Citizens (UK), Collective Encounters (UK), Ice and Fire's London Poverty Project (UK). The commissioned performance will play to invited audiences of approximately 500 people across four performances, including representatives from organisations directly participating in the research. The research will support the artistic development of a performer with a strong track record of innovative devised performance and of working in educational contexts - with future students, therefore, being an additional, indirect beneficiary of the research. 

2) Many of the theatre projects documented will be collaborations with social welfare organisations, and representatives of these will benefit directly from the knowledge exchange opportunities offered by the research. The website and symposium will engage a variety of agencies interested in the cultural dimensions of poverty and cultural practice as a poverty intervention. A list of relevant third sector advocacy, activist, research and campaigning groups globally is being collated to support the research process and dissemination of outputs. Events and resources will be publicised across mailing lists of relevant research units at the University of Manchester, including the Brooks World Poverty Institute, cities@manchester, Humanitarian Conflict Institute and Institute for Cultural Practices. I have active links with each of these units. 

3) &amp;amp; 4) Teachers of theatre, history, social work and social policy in schools and colleges, as well as amateur historians and historical societies will be included on distribution lists. I have promised to share relevant materials with Peter Higginbotham, whose website offers a wealth of information about workhouses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170857</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'The House' is a solo performance - and is the outcome of the practice-based research process taking place as part of the Poor Theatres research.

From HowlRound, an organisation that works to share information about commons resources used by the alternative theatre sector in the US, to the Jagriti Theatre Collective in the Kathputli colony in New Dehli, which creates agitprop performances to counter the aggressive redevelopment a 'slum' area as well as support the self-development of young artists, theatre has been drawn on as a means to diversify the range of issues, people and concerns that are recognised as worthy of respectful and serious attention in the public sphere. The research draws attention to a neglected issue in theatre practice - theatre as an economic system of production and relation (often characterised by economic inequalities of some kind or another) - and debates the ways experiences of poverty have been engaged with and represented by theatre-makers. Creating this new field of research and practice - theatre, poverty and economic justice - helps to support and enrich ongoing cultural work in the areas of urban regeneration, community development and the creative economy. In terms of its methodology, the Poor Theatres research developed an engaged approach to researching contemporary theatre practices in impoverished sites. The research aimed to generate knowledge and understanding in partnership with artists and communities, and so the focus of research activity was on talking and listening, and generating audio-visual recordings of conversations where artists and community members participating in theatre projects reflected on their experiences and on the research questions from their own frame of reference. This has led to a unique set of materials that are now freely and publicly available via the research website and database, and that celebrate the way complex knowledge and understanding can be expressed in vernacular terms and collected via collaborative encounters, as well as disseminated via accessible formats. A blog, facebook page, You Tube platform and twitter handle have provided users with multiple 'ways in' to the material stored on the research website and database. Here, users can bypass academic publication routes to learning and engage directly with the insights of artists and community members engaged in projects, as well as use the website to make contact with each other independently of the research. The aim here was to provide a platform for discussing challenges and possibilities, sharing good practice, stimulating new approaches and engaging in fruitful exchanges. It is too soon to assess the extent to which the website and database is being used in the way envisaged, however, the research has generated interest nationally and internationally - it is hoped that the materials on the website and database will be drawn upon in the way described and that this model of engaged research be replicated elsewhere. The research has already attracted some international interest as a model for research and teaching. During the period of the research, for example, a Lecturer from Monash University in Australia used the database as a source in her teaching on theatre and social justice - and here, an 'alternative assessment' task was to complete an interview to be added to the Poor Theatres documentation (please find an example of this here - http://westernedge.org.au/archives/3357). At the time of writing, the PI is making use of the research materials on the database in her own teaching on social theatre and a devising module, and these materials will be drawn on in a new module on theatre and activism to be delivered for the first time next academic year. 

Locally, work with five theatre projects provided an opportunity to cement relationships and this led to professional placement opportunities for PhD and Masters researchers during the period of the research that are likely to be continued. The specific research activity was accompanied by evaluation and consultation activity for two partners (Royal Exchange Theatre and the Men's Room - see outcomes) and here, evaluation reports supported the ongoing efforts of organisations to sustain their social, educational and outreach programmes.

Finally, the performer, Carran Waterfield, is planning to fund-raise to rework The House (the performance outcome) for a tour to heritage and arts centres. This extension of the project may have a similar impact to that described above - for example, supporting heritage sites' attempts to address sensitive issues of social and economic exclusion that may be relevant to those sites.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>33F8C44B-B915-40A0-BDA3-949CBCA92B96</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544789dbb578f6.94958106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Poverty is a theme that opens up new perspectives on theatre in both contemporary and historical contexts - re-situating theatre as a social art form that has engaged with the everyday experiences of those adversely effected by structures of exploitation and inequity created by contemporary capitalism. Exploring theatre history via a critical lens of poverty and economic inequality allows for the inclusion in serious study of a broad range of forms and genres, contexts of performance and political interpretations of theatre and performance. Whilst the Poor Theatres research represents only the first step toward excavating some of these histories, it has shown the rich potential of this approach to understanding the politics and aesthetics of theatre as an art form across the historical contexts of capitalism, from industrial revolution to the contemporary neoliberal era.

In terms of research into theatre projects engaging with economic justice in the contemporary era, five broad and overlapping 'models' of theatre and economic justice initiatives were identified: activist projects; social care and welfare projects; urban and community development initiatives; projects focusing on social and/or political rights; and initiatives that seek to extend cultural access/the cultural commons.

A key finding of the research that had a contemporary focus related to the specific nature of the transaction established between a theatre agency and a target community. Theatre initiatives engaging with economically precarious communities in the contemporary era need to engage with 'vernacular' knowledges resident in places and in the social networks that exist in those sites/communities, in order to generate resonance and impact. Unfortunately - and especially in a UK context - short-term funding for projects means that the opportunity to develop intimate and responsive modes of engagement are limited. Exceptions include organisations and artists that make an explicit commitment to working over the long-term to build relationships with individuals and communities, and artists and organisations that find informal networks of resource - based on voluntarism, locating free space or establishing informal exchanges of resource - to sustain themselves to work responsively in those contexts. Over the course of the research period, the conceptual framework and practice of the 'commons' became increasingly foundational to understanding these more critical modes of working in contexts of austerity.

Contemporary social theatre projects work in partnership with the neoliberal economic agendas that define their contexts, sometimes in ways that critically reinvent those agendas, and sometimes in ways that affirm and reproduce those agendas in problematic ways. The Agency, for example, is a theatre-based initiative that draws on devised theatre methodologies to support young people to realise entrepreneurial projects in their localities - representing a creative inversion of neoliberal discourses and practices of entrepreneurship in a way that works to empower communities. However, theatre activities can also often help to maintain the 'appearance' of a successful regeneration, transformation of individuals and communities, and/or contribution to the 'creative economy', based on a more superficial engagement with sites and communities.

A missionary and 'self help' ethos is scripted into the discourses surrounding cultural interventions in impoverished communities and this carries both progressive and punitive associations. It is also an ethos that remains remarkably resilient over time and is present across the historical period researched - which spreads from theatrical entertainments in Victorian workhouses following the New Poor Law of 1834, to contemporary theatre and community initiatives on social housing estates. Boards of Guardians managing workhouses across the country in the nineteenth century regularly supported encounters between paupers and entertainers of all kinds, especially from the latter third of the century and in line with the 'missionary aestheticism' of various philanthropic and emancipatory movements. These entertainments were sponsored so as to communicate moral agendas, affirm social hierarchies, celebrate charity and intervene in negative cycles of behaviour amongst the 'idle and vicious poor'. Contemporary iterations of related imperatives include theatre projects with long-term unemployed people that try to encourage them to take responsibility for lifting themselves out of poverty.

As such, the research created a framework for exploring the nineteenth century theatre's engagements with the social domain from the New Poor Law of 1834, and this is the key area of research going forward. This historical trajectory places theatre's relationships with poverty at the heart of a re-visioning of social theatre history and reveals new perspectives on relationships with audiences, theatre as a social art form, and the politics and aesthetics of theatrical representation. In particular, the following areas have been identified as especially fruitful for on-going research: theatrical entertainments in Victorian workhouses (the research confirmed that there was a vast and diverse range of theatrical activity in workhouses); the representation of poverty in Victorian melodrama, including melodramas dramatizing examples of slum journalism; the national and colonial trajectories of temperance and missionary drama for poor children.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is hoped that bringing together a diverse array of theatre practices under the umbrella of economic justice and poverty will encourage artists, policy-makers, art educators, and agencies engaged in creative social work, to place a consideration of these issues at the heart of their practices. This might simply involve more extensive consideration of how everyday practices are effected by experiences of poverty, but it might also include the development of more informed and reflective guidelines for artists and educators working in relevant contexts. On the research website and database, users can encounter a range of practitioners reflecting on their own approaches, and these materials can be used to inform and inspire other practices.

For academic audiences, the research has opened up a new way of thinking about theatre history - through the lens of poverty and economic inequality - that may inspire researchers interested in a range of contemporary and historical theatre practices. The relevance of this focus (as is evident from the research publications generated to date) stretches from new materialist readings of theatre as a system of economic production, to re-visioning theatre as a complex and ambiguous representative schema for representing the poor. Arguably, this lens highlights the limitations of extant ways of exploring theatre's histories - a focus on poverty rather than class, for example, opens up a fascinating range of social theatre practices connected to missionary and temperance movements of the nineteenth century that have so far been neglected.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>014DAA15-5B2A-45E6-B0CC-75F5F569F3B8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54478e6950a770.15470696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.manchester.ac.uk/poortheatres</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An online interactive map and searchable database - a free online resource on theatre, poverty and economic justice initiatives - contains almost 250 documents connected to theatre initiatives locally, nationally and internationally. Items include audio-visual recordings, and textual and visual materials, from five theatre projects local to the site of the research - Manchester (UK) - and 16 recorded 'online conversations' with artists located nationally and internationally. The projects included represent a diverse and overlapping range of methodologies, approaches, histories and principles. They include large and high profile as well as small-scale initiatives, and extend from projects focusing on activism for economic justice, social care and welfare, community development, social and/or political rights, and extending cultural access/commons.
