His two most notorious sceptical results concern induction and causation. Induction involves drawing conclusions or predictions about matters of fact beyond what we perceive or remember. Suppose I see a white billiard ball moving towards a stationary red ball, and predict that the red ball will move as a result of the collision. Hume claims that all such inferences are based on a process of extrapolation from observed to unobserved. Thus having seen collisions of balls (and other objects) in the past, we naturally assume that this new collision will be similar, and that these balls will behave in the same way as those we've previously observed.\n\nBut why should we assume that the world is uniform, that unobserved objects and events will resemble those we have observed? Hume's most famous argument concludes that this Uniformity Principle is not in any way 'founded on reason', for it is not possible to give any solid basis for believing it. It cannot be established purely from the past observations themselves, nor is it self-evident or provable by logical inference. And to argue that the world has been uniform in the past, and must therefore continue to be uniform in the future, would be circular, for this is precisely the kind of reasoning from past to future which is here in question.\n\nIf our inferences about the unobserved are not 'founded on reason', then why do we make them? Hume's answer is that - at least in the most basic cases - we assume that things will continue to behave as they have in the past through brute instinct, just as a dog might expect its owner to take it for a walk when it sees her reach for the dog-lead. The dog expects the world to be uniform without drawing on any sophisticated reasoning, and so do we. But when we make these instinctive inferences, this also changes our view of the world. According to Hume, the very fact that we find ourselves inferring from the movement of the white ball to the movement of the red leads us to interpret the one thing as causing the other. We have no fundamental understanding of causation beyond this. So in essence, what we mean when we say that A causes B is just that As are always followed by Bs, and that we find ourselves inferring B from A accordingly.\n\nAll this sceptical argument is well known, and 'Humean scepticism' is standardly understood as implying that induction is irrational, while causes are merely subjective. But there is a major tension in Hume's thought, because he is also a keen advocate of 'moral science' and a critic of religion, and it is hard to see how a thoroughgoing sceptic could justify any such discrimination between 'rational' scientific and 'irrational' religious beliefs. Hence recent commentators have questioned whether Hume's arguments about induction and causation are really sceptical in intent, and have promoted a range of 'non-sceptical' or 'New Humean' interpretations.\n\nThe aim of this project is to vindicate a broadly traditional account of Hume's philosophy of induction and causation, while fully resolving the apparent tensions. Building on scholarly work built up over the last two decades, this account shows how Hume, while insisting that the Uniformity Principle is founded only on irresistible brute instinct, can nevertheless justify a preference for systematic scientific reasoning (which is maximally consistent with the principle) over superstitious reasoning (which violates it). Likewise, Hume's understanding of causation, though superficially sceptical, provides him with a basis for insisting that since the essence of causation is no more than uniformity and consequent inference, it can apply as much to the 'moral' and mental realm as to the physical. Hence so far from being inconsistent with his advocacy of inductive, causal science, Hume's arguments are designed precisely to foster it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>896357BC-E738-45C2-830C-018D3E564E78</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hume, Causal Realism, and Causal Science</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mind</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6afb736ab473b61ac2396d1b238be49f"><gtr:id>6afb736ab473b61ac2396d1b238be49f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Millican P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0470474ba8747</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F014252/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>963920AE-7577-4234-BB09-8B2D1C1FB695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
