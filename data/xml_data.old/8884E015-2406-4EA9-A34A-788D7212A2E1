It is particularly targeted at giving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) better exposure to large clients by reducing clients' reliance on extensive market histories or opaque online reviews that do not account for personalised needs. While large companies can rely on brand influence to bring clients to their services, it is difficult for SMEs to gain market access, especially newer businesses with little history for clients to draw on. This can mean that an SME is overlooked even when providing a service directly matching the client's needs. From the customer side, the project will allow more intelligent service procurement, based on rich reputation assessments reflecting the actual performance of providers, with less bias from branding and superficial reviews.

More generally, in any service-based system, an accurate assessment of reputation is essential for selecting between alternative providers. Existing methods typically assess reputation on a combination of direct experiences by the client being provided with a service and third party recommendations, with the reputation expressed as a numerical score or probability estimate. They do not allow the opportunity to interrogate an assessment to find out why a particular assessment is made, and so whether it is appropriate to a new service selection requirement, and they exclude from consideration a wealth of information about the context of providers' previous actions that could give useful information to a customer in selecting a service provider. For example, there may be mitigating circumstances for past failures, or a provider may have changed their organisational affiliation. These limitations are of particular significance in marketplaces involving both newer and more established service providers. New providers are often disadvantaged in a marketplace since a single negative review can disproportionately harm their reputation, and customers are unable to accurately assess the risk associated with new providers compared to those that are established. To make richer reputation assessments that take into account the context of past service provisions, this context must be modelled and recorded, and can be described as the provenance of the provision.

In the proposed project, we will use provenance records as a source of information on which a more nuanced reputation mechanism can be based. We will define the supporting algorithms and software infrastructure to allow this rich reputation information to be captured, analysed and presented to clients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>273973</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Catapult Centre workshop on Online Reputation (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6567DF04-4EF1-4D3C-9082-FB220A24D669</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We gave a talk at the workshop on the research ideas of JASPR, and our impact and engagement activities in this project.

Stereotypes, such as &amp;quot;colourful logo&amp;quot; can be used to improve the accuracy of trust assessments when relevant information is not available, but communicating stereotype observations to other members is problematic when members have different viewpoints or perspectives. Asking for a recommendation about a &amp;quot;colourful logo&amp;quot;, may be meaningless to someone who is colour-blind. We proposed a method for accommodating such misunderstandings by using a translation function, which we show to make stereotype recommendations useful even where agents have different viewpoints. 

Incentivisation Framework: We have developed an incentivisation framework, incorporating various incentives that will encourage service providers to release reports of the circumstances under which their interactions with clients took place. Knowledge of such circumstances gives individuals useful information to support their decision-making in selecting a future interaction partner. Provenance data provides a suitable solution for exposing information on various circumstances underlying a service provision. Providers are the obvious source of such provenance data, as it is a record of how they provided a service, but they may not be willing to release such records for several reasons. This may be due to the additional burden incurred on the provider side (the process of provenance recording and documentation could be tedious and expensive), or for competitive grounds (e.g. it may be against provider interests to release records showing that they performed poorly). Providing relevant incentives to providers is a promising way to encourage them to release provenance data. For example, in the context of service-oriented marketplaces, reputation is a particularly attractive (extrinsic) incentive for service providers, as reputation is commonly utilised by clients to assess the degree of risk associated with providers.

Delegation Hierarchy Interrogator: A provider accomplishing a complex task (composite service) may delegate sub-tasks to sub-providers, which in turn may sub-contract some sub-tasks to others, resulting in a multi-level delegation hierarchy. Assessing the reputation of the composite service provider without interrogating this delegation hierarchy might yield an inaccurate and an unfair assessment for the provider. For example, a low reputation of provider due to the past failures of its transportation sub-provider might give an unfair view if the sub-provider has been changed to avoid such failures re-occurring. We therefore developed a delegation hierarchy interrogator that accounts for the various levels of sub-provision, and for different types of dependency among sub-providers, in order to allow a more accurate and fair assessment of composite service providers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Both the Bootstrapping Mechanism and the Delegation Hierarchy Interrogator will advance the field of automated reputation assessments. The former will improve accuracy of assessments where limited direct experience with a provider is available. The latter provides more accurate and fair assessments of providers that utilise sub-delegation, allowing their success or failure to be assessed according to responsibility.

The Incentivisation Framework would contribute towards altering the behaviour of service providers with respect to provenance provision. This in turn would improve automated decision making, since the availability of provenance information would enable individuals to make more informed decisions (e.g. provider selection decisions).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE490082-D7C5-4566-8866-ECE437D3C0C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d4b73e893481.71821532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/jasprepsrc/publications</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Nathan Griffiths' membership of the Royal Society Machine Learning Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9143C3D9-1DEA-46C3-9FE2-C90702C27129</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b94cc82cb302.15505064</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/machine-learning/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Machine Learning Reputation Test Bed (MLRTB) has been developed as part of JASPR for research into trust and reputation in agent based systems. The aim of MLRTB is to enable development of reputation models driven by provenance records, generated by interactions and stored in a provenance store. Reputation assessment models process these records and produce reputation scores of agents in the simulation, which are then used to inform decisions about future interactions. Our goal is to use machine learning, provided by the WEKA and MEKA machine learning toolkits, in learning these provenance records and predicting future interaction outcomes.

Developing new reputation assessment models in MLRTB is straightforward, and implementations of several existing reputation assessment models are provided for comparison, including FIRE, BRS, TRAVOS, STAGE, BLADE, and HABIT. Written in Scala and Java, the MLRTB is extensible to new environments with different kinds of interaction and reputation assessments. There are currently three marketplace environments implemented that each focus on different aspects of reputation assessment. A logistics simulation is focussed on reputation of provider agents in compositions, a bootstrapping simulation introduces provider stereotypes, and a marketplace simulation builds on this by also modelling user and service contexts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0138DA82-2D7B-4461-AE6F-333FBA4957C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This software has enabled research into reputation context and stereotypes.
