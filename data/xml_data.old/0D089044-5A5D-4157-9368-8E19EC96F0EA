The country has one of the world's largest human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics and highest incidence rates of tuberculosis. South Africa also mirrors much of the developing world in facing a rapid growth in chronic, non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. The capacity to conduct relevant health research in Africa must be increased if these problems are to be addressed, and development and expansion of international collaborative networks are vital to achieving this.
This programme will strengthen and extend ongoing collaborations between the University of Oxford (UOXF) and the University of Cape Town (UCT) within the area of biomedical science. Thirteen research partnerships in health-related fields will be strategically united. The fields will include infectious diseases, vaccine development, primary care, child and adolescent health, mental health, neurosciences, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes and cancer. These focus areas include leading causes of global disease burden and disability. These partnership groups will exchange 10 PhD students from each of UOXF and UCT to the other institution for 3-6 months to learn new research techniques and strengthen the collaborative links between the research groups.
The programme will also bring all collaborating students and their supervisors together for a networking meeting to transfer knowledge and plan future collaborative activity to sustainably research critical aspects of the health of South African and global populations. It will also specifically engage with Historically Disadvantaged Institutions in South Africa with a view to developing capacity more widely within the country.
We anticipate that this programme will strengthen links between the UK and South Africa, foster a cadre of networked early-career scientists who embrace diversity and the challenge to improve the status quo, contribute to the imperative to transform South Africa's higher education sector, and deliver exceptional quality biomedical science outputs that will ultimately advance medical knowledge and improve the health and development capability of South Africa and the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For each of the fields of biomedical research covered in this application, the exchanges will facilitate the transfer and expansion of knowledge in that field. This will be of benefit to all academic and industrial researchers within the relevant fields and may ultimately contribute to the development of new interventions, therapies, vaccines, and treatments for many important causes of the combined global burden of disease. The advancement of medical therapies will improve health for everyone, particularly, given many of the conditions being studied by the co-applicant groups, those living in poverty. This collaboration is in a field of particular political, socioeconomic and ethical significance for South Africa - health. The disease burden in South Africa is massive, as highlighted by Mayosi &amp;amp; Benatar (NEJM 2014): &amp;quot;the health and well-being of most South Africans remain plagued by a relentless burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases, persisting social disparities, and inadequate human resources to provide care for a growing population&amp;quot;.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152443</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main focus of this programme is to broaden and deepen the research experience of PhD students from the University of Oxford and the University of Cape Town by allowing a funded exchange whereby they can experience research in a collaborating group in a very different research setting. 

4 students from the University of Cape Town have gone to the University of Oxford, working in the fields of Experimental Psychology, Cancer Research, Genetics and Genomics and Vaccinology. 2 students have gone from the University of Oxford to the University of Cape Town, working in the fields of Primary Care Health Sciences and Psychiatry.

The data obtained from these exchange studentships will be included in their PhD theses, for future publications and for subsequent funding applications. This will facilitate sustainable collaborations between the student and host group; and strengthen the existing collaborations between the home and host groups. 
Further exchanges are anticipated in the next period of the report, together with a partnering meeting planned for 2018.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data arising from the exchange studentships will be included in PhD theses, publications and conference presentations in due course.
