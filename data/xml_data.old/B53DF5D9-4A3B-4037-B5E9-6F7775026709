The first stage in the process involves the creation of 21 'Community Rehabilitation Companies' (from 1 June 2014) that will be owned by the Ministry of Justice for a period of several months, prior to being offered for sale to a variety of potential providers, including private sector companies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project examines this ?devolution? of the majority of probation services in one case study area.&amp;nbsp; It will look at the process and implications of moving the bulk of probation work (and staff) from the public Probation Service to a Community Rehabilitation Company with an uncertain future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will seek to understand this process from a variety of perspectives, including those of managers involved in running the Company and probation workers engaged in supervising offenders.

In so doing, the research will not only provide an in-depth, grounded analysis of the existing legislation, but also identify key areas for reform and improvement and as such we consider the following groups to be potential beneficiaries of the research:

- the host area Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) Management Group. By their own admission in their letter of support the CRC leadership state their desire 'to capture the learning that will come from the research to inform future organisational development initiatives'. Through the briefing reports we intend to provide at key strategic points of the project's development the research will look to provide real-time feedback and constructive policy/practice relevant commentary.

- the host area CRC staff group(s). We consider engaging with the research to be an empowering experience for the CRC staff not just in terms of the stimulation that derives from reflecting on processes and experiences of change, but importantly in being able to offer constructive commentary that can be fed back into the decision-making forums of the CRC through our briefing reports. This ensures the research retains the capacity to deliver real and manifest change in CRC policy and practice.

- CRCs Nationally. Whilst this research is a case study based in one CRC contract area staff perceptions of the transition process and experiences of the working cultures, practices and challenges/opportunities that emerge will resonate with CRCs nationwide. Through an end of project workshop with representatives from all the 21 CRCs invited to attend we will disseminate our findings and collectively engage in reflections on the extent to which staff feel participants within, and retain ownership of, processes of change.

- the Probation Institute. The newly formed Probation Institute is aiming to become a centre of excellence, setting new standards for the rehabilitation sector and providing an independent view of what constitutes good practice in working with offenders. We will engage with the Institute and contribute our research findings to their efforts to advance professional practice and promote organisation and skills excellence.

- Non-Governmental Organisations campaigning for penal reform. The research findings will provide evidence for organisations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform and the Prison Reform Trust in their efforts to debate and explore the impact and consequences of outsourcing and the boundaries of marketization within the criminal justice sector.

- International Probation Practice Audiences. We will disseminate the research findings through the Confederation of European Probation (CEP) which coordinates probation organisations across Europe, audiences watching the groundbreaking marketisation of probation services with a keen interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Merseyside Police Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative relationship with Merseyside Police developed through the joint HEFCE, College fo Policing and Home Office backed Police Knowledge Fund</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FB6FE2C-25AE-4FD1-A482-1D8B8BBED976</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Student Officers from the Police Knowledge Fund Project all produce individual pieces of practice relevant research as part of the completion of their bespoke postgraduate qualification.

On completion of the project other outputs will be listed here.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9298a3a1cb5.03959554-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Merseyside Police have played a role in the recruitment and appointment processes of the three seconded Advanced Practitioners who have worked at the University during the project's development. The organisation has helped efforts to recruit student officers and provide study time opportunities for them to engage with the course. Importantly though the organisation has been enthusiastic in supporting the development of mechanisms that have helped generate and then facilitate the operation of research projects. This has meant officers have felt supported in conducting research and that when their findings are disseminated there have been forums for those findings to be feed back into practice and decision-making processes.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Principal Investigator (Matthew Millings) moved from the 'Devolving Probation Services' ESRC project into a project management role for a Merseyside based Police Knowledge Fund Project (one of fifteen funded to run nationally). The joint collaboration between Liverpool John Moores University, Merseyside Police, and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Merseyside funded jointly by the College of Policing, HEFCE and Home Office ran from August 2015 to March 2017. Under the title 'Embedding Evidence Based Practice in Public Protection and Crime Prevention' the partnership (managed by Matthew Millings) was underpinned by three objectives; 1) to build capacity amongst police officers and staff to understand, critique, and use research; 2) to embed engagement with contemporary criminal justice and policing research in promoting evidence-based problem solving practice; and 3) to demonstrate innovation in developing evidence-base and in the dissemination and application of findings through knowledge exchange mechanisms across all levels of policing (publications, workshops and presentations).

The core activity of the bid has been the development and delivery of a credit-bearing programme of research training and supervision delivered by a mixed team of LJMU-based research fellows and Advanced Practitioners (officers seconded from Merseyside Police 3 days a week for the duration of the project) who have been managed by the PI. The programme that has been delivered to 72 officers across two sweeps of teaching - the Postgraduate Certificate in Advanced Policing Studies - culminates with student officers completing a piece of work-based research that is intended to positively influence policy and practice on Merseyside. In this way the programme seeks to develop the individual skills sets of the officers (through developing their confidence and ability to identify, engage with and utilise research evidence) and to make a contribution to the force's efforts to embed evidence-based thinking in organisational working culture of Merseyside Police. Beyond the administration and delivery of the programme the project has looked to develop knowledge exchange events to help identify and build new avenues for collaborative research activity.

The role of project manager and the direct oversight of the day-to-day operation of this project has supported efforts to establish and develop links to Merseyside Police to sustain and develop research activity within the organisation. The leadership experience of the ESRC project was seen as a determining factor in being moved to manage the Police Knowledge Fund project and the same skills on engaging with the practice community have been utilised on this project to help shape practice relevant research products. To ensure a project legacy and sustain the relationship the PI has helped shape a number of mechanisms within Merseyside Police to support research activity and to maintain a working relationship with Merseyside Police (an Evidence-Based Research Steering Group and being the catalyst for the development of Merseyside Police's Knowledge Hub). This co-production model of generating research activity and learning is now being proposed to develop new relationships with other criminal justice partners.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting of CREDOS (Collaboration of Researchers for the Effective Development of Offender Supervision), Porto, Portugal</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C2E072B-8438-4F5F-A118-3E44C4F2DB64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting of CREDOS (Collaboration of Researchers for the Effective Development of Offender Supervision) brought together academics and some practitioners to engage with research around contemporary challenges for probation services.

The event marked the end of a four year EU COST Action project (COST Action IS1106) titled 'Offender Supervision in Europe' (see http://www.offendersupervision.eu/). It was attended by over 120 delegates from 23 different countries and included representatives from the European Commission and the Directors of Probations Services in the Netherlands and Belgium. As a research team we were invited to give a presentation that reported on our 20-month ESRC funded project (ESRC Ref ES/M000028/1) entitled 'Devolving Probation Services: A study of the implementation of the transforming Rehabilitation Agenda' as our findings represent the most detailed assessment of staff experiences of the devolving of probation services and helps identify the challenges for probation services in moving into the private sector.

In September 2013 the Ministry of Justice published details of how its Transforming Rehabilitation agenda would restructure the delivery of offender management services in England and Wales. Within these reforms approximately 70% of the activities carried out by a public sector probation service were to be outsourced to the private sector through the establishment of 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs). Our research draws on 14-months of observation and interview-based research to capture, in one case study area, the experience of staff during this period of profound organisational change through the creation, early development, and sale of a CRC. The project involved the research team conducting a series of interviews with staff throughout the CRC, and extensive observational research of key decision and policy-making forums. Made possible through an on-going dialogue with the organisational management group the study benefited from unprecedented access to the CRC in terms of engaging staff and attending meetings to observe how the decisions of senior managers within the new company were being formulated, implemented, and, in time, received by staff. We have demonstrated that it is possible to conduct ethnographic research in the probation context, even in circumstances of extreme upheaval: something that has rarely been attempted. We have also demonstrated the importance of studying organisational change in 'real time', rather than retrospectively, when the impacts are perhaps less raw and are likely to have been subject to narrative restructuring. 

Our research has demonstrated that the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms have threatened the collective 'probation ethos' in a number of respects. Firstly, the notion of workers delivering a 'public service' is compromised by the introduction of a market-driven logic in probation work. Secondly, the restructuring of established working relationships, both within and external to the case study area, have renegotiated the distribution of status and power between the various stakeholders in offender management, particularly in respect of the relationship and interface between the National Probation Service and CRCs. Thirdly, the reconfiguration of probation service areas (and the probation staff groups working with them) has consequences for the endurance of locally formulated area based loyalties as powerful influences in how individuals and collectives operate. Fourthly, the reforms have resulted in a significant loss of 'human capital' in the probation sector as many experienced staff have decided to look for alternative employment.

More broadly, our research has been able to demonstrate that whilst there are some similarities between the experiences of workers subject to the involuntary transfer of their labour from public to private sector organisations within and between fields, there is also the potential for some important differences. In our study we have identified these as relating to the particular occupational cultures and loyalties involved; to the speed of processes of transition; the leadership approaches adopted to drive through change; and to the certainty of outcomes. How workers experience and manage such transitions, we contend, tells us much about the prospects for retaining (formerly) public sector staff within fields that are increasingly being subject to private sector influence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56f12905b47410.76422443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.offendersupervision.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/OSE-Brussels-Conference-Programme.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to European Society of Criminology Working Group on Community Sanctions and Measures (Sheffield, June 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F92BC3B-0273-4CBA-819C-B7E2FDF7258B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the research team presenting findings from our on-going examination of staff experiences of the implementation of the Transforming Rehabilitation Agenda in one case study area.

The research activity we have been able to report on helps capture the views of the probation staff most effected by the profound changes witnessed within the sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>581c5cd50e2467.53348418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project themed Panel Session at the American Soceity of Criminology Conference, New Orleans, November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A76AF97-32CF-4C81-9ACD-213213EB7006</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team each presented papers in a project themed panel session looking explicitly at the experience of implementing the Transforming Rehabilitation Reform agenda.

The event was developed around three themes with the research project being a prominent feature of the session concerned with 'Localism, Markets and Criminal Justice Policy'. Gwen Robinson (representing the project) was one of the session leads in her discussion of the project. The event raised the profile of the research further and the very recent experiences of practitioners we reported on provided a real stimulus and authenticity to debates around the increasing role of markets within criminal justice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>581332122151e9.36350026</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/396241/1/62297_PenalPolicyReport_WEB.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation of research findings, University of Leicester Criminal Justice and Privatisation Conference 17th September 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30E2786F-F06B-407D-AA3F-9C54594F43D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper based on the first phase of the research activity was presented under the title 'The Impact of Transforming Rehabilitation in one CRC area'.

The splitting of probation services from 35 Probation Trusts into seven regionally based public sector National Probation Service divisions and 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies formally took place on 1st June 2014, a little over a year after the devolution of probation service was first mooted in consultation leading to the Transforming Rehabilitation Agenda reform programme. In the run up to the splitting of services concerns were expressed about the speed and scope of the changes and there remained a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the processes and timelines. The ambition was that as the CRCs commenced operations in June 2014 so too would a bidding process begin to identify potential new owners, assess their suitability, formalise the outsourcing processes and have them in place to assume full ownership within the space of 12-months. 

The ability of our research to capture and report upon the staff experiences of implementing these changes has, and continues to, enable us to reach out and make rich contributions to debates in academia, practice, and beyond. The profound and dynamic nature of the changes has been a source of interest for policy commentators and interest groups within this field; the experience of probation is expected to be repeated in other criminal justice sectors. 

European practitioners and academics have sought to engage with our findings to see how the devolution of probation services in England and Wales proceeds as the probation models of practice delivered in the UK have been influential in shaping practice in a number of European jurisdictions. Evidence of this interest was the invited keynote address at the EU COST Action Offender Supervision in Europe (Brussels, March 2016) conference to an audience of approximately 150 academics, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers from across Europe. We have presented and are writing for the European-wide CREDOS (Collaboration of Researchers for the Effective Development of Offender Supervision) and delivered papers at the annual meetings of the European Society of Criminology Working Group on Community Sanctions and Measures (Sheffield, 2015) and the European Society of Criminology (Porto, 2016). In all these instances we have engaged with mixed academic and practitioner user groups and have been asked for further information about our findings. 

Our case study of the impact of policy on the transition of the organisational identities, occupational cultures, and practice values of probation practitioners has informed presentations at joint academic and practitioner-facing events at a local and national level. We have generated written outputs in leading academic journals and forthcoming titles. We have spoken at events concerned with the broader privatisation of the criminal justice sector (invited keynote address at the University of Leicester); we have presented to practitioner forums to promote thinking, professional reflection explore the representativeness of the findings (NAPO practitioner's forum Liverpool); and to seminars for policy-makers highlighting specific areas of change in probation practice emerging out of the Transforming Rehabilitation agenda (events at the British Academy and Institute of Government). We have produced briefing notes for non-governmental organisations like the Howard League for Penal Reform and the Prison Reform Trust who campaign and raise awareness around punishment and sentencing policies. The two articles we have published to date have both been subject to blog reviews and social media coverage/promotion on twitter by established commentator Russell Webster (see http://www.russellwebster.com/the-identity-of-new- probation/ and http://www.russellwebster.com/how-has-the-privatisation-of-probation-affected-staff/). They have also been featured in probation-orientated social media forms like the 'On Probation Blog' http://probationmatters.blogspot.co.uk that are read and extensively engaged with by practitioners in the field. 

The recent (23rd September 2016) publication of a report by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee into the performance and progress of the Transforming Rehabilitation Agenda has stimulated interest beyond those with a routine interest in the field. The report was critical of the level of progress being made to innovate and develop new working practices within the sector and expressed concerns that the 'rehabilitation revolution' sought by the Ministry of Justice was not being realised (see http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/ cmselect/cmpubacc/484/48405.htm#_idTextAnchor007). 
Project team member Lol Burke was invited (on Tuesday 1st November 2016) to provide evidence to the Justice Select Committee who are reviewing the Transforming Rehabilitation agenda. Members of the Select Committee have been supplied with copies of our research outputs and this will ensure the research is able to feed directly into a senior level of government and policy-making. 

There are three further, continuing impacts: 
Firstly, the team provided the host organisation with three substantive reports and accompanying presentations to provide real time commentary relevant to the delivery of offender supervision/rehabilitation services. Senior Managers and staff reported (and provided written evidence) that our engagement with the organisation and our reports provided a valuable stimulus for reflective learning in the development of the new organisation. The successful bidders for the contract area of our host organisation were happy for us to continue our fieldwork for the three months in which they assumed full ownership of the CRC. They were keen to engage with our research outputs to inform their understanding of the organisational and occupational culture of the CRC and attended presentations of our findings. Having seen the benefits of engaging in independently funded and rigorous action-research they are keen to consider facilitating a further sweep of research activity to capture the changing dynamics of the working cultures and identities. 

Secondly, the project design and ambitions has helped to develop further research activity. Burke and Millings have worked with LJMU colleagues to design a project that examines the experience of implementing the Transforming Rehabilitation Agenda within the prison setting, specifically the experience of developing Through The Gate service provision. The same research design has enabled activity to access, engage with, and track members of staff involved in implementing change. The experience and generated learning from this project has been crucial in securing a partner's investment in research process and in securing funding to allow the activity to take place. 

Thirdly, there continues to be an educational impact arising from the experience of conducting research within the practice setting. The research data has informed sessions delivered to undergraduate and postgraduate students across a range of courses in Criminal Justice, Criminology, Psychology, Law and Policing Studies. Beyond this, the relationship with the organisation who now own the host CRC has encouraged discussions around developing programmes of postgraduate level practitioner-focused research training and supervision.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8BD4FE07-6926-43F0-A69A-1F575A6A372E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b8be791e3856.23352283</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In September 2013 the Ministry of Justice published details of how its Transforming Rehabilitation agenda would restructure the delivery of offender management services in England and Wales. Within these reforms approximately 70% of the activities carried out by a public sector probation service were to be outsourced to the private sector through the establishment of 21 community rehabilitation companies (CRCs). This research draws on 14-months of observation and interview-based research to capture, in one case study area, the experience of staff during this period of profound organisational change through the creation, early development, and sale of a CRC. 

The project involved the research team conducting a series of interviews with staff throughout the CRC, and extensive observational research of key decision and policy-making forums. Made possible through an on-going dialogue with the organisational management group the study benefited from unprecedented access to the CRC in terms of engaging staff and attending meetings to observe how the decisions of senior managers within the new company were being formulated, implemented, and, in time, received by staff. We have demonstrated that it is possible to conduct ethnographic research in the probation context, even in circumstances of extreme upheaval: something that has rarely been attempted. We have also demonstrated the importance of studying organisational change in 'real time', rather than retrospectively, when the impacts are perhaps less raw and are likely to have been subject to narrative restructuring. 

Our research has demonstrated that the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms have threatened the collective 'probation ethos' in a number of respects. Firstly, the notion of workers delivering a 'public service' is compromised by the introduction of a market-driven logic in probation work. Secondly, the restructuring of established working relationships, both within and external to the case study area, have renegotiated the distribution of status and power between the various stakeholders in offender management, particularly in respect of the relationship and interface between the National Probation Service and CRCs. Thirdly, the reconfiguration of probation service areas (and the probation staff groups working with them) has consequences for the endurance of locally formulated area based loyalties as powerful influences in how individuals and collectives operate. Fourthly, the reforms have resulted in a significant loss of 'human capital' in the probation sector as many experienced staff have decided to look for alternative employment.

More broadly, our research has been able to demonstrate that whilst there are some similarities between the experiences of workers subject to the involuntary transfer of their labour from public to private sector organisations within and between fields, there is also the potential for some important differences. In our study we have identified these as relating to the particular occupational cultures and loyalties involved; to the speed of processes of transition; the leadership approaches adopted to drive through change; and to the certainty of outcomes. How workers experience and manage such transitions, we contend, tells us much about the prospects for retaining (formerly) public sector staff within fields that are increasingly being subject to private sector influence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research team provided the host organisation with three substantive reports and accompanying presentations to provide real time commentary relevant to the on-going delivery of offender supervision/rehabilitation services. This has been seen, by managers and staff alike, as providing a valuable stimulus for reflective learning in the development of the CRC. These findings underpinned a workshop attended by national CRC management leads, acting as prompts for sharing best practice. 

The study has contributed to the wider academic, political, and at times more public debates around the privatisation of probation services through being able to offer the unique perspective of those charged with implementing the changes currently sweeping through the sector. We have delivered a series of presentations to a variety of national and international level audiences that have routinely mixed academic and practitioners together. We have presented to and are writing for the European-wide CREDOS (Collaboration of Researchers for the Effective Development of Offender Supervision) and delivered papers at the annual meetings of the European Society of Criminology Working Group on Community Sanctions and Measures (Sheffield, 2015) and the European Society of Criminology (Porto, 2016). The team also delivered a keynote address at the EU COST Action Offender Supervision in Europe (Brussels, 2016) conference to an audience of approximately 150 delegates drawn from academics, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers from across Europe. In what is part of an on-going body of work engaging academic and practitioner audiences alike about understanding the opportunities and challenges within the devolving of probation services in England and Wales project team member Lol Burke has been asked to speak (in November 2016) to the House of Commons Justice Select Committee about the reforms in the probation sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7468EAC4-1C50-493B-A98E-7FA8ACC7FE62</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b8bae1488428.33631027</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The House of Commons Justice Select Committee hosted an informal seminar on probation and the Transforming Rehabilitation Agenda. 15 individuals ranging from representatives of the new providers of probation services, previous senior executives from the probation and prison service, and academics research active in the field were invited to make written submissions and attend the event held at the House of Commons.
