Many leading retailers are working hard to unify their in-store, on-line and mobile experiences. Proxama, a Norwich-based, global company, have been working hard for many years on mobile proximity technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth to seamlessly connect all parts of the physical world shopping experience for consumers. Proxama would like to use this grant to fund a project to validate a 'Connected Retail Service' for trial first in Norwich, working closely with Norwich Business Improvement District with the aim that it can be rolled out Nationality through also working closely with the Association of Town Center Managers. We believe this product will have a huge impact on drawing in and keeping consumers active in UK high streets.

The Norwich Connected High Street Service project will focus on validating and piloting new mobile services that will encourage and incentivise consumers to visit the high street. The project will bring together a variety of retailers and organisations that really need such innovative consumer services to ensure they can attract more consumers who will convert into loyal customers. Such services are only available to large retailers and brands who have invested heavily in their mobile strategy and can afford the capital investment, this project will open mobile services to smaller high street retailers such as cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, etc, as well as larger retailer chains.

The compelling set of services piloted in this project focus on the complete consumer journey from brand discovery, product/service information, purchase and loyalty. The primary focus of mCommerce today is online purchase of goods transitioning existing eCommerce transactions onto mobiles, however this project intends to develop new services that increase retail commerce through mobile. A key focus of this project is to validate services using mobile proximity technologies such as NFC and Bluetooth beacons to trigger contextually relevant messaging on their phone. Interactions with these 'Proximity Engagement Points' will allow high street retailers to provide compelling incentives such as redeemable coupons, offers, discounts, loyalty services, tickets, or event announcements. Offers and incentives may be redeemed by tapping similar engagement points at Point of Sale.

The project will focus on developing and validating a proposition of a mobile retail engagement platform to enable high street retailers to distribute contextually relevant offers and incentives through the use of standardised web tools and option of an aggregated wallet application or specific retailer application. Additionally the project will validate the market appetite for a white label aggregated wallet solution that could be rolled out across UK towns and cities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>997580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">972210</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
