AD is associated with the accumulation of two proteins, amyloid-beta and tau, and these have a toxic effect on brain cells. These proteins accumulate many years before symptom onset, and the associated brain damage is initially restricted to certain regions, known as the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampus (HC). As such, identifying changes in the function of brain cells within the EC and HC may help us detect the first evidence of impaired brain function in AD, which in turn will help us diagnose and treat AD before people develop dementia. To date, only one study (from the O'Keefe lab) has researched the effect of disease on the function of living brain cells. Given that brain cells underpin all aspects of brain function including memory, thinking and behaviour, this lack of understanding of how AD affects cell function represents a major knowledge gap, limiting early diagnosis and attempts to discover effective therapies.
 
My work aims to address this knowledge gap. Studies conducted by Professor O'Keefe (UCL) in freely moving rodents have shown that cell activity in the EC and HC is related to spatial function, and that this underpins the role of these brain regions in spatial navigation and memory. The human hippocampus is also involved in spatial memory and Dr Chan (Cambridge) has shown that spatial memory testing is more effective for diagnosing patients with early AD than traditional memory tests. Such work demonstrates how research in animal models of AD can benefit patients.

I will study transgenic mice, i.e. mice with a mutation causing AD. Electrodes implanted into the EC and HC will allow me to determine how disease affects the function of individual EC and HC cells as these mice move around a maze, and as these mice age I aim to see how single cell function alters with progression of disease. By recording cell activity as the mice explore and remember places within the maze I will determine how disease affects spatial behaviour. I will also assess how changes in brain function vary with the size and quantity of amyloid-beta proteins, measured from cerebrospinal fluid. A state of the art MRI scanner will allow measurement of the volumes of the cell fields in the EC and HC in order to establish whether the changes in function correlate with damage to these cell fields.
My study questions are:
1. What is the effect of AD pathology on EC and HC function, as determined by studies of single cell activity and spatial behaviour?
2. Do changes in EC and HC function correspond to changes in the structure of these brain regions?

Successful delivery of study objectives will have significant impact for basic science and clinical practice:
1. Demonstration that AD affects single cell function in living animals provides a platform for study of the mechanisms by which the disease affects the brain, in particular looking at the functional effect of molecules believed to contribute to the disease.
2. The EC and HC form a circuit with cells connected via synapses. There is now evidence that AD pathology spreads across synapses. Knowledge gained from this study about the EC-HC circuit would assist in further studies looking at the functional impact of such spread and would have considerable implications for understanding how AD affects the brain.

Furthermore, the results from my behavioural work can help in the design of an analogous spatial memory tests for use in patients which would have the potential to improve accuracy of diagnosis of pre-dementia AD. These analogous tests could be used to measure treatment effect across preclinical (animal-based) and clinical (patient-based) phases of future treatment trials; at present the inability to compare measurements across these different trial phases is a major factor contributing to the failure of trials of AD disease-modifying drugs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BACKGROUND. The entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HC) are the first cortical regions to be affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and this study will address one of the fundamental knowledge gaps in AD research by determining the effect of disease on the function of EC and HC neurons. The central hypothesis is that AD-related disruption of the EC-HC circuit results in disruption of spatially-related single cell activity and behaviour. Innovative methodologies will be used in transgenic AD mice to answer the following questions:
1. What is the effect of AD pathology on EC grid cell and HC place cell activity, and on the behavioural correlate of this activity? 
2. Do disease-related alterations in grid cell activity precede alterations in place cell activity?
3. Do changes in single cell activity and behaviour correlate with reductions in EC thickness and HC subfield volumes?
METHODS. Multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted into the EC and HC of TgCRND8 mice expressing a human APP mutation will be used to determine disease effect on grid cells and place cells. A novel parameterisable task will generate parametric behavioural reads to track disease progression and correlate with single cell data. Ultra high field MRI at 9.4T will yield structural correlates at subfield levels of resolution. Correlations with AD pathology will be established via quantification of amyloid-beta oligomers in CSF obtained by dialysis at the time of recording, and via immunohistochemical studies.
IMPACT. This work has major translational impact. The study of these neuronal populations provides an in vivo platform for evaluating the effect of trans-synaptic spread of disease. Outputs from the behavioural work will inform the design of analogous tasks for use in patients both as a diagnostic tool for pre-dementia AD and as outcome measures for use across preclinical and clinical phases of future treatment trials aimed at delaying or preventing progression to dementia.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Successful delivery of the study objectives will have a major translational impact with non-academic and academic beneficiaries. 

NON-ACADEMIC BENEFICARIES

The main non-academic beneficiaries of this research will be the patient-public population, specifically older adults with concerns about memory decline, their families and clinicians (primary and secondary care).

Patients, families and carers: An estimated 820,000 people in the UK have a diagnosis of dementia, of which the most common cause is Alzheimer's disease. The figures are inexact due to ascertainment difficulties, but it is estimated that three times as many people have mild cognitive impairment, which in turn may represent prodromal AD. The number of people with presymptomatic AD is entirely unknown.

Such figures illustrate the great importance of detecting AD in its earliest, pre-dementia, stages. Successful delivery of study objectives will lead to the development and application of diagnostic tests with high sensitivity and specificity for pre-dementia AD and as such will benefit both patient populations and the clinicians tasked with making the early diagnosis. This in turn will facilitate early treatment and other interventions designed to maintain quality of life and functional independence, including maintenance of employment. Finally, people in the earliest stages of disease are in theory more likely to benefit from new therapies with disease-modifying capabilities that aim to delay or prevent progression to dementia.

Agencies involvement in AD drug trials (Industry, Industry-Academic Partnerships): Two of the main reasons for the failure of all Phase III trials of disease-modifying drugs for AD are i) the choice of AD patients with dementia rather than pre-dementia ii) absence of outcome measures that are comparable across preclinical and clinical phases of treatment trials. The output of this work will address both issues. First, it will help in the identification of individuals in the earliest stages of disease - presymptomatic and prodromal - and this will aid recruitment of a target population for future trials. Second, a stated future aim arising from this study is the development of a behavioural task for use in humans that is analogous to that used in this study in animal models, specifically with a view to generating equivalent outcome measures usable across animal and patient-based phases of future trials aimed at pre-dementia AD.

ACADEMIC BENEFICARIES

Basic scientists: Historically, studies of disease mechanism have been conducted in vitro. By providing in vivo paradigms of single cell function this study will greatly benefit future mechanistic studies. The provision of experimental platforms for in vivo study of treatment effect on the function of vulnerable neurons, at single cell and population levels, greatly facilitates the preclinical evaluation of novel disease-modifying therapies. The focus on the entorhinal-hippocampal synaptic circuit has particular relevance for molecular biologists studying the trans-synaptic spread of tau. 

Clinical researchers: The current MRC-funded Deep and Frequent Phenotyping study aims to evaluate a range of disease metrics in patients with AD dementia. This study will be a precursor to future larger scale studies that will be aimed at patients in earlier stages of AD. The outputs from this study, specifically the results of behavioural testing, may therefore contribute to the protocols of future studies aimed at phenotyping pre-dementia AD. Early detection of AD also has significant impact for public health studies involving the longitudinal clinical, cognitive and imaging evaluation of the ageing population.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F44040A3-47CB-457E-869D-1812375DEC31</gtr:id><gtr:title>The honeycomb maze provides a novel test to study hippocampal-dependent spatial navigation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903"><gtr:id>2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood RA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a784cd566a230.66927419</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71F15034-FB42-4EEA-905A-79CEA83E144A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Allocentric Spatial Memory Testing Predicts Conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia: An Initial Proof-of-Concept Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903"><gtr:id>2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood RA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-2295</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ed82405635.41653780</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5CF4FD9A-6775-4D53-B2AF-A932D1AEBC59</gtr:id><gtr:title>The hippocampus, spatial memory and Alzheimer's disease</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Clinical Neuroscience and Rehabilitation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903"><gtr:id>2d9156ea48b093279da802bb33bb7903</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood RA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d97a39858775.75397303</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M018067/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
