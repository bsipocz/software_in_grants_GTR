Devolution in the UK, and the rapid expansion of the New Europe have led to a rise of importance of regional and national identities within the context of globalization of musical communities. What was once considered kitsch tartanry has been re-mythologized and now hybrid sounds from Scottish musicians portray a newer, emergent sense of national identity. Increasingly, musicians are performing deterritorialized and commodified music which is shifting attention away from musical provenance and authentic ideology towards more transient sonic identities and blurring established musical genres. These changes have powerfully altered Scottish music and identity and this research will investigate how Scottishness is performed in, and as, traditional music at this crucial moment in the public life of an increasingly (dis)United Kingdom. This project therefore aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the musical politics of identity, and to influence policy makers and key stake holders in challenging older mythologies and representing newly defined regions and minorities in the UK as a whole. This fellowship will result in a sole-authored book for publication and a resource-rich website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have benefits both within and without the academy. 

The fellowship will:

1) Benefit scholars in ethnomusicology and Scottish studies both through publication of the book and through conference presentations at the British Forum for Ethnomusicology and the International Association for the Study of Popular Music.
2) Benefit those scholars with interests in cultural constructions of identity and ethnicity within the United Kingdom. This will principally come from the analysis of Scottishness as constructed as musical discourse and discourse about music.
3) Help to redefine the analytical and methodological landscape for the study of Scottish music by demonstrating how critical discourse analysis, reception studies, ethnography and concepts from cultural studies and critical theory can be applied to traditional culture.
4) An important scholarly impact of this research will be to shape a more outward-looking perspective, recontextualizing Scottish music in a more meaningful and sophisticated scholarly and political space that recognises the complexity of people's political identities and everyday lives. 
5) I envisage that the fellowship will benefit musicians, promoters and policy-makers, particularly stakeholders with a national interest such as Creative Scotland, Visit Scotland, The Scottish Government Homecoming 2014 Team etc., who have an interest in promoting Scottish culture at home and abroad. This will principally be achieved by demonstrating the nuanced relationship between Scottish music, identity, ethnicity, nationalism and the media in the published book and through fieldwork dialogue with them, particularly at the symposium in month 6. The project website will also act as a means of publicising the findings to a large audience at home and abroad. In this way, the research will assist the UK in bringing in cultural tourists and the associated economic benefits associated with this expanding area of tourism.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69237</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online publication and dissemination of survey results for Understanding Scotland Musically</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59D87E8E-E719-4AAE-B425-436ECD0759B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I published detailed anonymised information on the results from my large survey of 275 respondents to my AHRC supported Early Career Fellowship research survey--Understanding Scotland Musically. These were made available online and simultaneously emailed to all eligible respondents to the survey in September 2014, at the project website: http://www.musicalmeaning.com/home/questionnaire-on-scottish-trad-music.

I have had a number of very positive responses to this open access publication of the anonymised results of the survey. One significant impact has been that several policy makers from Creative Scotland and Visit Scotland are now attending my conference in October 2014, which is also part of my AHRC fellowship. This has extended my network and made my research available to policy makers in the creative arts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542bf95e508f03.67456921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.musicalmeaning.com/home/questionnaire-on-scottish-trad-music</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding Scotland Musically International Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E410A40-1C3E-4D3F-B9F9-D6FAF59DB649</gtr:id><gtr:impact>62 scholars and policy makers attended a two-day international conference on Scottish traditional music at Newcastle University on the 20-21st October 2014.

? Authenticity in Scottish traditional music can be considered as a social discourse about negotiated belonging to 'Scotland' and 'Scottishness'
? That age, gender and literacy make no substantive difference to the community definitions of what 'Scottish traditional music' is, but that the key factors identified in defining this musical genre emerge in ranked order of importance, that Scottish traditional music should be: 1) 'orally/aurally transmitted', 2) 'composed in a traditional style' and 3) 'sound traditional to me personally'. 
? In many respects, the community of practice for this genre extends across territorial boundaries and nations. Musical deterritorialization is well established in Scottish traditional music.
? Actual musical performance is a very strong part of this musical genre with longevity of participation a key distinguishing factor amongst the community.
? The community of practice in STM is extremely well educated and demonstrates potentially very high rates of active participation when compared against the general population of Scotland.
? There is no statistically significant relationship between age and the degree to which respondents actively connect either in person, on social media or watch/listen to Scottish traditional music online.
? One of the key findings of this research is that the longer that someone performs STM, the more regularly they perform. 
? In general, it is remarkable how similar the entire cohort's views upon the definition and performance contexts are across gender, age, residency and educational qualifications are. This may suggest that participation in this musical genre itself constructs a strong and cohesive sense of belonging that is based in practice and aesthetics that can override other major social categories (needs testing further of course). Social cohesion for policy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key finding for me as a researcher from this project for future research focuses on the idea that we should be undertaking research into amateur and local community practice as a key site for musical genres, and we should be decentring professional practice in research narratives. In essence one of the key aspects of this research was that musical participation on a regular basis through time was the most important factor in developing a sense of belonging in this musical community (in contrast to older notions of authenticity and ethnicity or place of canonical repertoire).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F2A2053-09C1-4B10-A27D-090A8A447B94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e5a6cc32d07.94526148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.musicalmeaning.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on policy making at Creative Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>399447EA-28CE-4D46-8BB7-E467970436D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e58c8ce0b24.80540214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://creativescotland.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EBFFB4F9-18FD-4F79-AEF5-E8127E317FEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Focus: Scottish traditional music</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1522c7c85195e41c58fb1da9bce32e45"><gtr:id>1522c7c85195e41c58fb1da9bce32e45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKerrell, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978220224152274192227</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544e57053ebbc8.31379571</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A31589AD-B256-4320-BF02-EE2C2DDCB5C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Scotland: Music in History, Culture and Geography', The SAGE Encyclopaedia of Ethnomusicology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8"><gtr:id>5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKerrell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bee601dcdc53.09807132</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>18659ADE-B0D3-4D89-AB92-7B44D9C1BC54</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Scotland: Contemporary Performance Practice', The SAGE Encyclopaedia of Ethnomusicology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8"><gtr:id>5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKerrell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bee57b1407c2.90335007</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>99ED0902-79A5-4A92-83AD-169491469739</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding Scotland Musically: Folk, Tradition, Modernity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1522c7c85195e41c58fb1da9bce32e45"><gtr:id>1522c7c85195e41c58fb1da9bce32e45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKerrell, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d4310e85de26.41206214</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>105C68CE-FCB2-492D-B3B1-CC749D63732B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Traditional arts and the state: The Scottish case</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cultural Trends</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8"><gtr:id>5a23b6ceb2806985408ccba103bc97e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKerrell S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542bf7521870f0.58704352</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L006502/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>813866E9-8B0A-431C-A847-83DDED510CF0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rel, Material &amp; Cog Anthrop</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D417837F-1924-4F1E-875B-A160B88B4C98</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Traditional Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
