Metals catalyse the reactions of life and these demands are expected to grow.

Some of the earliest discoveries, uncovering metals as vital components of proteins and not mere contaminants, were made in the UK. Today we have world leaders uncovering how cells handle metals and the mechanisms of metal-dependent enzymes. Now is an opportune moment to exploit this knowledge to the benefit of industry and society. UK businesses which will innovate with this knowledge include established world leaders in their sectors and new entrants. 

Metallo-proteins contribute to bio-energy production, bioremediation, biomedicine, synthesis of high value industrial feed-stocks and more. The metal-handling systems of cells are vital to sustain adequate metal-protein speciation in vivo. As nearly a half of enzymes, perhaps one third of all gene products, are estimated to require metals, the impact of this network will be pervasive.

Metal-handling circuits can also be subverted to inhibit microbes. The exploitation of metals and metal-chelators as antimicrobials is a form of bio-mimicry since we are now starting to discover that immune systems manipulate metal-supply to inhibit microbial growth. Indeed, many common antibiotics tightly bind to metals and some antibiotics are closely related to iron-scavenging molecules (siderophores).

Metal-supply pathways can be engineered for the manufacture of supplements such as cobalt-requiring vitamin B12 and enzymes with metallo-prosthetic groups. Talented individuals are currently scattered in different UK research communities. The efforts of biologists, chemists, mathematicians, engineers and others will be drawn together by this network to allow effective knowledge and skills transfer with industry and with the relevant regulatory authorities.

The network will run for three years with structured workshops, a large community building meeting and additional ad hoc workshops throughout the tenure of the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The prevalence of metallo-enzymes means that success in synthetic biology may pivot upon an ability to engineer metal-supply inside microorganisms, plants and animal cells. For example, the sustainable manufacture of isobutanol has required the engineering of cellular iron-circuits: Aft1 and Aft2 levels were adjusted to activate genes for iron uptake to provide sufficient metal-cofactor for an introduced dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) enzyme.

The abundance of each metal is controlled inside cells by sensors (such as Aft1 and Aft2) that regulate metal import, metal export, metal trafficking and metal storage systems, they also switch metabolism to take advantage of more available metals and to minimise demand for those in deficiency. Metals which form tight complexes with proteins are held at low abundance while weaker binding metals are maintained at concentrations many millions of times higher. Under these controlled conditions the metallo-enzymes acquire the correct metals.

Network members will work with the bio-processing sector to optimise metal availability inside cells to give consistent biologic quality and yield. They will develop antimicrobial-chelants, ionophores and metal nano-particles that subvert the metal-handling systems of micro-organisms, they will explore the impact of microbes on the mobility of metal contaminants in the environment and engineer metal bio-accumulation and bio-detection. Members will collaborate with multiple companies to engineer synthetic metallo-enzymes and will optimise metal uptake and assimilation into biomolecules required for bio-energy production, bioremediation, biomedicine and synthesis of high value industrial feed-stocks. 

This network will consolidate the activities of communities working on Metals in Biology and speed the exploitation of those aspects of their research relevant to industrial biotechnology and bioenergy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network will have diverse impacts due to the pervasive nature of metals in biology (refer to case for support). Contributions to Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy can be categorised under the following headings:

Metals in bio-processing
Metal-related antimicrobials
Metal circuits for synthetic biology, bio-energy and industrial biotechnology
Metals in the environment
Metal-related nutrition and supplements
Metallo-enzyme engineering for bio-energy and industrial biotechnology
Tools and technologies for metals in biology

A purpose of this network is to promote interactions between the Metals in Biology research community and non-academic beneficiaries. 

We already have over 100 members and yet consider that a major role for the network will be to disseminate awareness of the significance of the sub-discipline and the opportunities that it presents, most especially outside the confines of academia. We intend to grow these numbers especially from industry. The names on the members' lists provide an early indication of some of the many beneficiaries, in academia and also within industry, regulatory and advisory bodies. Most of these individuals approached the network to request membership and all have been re-contacted in the closing week before submision of this proposal to ensure that they wish to be on these lists (this efficiency has avoided innumerable letters of support).

Throughout the term of the award, and in response to enquiries for expertise (from BBSRC, industry, government, outreach organisations and others) the network manager will liaise with the membership to source the best individuals to provide advice. The PI and CoI are actively involved in outreach activities including the generation of press releases, and the CoI has written popular science books and contributed to BBC TV series. Throughout the network such best practice will be disseminated within this community. 

The network manager and clerical assistant will deliver communications and promote the network, support members, maintain databases, gather information, assemble reports and brochures throughout the term of the award (see work-plan). The network manager is already part of a business engagement team so will bring contacts and sector knowledge into this role.

The research emanating from funded projects will be published in open access high impact journals and oral communications given at international conferences (after adequate protection of IP where needed). The track records of the PI, CoI and management team, attest to their commitment to such forms of impact activities.

Knowledge and skills acquired as a result of network activities (by PI's and also by RAs linked to funded projects) will be applicable to a broad swathe of academia and industry. 

Crucially, the intellectual property (IP) resulting from the projects associated with the network will be protected via company/institutional innovation and enterprise offices. The network will foster rapid routes to exploitation of such IP.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>325410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kirkstall Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Novel disposable cell culture systems for microbial growth in metal-regulated environments</gtr:description><gtr:id>5289A511-8B0B-4D94-8F1C-9D4DAD2CBFAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project aimed to test the suitability for microbial growth of miniaturised growth chambers (Quasi Vivo&amp;reg; by Kirkstall) that were developed for culturing mammalian cells.

This imposes a considerable metabolic load and stress upon the cell. The non-proteinogenic amino acids norleucine (Nle) and norvaline (Nva) are synthesized as a result of specific metal deficiencies (Ni, Mo) during fermentation. tRNA mischarging then leads to errors in protein synthesis (up to 25-50% substitution of Nle for Met), resulting in heterogeneity and effects on stability and activity. The potential impact of this upon the commercial yield with respect to specific activity could be important. This project will address the level of this issue in IB samples from Biocatalysts Ltd., thus providing insight into the potential commercial magnitude of this problem. The project will also test the effect of metal supplementation in different strain backgrounds used in IB to identify economical ways to prevent non-proteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Peter Chivers of Durham University (POCMIB027)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Procter &amp; Gamble</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chelation Therapy in the Washing Machine</gtr:description><gtr:id>59229B97-258A-43BF-A8D9-F39B6EEBD5CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac602f42ed46.65058824-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Biofilms are a major problem in all sorts of industrial settings, including bioprocessing facilities.

Using a CuSO4 solution, copper(II) was accumulated on these filters through filtration or stirred incubation. Both methods resulted in 1g of DRAM&amp;reg; capturing about 2.4 mg Cu(II). Approximately 20% of this bound Cu(II) can be desorbed into the surrounding medium and made available for biotransformation into copper(0) nanoparticles. These particles were visualised and positively identified by electron microscopy. Thus M.psychrotolerans can form nanoparticles from copper(II) accumulated on DRAM&amp;reg; filters. As DRAM is a biological material non-uniform in size its presence was a significant obstacle in the positive identification of metal nanoparticles. To facilitate electron microscopy visualisation of nanoparticles in this study DRAM&amp;reg; media was isolated from the culture medium containing M.psychrotolerans cells using a copper-permeable membrane. It can however be reasonably assumed that reduction of copper(II) can take place when bacterial cells are incubated together with DRAM&amp;reg; in the absence of a membrane. Moreover, a culture of M.psychrotolerans cells with a DRAM&amp;reg; media suspension might increase bioconversion through improved availability of copper(II). In this study, approximately 12% of Cu(II) ions are reduced by M.psychrotolerans to metallic Cu(0) nanoparticles after overnight incubation in LB medium containing 5 mM CuSO4. It is expected that the gradual release of copper from the DRAM&amp;reg; media may alleviate copper toxicity to live cells and thereby increase productivity. However, while the proof of principle study was successful with model solutions and controlled copper solutions, the industrially used DRAM&amp;reg; media with its unknown contaminants is currently beyond our methods of nanoparticle isolation and analysis, and therefore no nanoparticles could be identified from this source.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac2bb4905e62.89985726-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The environmental quality standard for copper in groundwater in the UK is set at 1 - 28 ?g/l, due to its toxic nature, but copper compounds are one of the few pesticides allowed for organic food production. They are also used to control fungal diseases in vineyards and coffee plantations; as molluscicides and insecticides; as a disinfectant in the farming and fishery industries and to prevent algal blooms. Whilst the spirits industry produce whisky, vodka and gin in a process which involves a universal step of distillation in copper pot stills, producing waste contaminated with solvated copper ions. Consequently this has led to increasing concern over environmental copper levels, their toxicity and the adverse effects on humans and wildlife. Epona Technologies Ltd has developed DRAM&amp;reg; filters, which are able to accumulate polluting copper ions from industry and agriculture but, without steps to allow its reuse, the problem is just being transferred elsewhere. With the finite supply of copper and its ever increasing cost, employing bacteria for the recycling of such contaminants to allow their reuse may provide a long-term sustainable solution. The Horsfall Lab is currently examining the process of copper nanoparticle production by bacteria. We have already determined that Morganella sp. can transform copper ions from whisky waste into nanoparticles of solid, zero-valent copper in addition to the reported biotransformation of model solutions and we would like to determine whether the copper ions accumulated by DRAM&amp;reg; filters could be transformed into copper nanoparticles too. This would be dependent upon the bioavailability of the copper ions accumulated and whether the conditions of bioavailability coincide with the conditions under which transformation occurs. It would also be of significant importance and impact if the nanoparticles were retained by the DRAM&amp;reg; filters, allowing for a separate elution step.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Louise Horsfall of University of Edinburgh (BIVMIB011)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Teegene Biotech Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bioaccumulation of platinum from waste</gtr:description><gtr:id>159CCB0F-428A-4EF2-B206-0957F0D9563B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad4a76196966.04027850-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Platinum is a scarce metal, being one of the least abundant elements in the earth's crust and as such has a high material value.

These key capabilities are difficult to achieve with conventional catalysts, making enzymes ideally suited to the industrial manufacture of foodstuffs, biofuels, pharmaceuticals and a range of other industrial biotechnology. The current challenge to the widening the use of enzymes is the expense of producing them. Large scale industrial purification of enzymes is often prohibitively costly due to the need for expensive, highly functionalised purification resins. This cost barrier limits the use of enzymes to industrial applications where unpurified, crude enzymes are suitable, or where the end product is sufficiently prized to enable the cost of purification to be recouped. 
We propose a revolutionary, cheap, universally applicable, enzyme purification method to widen the use of purified enzymes in industry. We will use protein fusion-tag technology to purify enzymes directly from crude preparations using cheap, unfunctionalised magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles, which can then be bulk purified through magnetic separation. By substantially reducing the costs of purification we seek to make enzymes an affordable, green and sustainable method of producing a wide range of products.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Sarah Staniland of University of Sheffield (POCMIB011)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Yorwaste Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Investigating platinum group metals in wastes from roadside verges</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDDC1466-FACB-4FDC-A465-93AB7163EAF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have achieved our objectives to investigate NP formation using synthetic peptides and analyse catalytic activity in the subsequently pyrolysed NP-containing plant biomass.

In microorganisms they make an enormous range of natural products, some of which are incredibly useful medicines, e.g. the penicillins. One of the strategies nature uses in the biosynthesis of many natural products is to modify a common intermediate to give multiple other products, which may have very different biological functions. Harnessing the power of such late stage modification has potential to generate many molecules from a single drug candidate. Such a process could expedite drug discovery by enabling the efficient discovery of optimised molecules. However, the natural enzymes are often not suitable for such use, because they have evolved to catalyse the production of specific products. What is needed are less selective enzymes, that can be subsequently optimised to be made selective if need be.
Our BBSRC NIBB work concerned studies on a family of metal dependent enzymes that add oxygen, or sometimes chlorine or bromine, atoms to drug-like small-molecules and proteins. To accomplish these reactions the oxygenases employ oxygen from the atmosphere and iron in its ferrous form, as well as a common small-molecule metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). Our BBSRC NIBB project principally focused on a specific subfamily of these enzymes that catalyse the addition of oxygen, or hydroxylation, to proline, an amino acid with a 5-membered ring. In one line of investigation we explored the proline hydroxylases for its selectivity towards different ring sizes and substitutions. We found that they can catalyses the hydroxylation of an unexpectedly wide range of rings, including tricyclic ring structures; some of these products are precursors for conversion into potential antibiotics. We also explored how these hydroxylases bind iron, using both assays for product formation and by X-ray crystallographic analyses of 'mutant' enzyme structures. Interestingly, we found that the proline hydroxylases can work with only two, rather than the normal three, points of attachment (ligand) of iron to the protein. These results inspired us to study metal binding by enzymes in cells (employing mass spectrometry) and to study variations on iron binding by other types of hydroxylases. In one case we found the hydroxylase can work with only one protein ligand.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad51a44860d9.75877934-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Biocatalysis is a successful method for the industrial production of small- or macro-molecules and can enable production of molecules that are difficult, expensive or often impossible to synthesise.

The long term objective of this project is to develop and provide access to metallo-enzymes useful for biocatalysis in cells on an industrial scale. In collaboration with UCB Celltech we will focus on enabling discoveries that will support useful bio- catalysis and bio-transformations for the generation of end products or intermediates involved in the manufacture of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, or flavours and also for the late stage diversification of tools for drug discovery (i.e. compound libraries) in a sustainable manner (i.e. Green Chemistry).

Exposure of skin cells to UVA, the oxidizing component of sunlight promotes the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species and leads to an immediate release of labile iron and susceptibility to both oxidative membrane damage and necrotic cell death. Research at Bath since 2006 has resulted in the synthesis and biological validation of light-activated protective compounds (i.e. light-activated caged-iron chelators, CICs) that respond to the UVA-component of sunlight. Upon activation by sunlight these 'intelligent' compounds release an active iron trapping agent (iron chelator) to remove the potentially harmful free labile iron released in skin cell and thereby to protect against iron-catalysed oxidative damage and cell death. A critical requirement for CIC technology is readily available, chemically tractable iron chelators, in which the iron-binding motif can be reversibly modified (caged). In this context, we plan to isolate and modify (cage) the pulcherrimic acid, a natural product from the yeast M. pulcherrima with iron chelating activity and subsequently evaluate its photoprotective activity against UVA-induced iron damage in cultured skin cells.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Charareh Pourzand of University of Bath (POCMIB019)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biocatalysts Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Optimising metal acquisition by commercial metalloenzymes</gtr:description><gtr:id>69DA61B7-2344-41AC-9979-A771956FA8F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the project was to perform analyses of the elemental composition of the enzyme products that are produced by Biocatalysts Ltd. for the commercial market to determine whether the metal occupancy of these enzymes was sub-optimal. If so, the expression conditions could be adjusted in an effort to improve the metal supply to the enzymes.

A single class of enzyme was selected for analysis, a set of three variants of magnesium-dependent galactosidase. We hypothesised that magnesium's position at the bottom of the Irving-Williams series would make it likely that these enzymes could wrongly acquire a non-native metal ion from further up the Irving- Williams series, either during heterologous expression or during sample preparation. Such association with the non-native metal cofactor is likely to lead to inhibition of the enzyme activity. The project partner, Biocatalysts Ltd. supplied the PI (Newcastle University) with a set of samples of these three enzymes, manufactured over an ~18 month period, to enable a longitudinal comparison of the metal content of these preparations. Each sample was solubilised and then analysed for total metal content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As a positive control, this confirmed the presence of abundant magnesium in each of the preparations (the product is exchanged into a buffer containing elevated magnesium concentration prior to drying). Importantly, in addition all preparations were found to contain significant trace quantities of (in order of amount detected) iron, zinc, copper and nickel. As the target enzymes in these samples are not homogenous however, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, further analysis was required in order to determine the amount of this trace metal detected in the preparations that was associated with the enzyme. Each sample was resolved by liquid chromatography, and the resulting fractions were again analysed for elemental composition by ICP-MS and for protein by SDS-PAGE. This method allowed accurate quantitation of the enzyme-associated metal, by separating it from unbound metal ions and from metals bound to contaminating proteins. The results of these analyses were that small amounts of copper, zinc and nickel (though not iron) were found to be present on the target enzyme in the preparations. The quantity of contaminating metals varied slightly between the longitudinal samples, and interestingly also varied between the three enzyme variants suggesting possible differences in their metal-binding properties. Importantly, though, the absolute quantity of these contaminating metals was low as a percentage of the total enzyme present (ranging from 3.8 - 12.8% occupancy), suggesting that they would make only a minor diminution of the total enzyme activity of the enzyme preparations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac1f49746281.75569380-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Biocatalysts Ltd produce a number of metalloenzymes of commercial value through expression in bacteria and fungi. However, metal supply to these 'foreign' enzymes may not be optimal in these protein production hosts, so that a proportion of the commercial product is either bound to the 'wrong' metal, or lacks a bound metal ion altogether. Increasing the proportion of the enzyme that is correctly metal-loaded can directly increase profitability of metalloenzyme products.
We will analyse the metal content of samples of the metalloenzymes produced by Biocatalysts. Where metal occupancy is found to be sub-optimal, we will work with the Biocatalysts technical team to test the effect of altering the bacterial/fungal growth conditions during enzyme production in order to increase the proportion of the target protein bound to the 'correct' metal ion.

Biocatalysis is gaining increasing importance in synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other speciality chemicals, yet barriers remain - in particular the dependence of many redox enzymes on the expensive nicotinamide cofactor, NADH, and more costly NADPH. We have previously demonstrated a novel H2-driven NADH recycling system, and in this Business Interaction Voucher project we have extended this system to recycle NADPH. The project exploits genetic variants of an NAD+ reductase generated in the lab of Dr Oliver Lenz, Technical University of Berlin, which are designed to have higher affinity for the related cofactor NADP+. We have identified a suitable NADP+ reducing variant, and we have demonstrated NADPH recycling by coupling the cofactor recycling beads with a C=C bond reductase, PETNR, supplied by industrial collaborator GSK.
Project outcomes: During the project we have recorded KM values for the most promising NAD+ reductase variants and identified one which functions as an NADP+ reductase with a KM of 1 mM NADP+, compared with &amp;gt;8 mM for the wild type. Data on the affinity constants for a series of variants will form the basis for the publication to be submitted in the coming months. The selected NADP+ reductase was then incorporated into cofactor recycling beads. A nickel-iron hydrogenase oxidises H2 and transfers electrons, via its internal relay chain of iron-sulphur clusters, to the electrically-conductive carbon bead. Electrons are then transferred through the bead to the co- immobilised NADP+-reductase which also possesses a relay chain of iron-sulphur clusters for fast electron transfer to its flavin active site. Thus H2 oxidation is coupled efficiently to NADP+ reduction. The imine reductase and ene reductase enzymes supplied by GSK were examined in biochemical assays with product detection by HPLC or GC. The C=C bond reductase PETNR was selected as the best enzyme for a first demonstration of NADPH recycling. In the presence of H2, NADPH was supplied to PETNR which was co-immobilised on the beads or handled in solution, for the reduction of cyclohexenone to cyclohexanone. Near-complete conversion (&amp;gt;99%) of the alkene to the alkane was observed by GC. Thus we have generated promising results on the feasibility of coupling H2-driven NADPH recycling to a NADPH-dependent hydrogenation. These results will be prepared for publication later this year as part of the demonstration of the modularity of the H2- driven cofactor recycling system which can be adapted for operation under different conditions by varying the hydrogenase or the NAD(P)+ reductase.

Pharmaceutical companies have recognised the benefits of using enzymes instead of traditional chemical routes to make drug molecules. Enzymes generate less waste, make purer chemical products, and allow chemistry to be carried out in water rather than in toxic, polluting solvents. However, there are challenges to overcome before enzyme approaches can be widely adopted. Many enzymes only work in the presence of special helpermolecules called cofactors, which are used up during the production of chemicals. The cofactors are expensive and for enzyme processes to be economically viable, it is essential to have some way of recycling the cofactors. We have demonstrated a novel approach for recycling a common cofactor called NADH. In collaboration with GSK, this project extends the approach to a related cofactor, NADPH, and demonstrates NADPH recycling for enzyme synthesis of pharmaceutically-relevant molecules.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Agritopics Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Analysis of ferritin iron in pea flour</gtr:description><gtr:id>C85724D9-46F5-44C5-A3CC-839901BFEE89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Peas are rich in nutrients and protein, but highly undervalued as a healthy part of our diet.

AgriTopics is a specialist agribusiness developing high value products from processed pea flours for the &amp;quot;free-from&amp;quot; (gluten-free) and health food markets.
In this project we tested the effect of different milling techniques on the extraction of ferritin. We also investigated the nutritional profile of pea flour before and after ferritin extraction. We found that a specialised milling process, developed and optimised by the Industry partner, is as good, or even better than a range of alternative milling processes for the extraction of ferritin. The extraction procedure removes sugars from the pea flour, but these are only 3 g / 100 g to start with. Fatty acids, protein and micronutrients remain in sufficient quantities for the flour to be used for food products.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac2da7866190.61083561-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Peas provide a rich source of proteins and nutrients for human diets. They also contain relatively high levels of iron in a special form which is very easy for the body to absorb. To extract this high value component or use pea flour directly in food products, the first step is to mill the dry peas. Together with the industrial partner AgriTopics, we will evaluate different milling procedures, milling fractions and particle sizes to optimize this first step for producing nutritional flour and iron extraction. The project will provide the basis for the development of new iron supplements, which could also be used clinically to treat iron deficiency anaemia, and specialist flours for the food industry.

PGMs are rare, exist in low concentrations and expensive to mine. It is essential that these metal reserves are utilised and recycled responsibly, not dispersed and lost into the environment. Plants can take up metals from their environment, and, in the case of PGMs, can deposit them as nanoparticles within their tissues. Nanoparticles have remarkable properties, when compared to the bulk of the same metal, which have been exploited. For example palladium nanoparticles are important catalysts for many pharmaceutical applications. Although currently synthesised chemically, we have shown that plants containing palladium nanoparticles can also be used to make efficient biocatalysts. These biocatalysts utilise carbon-neutral plant biomass, reduce processing steps by using the nanoparticles together with the plant material and concentrate valuable metals from waste sources. The addition of specific peptides (very small proteins) to solutions of metals increases nanoparticle formation, and alter size and shape; factors that can be used to optimise catalysts for different processes. This proposal is to investigate if expression of peptides in plants can be used to increase the formation, and control the size of, plant-derived biocatalysts.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Neil Bruce of University of York (POCMIB024)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AgriKinetics Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Investigating uptake and catalytic potential of miscanthus grown on palladium mine wastes</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8BBE4E2-31DC-4664-B5BC-4492655EE42C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac647757bda9.26692580-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We have shown that Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture can take up palladium, depositing it as nanoparticles.

Phytoextraction using field-relevant species could be a viable and environmentally sustainable method to re-green these sites while generating a catalytic product of higher value than the bulk metal. Our preliminary studies at the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (CNAP) have demonstrated that the grass, miscanthus, can take up palladium from synthetic mine wastes, but not yet at levels that confer catalytic activity. A major limitation to uptake is the insolubility of palladium in the wastes.

Water pollution is another global problem and causes over 14,000 deaths each day. By 2025, 1.7 billion people are faced with absolute water scarcity and two-thirds will have drinking water shortages. Unfortunately, many essential industrial activities contribute greatly to water pollution and more sustainable production methods or waste management practices are required to support the global demand for products but protect water sources.

However, the properties of galactomannans can be augmented by chemical modification. The traditional routes to modification require protecting groups and the use of non-aqueous solvents. However, enzymatic modification offers prospects of more sustainable routes to modified galactomannans. The galactomannan polymer is comprised of covalently linked sugar molecules, namely, mannose and galactose. Polymer hydrolysis resulting in chain shortening was demonstrated using a commercially available enzyme cellulase. Oxidation of the galactose sidechains within the polymer in aqueous solution was demonstrated using a commercially available enzyme, galactose oxidase. In addition, electrochemical oxidation of the galactose and mannose sugars was demonstrated by oxidation of aqueous guar suspensions at a graphite electrode.

Metals as cofactors of proteins and enzymes are essential for all of life, and metallo-proteins/enzymes represent a significant subgroup of commercially important enzymes/proteins. A potential problem for the use of metallo-enzymes is that their activity is wholly dependent on the cofactor (which is usually the active site at which the catalytic process occurs) and so the efficiency of production is dependent on the efficiency of cofactor insertion. Expression systems are capable of producing a target peptide up to 50% of total cell protein; in many cases, the metallo-cofactor and insertion apparatus of the cell cannot keep up with protein synthesis. This results in major inefficiencies in the production process. An obvious answer is to carefully match protein and cofactor synthesis/insertion. This can be achieved, in some cases at least, by slowing down the rate/reducing the extent of, protein synthesis such that the cofactor pathways can better keep up. However, this is unlikely to be suitable for a commercial context where achieving maximum yield is key. In 2015 we applied for and were awarded a PoC grant from the BBSRC Metals in Biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad4ffc54b967.16704649-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Metals as cofactors of proteins and enzymes are essential for all of life. Many metalloproteins have properties that are useful outside of the cell, for example in the synthesis of useful materials or medicines. However, to exploit this, the metalloprotein must be purified with the metallo-cofactor fully incorporated; incomplete incorporation results in major inefficiencies in the production process. A strategy to improve cofactor insertion is to more carefully match protein synthesis with cofactor synthesis/insertion. While in some cases this can be achieved by manipulation of the growth conditions, for example by slowing down protein synthesis, for commercial processes where protein yields are key, important economic and production benefits should be achievable through the engineering of cell factories to increase their capacity to incorporate the cofactor. In this project, the academic partners, who are experts in iron metabolism and iron-protein chemistry, propose to generate strains of E. coli that have significantly increased capacity to incorporate iron sulfur clusters and heme into a range of protein targets. These strains, together with growth protocols developed to use them to best effect, will be tested for the production of examples of commercially relevant iron-sulfur and heme proteins by the commercial partner.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Nick Le Brun of University of East Anglia (POCMIB002)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aeirtec</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Maximising Biomarker Detection Sensitivity through Metal Enhanced Fluorescence</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F80B5F2-B7F3-44A1-8068-3C5E6DFE9AFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This interaction voucher was used to develop a collaborative relationship on the production of protein-metallic nanoparticle conjugate materials, for use in Aeirtec's diagnostics platform. It particular, it concentrated on the bioconjugate chemistries needed for the immobilisation of these materials. Specifically, comparative analyses were conducted with various diamine linker molecules using a variety of protecting groups. Robust and quantifiable methods for linking fluorescence marker materials were developed and delivered to Aeirtec. From an academic perspective, the voucher was used to part-fund the research undertaken by students in Dr. Wong's laboratory. In particular, it provided the basis for a mini-project for one of our MSc students. It also part-funded two undergraduate summer internships and provided them with further research experience. Aeirtec has benefited from this interaction through access to chemistry in relation to our capacity to generate a metallic-protein microparticle surface. The interaction has now set a direction for incorporation of metals alongside proteins and microparticle identifying dyes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac58a9982dd4.33233180-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Fluorescence-based immunosorbent assays have become a key technology for detection and quantification of microbial contamination (in water, chemical, food and drug production), as well as for molecular biomarkers in agriculture, drug discovery, industrial biotechnology, medical diagnostics and cellular imaging.

Here, the selectivity of antibody binding combined with fluorescence spectroscopy, has led to huge advances in sensitivity, selectivity and speed. Typically, these assays employ an immobilised antibody to capture the target molecule from the test sample, followed by the immobilisation of a second antibody bearing a fluorescent label. To maximise the fluorescence output from the label, many researchers have started to harness metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) as a means to improve diagnostic sensitivity. Here, the co-location of the antibody in the vicinity of a metallic nanoparticle results in a large enhancement of fluorescence output (in the order of 100-fold). This project aims at improving the sensitivity of these MEF-based assay systems by the application of state-of-the-art bioconjugate methods to control the orientation of the immobilised antibodies with respect to the nanoparticle.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Stephen Kilfeather of University of Manchester (BIVMIB023)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Green Biologics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Metal utilisation in Clostridium microbial biocatalysts</gtr:description><gtr:id>501A8E93-B185-4DA8-BCDF-C11402B41D98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad4cd20c41c9.38543891-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Clostridium is an exemplar for microbial fermentations that convert biomass to renewable chemicals, such as butanol (with diverse uses including consumer fuels, paints and coatings and food additives) and acetone (used in cosmetics, plastics and numerous other markets). These fermentations depend upon metalloenzymes to convert starting material to product. The optimisation of metal supply is therefore critical for cost-efficiency. Currently, little is known about the metal requirements of industrial Clostridium species, or the metal circuitry important for maintaining metal supply to these pathways. We will identify the metal requirements during different fermentative processes and in different environments (batch vs. continuous; lab vs. industrial). Results will be applied to commercial operations for immediate outcomes including reducing waste and water use impacts. To further the development of Clostridium in a variety of IB processes, the metal sensor components of the metal circuitry will be identified to enable fine-tuning of metal supply pathways.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Peter Chivers of Durham University (BIVMIB035)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biocatalysts Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Optimisation of heme incorporation into a commercially important enzyme</gtr:description><gtr:id>6884D83A-7933-48CD-951E-BB582A9724C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aims of the project were met in that it was determined that:

Many metalloproteins have properties that are useful outside of the cell, for example in the synthesis of useful materials or medicines. However, to exploit this the metalloprotein must be purified with the metallo- cofactor fully incorporated, requiring a matching of protein and cofactor synthesis/insertion. In this project, the academic partners, who are experts in metalloprotein chemistry, will provide analyses of commercially generated metalloprotein samples to assist the commercial partner in solving a problem of highly variable cofactor insertion.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Nick Le Brun of University of East Anglia (BIVMIB003)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ZuvaSyntha Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cloning and metal analysis of recombinant aldehyde ferredoxin</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A761750-C1AF-4688-A076-55C06B373AD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac6345c92882.96703673-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The aim of the project is to enhance the recombinant production of a key enzyme of biotechnological importance with a view to the production of metalcofactor complete protein. Specifically, the aim is to find optimal conditions that allow for overproduction of recombinant aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR), an enzyme that allows the transformation of carboxylic acids into aldehydes. AOR has an unusual metal requirement in that it contains an oxotungsten centre bound to a pair of molybdopterin cofactors and a 4Fe4S cluster. We will clone two mesophilic forms of AOR from Clostridium ljungdahlii and another thermophilic form of the enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus. The enzyme will be produced with a Histag to allow for easy purification. Moreover, the protein will also be produced with a tag to allow for the protein to be targeted to a bacterial microcompartment (BMC).

A literature review and patent search were conducted to assess the current status of hyperspectral fluorescence imaging and multimodal MRI-optical imaging, both in biomedical applications and in industrial biotechnology.
