Determining the mechanism for direct incorporation of uranium into magnetite and green rust. Through the use of laboratory and synchrotron techniques, detailed elemental information has been determined to understand how uranium is incorporated into the iron (oxyhydr)oxide structure. In brief, U(VI) is seen to be reduced to a mixed oxidation state (U(VI)/U(V)/U(IV)) within each of the samples, with U(V)incorporated into the structure of magnetite and green rust samples (increase in Fe(II)). This work has been submitted for publication.
 
2. Developing both the laboratory and synchrotron beamline facilities at Diamond Light Source (DLS) for work involving radioactive substances. A two month placement was undertaken at the DLS where laboratory experiments were ran within the radiochemical laboratory. Additionally, samples containing uranium were analysed on two different beamlines; B18 (specroscopy) and I11 (diffraction). This was the first radioactive experiment to be ran on I11, and therefore developing the method for sample preparation was a key part of this project.
 
3. Determining the effect of uranium concentration on the magnetite structure. The data obtained during the summer placement in addition to other beamtimes investigated the effect of uranium concentration on magnetite. Magnetite was synthesised with a range of uranium concentrations (0.3-20 wt%) to determine the maximum amount of incorporation into magnetite and to determine the outcome of the remaining uranium. Additionally, the Fe(II) concentration was varied. Analysis of the data suggests that U(VI) is reduced to U(IV) as magnetite. The data is currently being analysed to gain further information.

4. Determining the mechanism of neptunium association with magnetite and green rust. Np X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (utilising I20, the new ultra dilute beamline at the Diamond Light Source) was used to show Np(V) was reduced to Np(IV) upon interaction with magnetite and green rust. The Np was then partial oxidised upon oxidation of the system, with (partial) incorporation into ferric (oxyhydr)oxides. This study utilised the newNp containments cell, recently developed by Env-Rad-Net</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Within the academic community, the findings from this project help to better understand the mechanism for uranium/neptunium incorporation into iron (oxyhydr)oxide phases and the effect concentration has on the mechanism for future research.
