The PI3K/AKT pathway is responsible for the control of many cellular processes including apoptosis, cell growth and proliferation. AKT (also known as PKB) is a protein kinase, ubiquitously expressed in most cells. It acts as an upstream signaling protein for many pathways that are vital for cell survival and replication. Studies of the Influenza virus have found that the viral protein NS1 is directly involved in activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Activation leads to negative regulation of apoptosis amongst other changes, which creates a more effective environment for virus entry and growth. 
Although the AKT locus has been identified in chickens, few studies have characterised the involvement of this viral evasion mechanism in this important livestock species. In this project we will characterize the role of AKT within chicken cells when infected by a virus, using both proteomic and molecular techniques. The virus to be used in this study is avian gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that causes infectious bronchitis (IB) in poultry. IB is an economically important disease that causes severe respiratory pathology in chickens of all ages. It is extremely detrimental to the poultry industry due to reduced egg production and quality of both egg and meat. Although vaccines exist against the virus, the high level of mutation that is associated with virus replication and numerous strains of the virus with poor cross-protectively means that the disease is difficult to control.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Innovate Guildford Outreach (12th March)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C98A49E-F88B-4D1C-86BB-686C24B4FE4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>With amazing exhibits, activities, workshops, talks and competitions, it's FREE to attend.

Among these interferon stimulated proteins, are the IFITM (interferon-inducible transmembrane) genes which have been shown to restrict the replication of several highly pathogenic human viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, filoviruses (Marburg virus and Ebola virus), influenza A viruses (IAVs), and flaviviruses (dengue virus). The Genetics and Genomics group have identified these antiviral proteins in the chicken (chIFITM) and have shown that a reduction in chIFITM expression results in an increase in the virus titre in CEFs infected with avian influenza A virus (AIV) H9N2, suggesting that chIFITMs have a functional role in the control of viral infections. The observation may have useful implications in terms of vaccine production. To this end, a patent was filed relating to the modification and testing of avian IFITMs, and has now been granted in multiple countries. Many vaccines have been produced in embryonated hen's eggs or continuous avian cell lines for more than 30 years. However, it is well established that the rate determining step in the manufacture of numerous vaccines is the induction of antiviral immune responses that prevents the replication of vaccine viruses. To generate chIFITM knock-down, we will use cutting edge genetic approaches such as siRNA and a CRISPR/Cas9 system which will directly target and knock-out chIFITM expression. We believe that this approach will overcome the rate limiting step in vaccine production, directly resulting in increased vaccine yields and improve the speed at which vaccines can be manufactured. We are currently in talks with major vaccine producers keen to adopt this internationally patented technology, to advance the field of both animal and human vaccine production.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>BBS/E/I/00001758</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>ADE66B28-615C-4CDB-9BF5-D827977F1A00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work has arisen as a result of an Animal Health Research Club grant.

The gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is endemic in most countries around the world and causes infectious bronchitis in poultry. Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease that results in reduced egg production and can be fatal in young birds. All viruses modulate cellular processes to establish themselves within the cell. The AKT signalling pathway is a host pathway often modified by viruses and plays a crucial role in the regulation of many cellular processes. We have studied the activation of the AKT signalling pathway and downstream processes such as apoptosis, autophagy and macropinocytosis during IBV infection. Here we show that IBV infection induces activation of AKT in a PI3K dependent manner. In avian cells this activation occurs in a biphasic manner at both an early and late time point during infection. We have shown that IBV requires an active PI3K/AKT pathway for efficient replication and that over expression of several viral proteins has been found to cause activation of AKT. Furthermore we have investigated how this activation allows modulation of downstream pathways such as apoptosis, autophagy and macropinocytosis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This study highlights the importance of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway during IBV infection and may be applied to other human and livestock coronaviruses for development of therapeutics or novel vaccines.

Multiple stably-expressed reference genes can be used to control random technical variation between samples. It is necessary to select reference genes with the lowest variation in representative samples. The candidate reference gene assays must be reliable. In particular, they should have high amplification specificity and efficiency, and not produce signals from contaminating DNA. Whilst recent research papers identify specific genes that are stable in particular tissues and experimental treatments, here we describe a panel of ten avian gene primer and probe sets that can be used to identify suitable reference genes in many experimental contexts. The panel was tested with TaqMan and SYBR Green systems in two experimental scenarios, a tissue collection, and virus infection of cultured fibroblasts. GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms were able to select appropriate reference gene sets in each case. We show the effects of using the selected genes on the detection of statistically significant differences in expression. The results are compared with those obtained using 28s ribosomal RNA, the present most widely accepted reference gene in chicken work, identifying circumstances where the use of this gene might provide misleading results.
Widely used methods for eliminating DNA contamination of RNA reduced, but did not completely remove, detectable DNA. We therefore attached special importance to testing each qPCR assay for absence of signal using DNA template.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CCB66E62-A751-423C-9EA9-969D57A82407</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The assays and analyses developed here provide a useful resource for selecting reference genes for investigations of avian biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd8d8d814b83.18266752</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A Versatile Panel of Reference Gene Assays for the Measurement of Chicken mRNA by Quantitative PCR</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>SAL1 Patent for Salmonella resistance in chickens&amp;quot;-.
