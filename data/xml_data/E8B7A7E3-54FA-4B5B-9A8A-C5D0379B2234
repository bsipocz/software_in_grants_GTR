The novelty of the framework is in its ability to enable the maximisation of value in sustainable decisions involving waste fractions ('qualities'). It is desired to develop these optimisation approaches initially for the valuable and environmentally-significant problem of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) reverse logistics, and subsequently for more generic challenges. Note. The optimisation technique described here would be classified by NERC as a technology. The focus is on developing this technology for this and subsequent applications. The application of the technology is in sustainable development, which falls within NERC's remit. The technology will enable sustainable science. There is clearly a need for sustainable science within waste management to advance its practice. OWL will initially develop an optimised reverse logistics system for WEEE covered by the WEEE directive, which includes large and small household appliances, IT and telecommunications equipment, consumer equipment such as TVs, videos and hi-fi, lighting, small electrical and electronic tools, toys, leisure and sports equipment, automatic dispensers, medical devices and monitoring and control instruments. Producers designate collection points for the recycling of WEEE; many are provided at Civic Amenity Sites. When the collection points are full, producers belonging to a compliance scheme take the WEEE away. The cost of WEEE not being collected is measurable by its landfill charges. WEEE quantities are of waste arisings or their forecasts. Prices of recovered components are available through the recycling markets. Transport costs and emissions are estimated from Civic Amenity Site and onward processor locations. It is therefore feasible to maximise value and identify the fractions contributing to it. Indeed, not only is it feasible, it is a commercially attractive idea. Market prices are available though subject to uncertainty, but optimisation does not take place to maximise overall value within the constraint of sustainability. The potential for extra value is considerable: 1.8 m and rising tonnes of WEEE are generated in the UK each year, and it has been estimated that mixed WEEE is often charged at &amp;pound;150/tonne or more to scheme members . Hence even only a 2% system-wide improvement would be worth &amp;pound;5.4 m per year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7729</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Seeking to trial the decision support methodology in a real commercial environment, a proposal was made to ESRC on the &amp;quot;Acceptability of Large-Scale Energy Retrofit for Residential Dwellings in the UK&amp;quot;.

OWL Pathfinder explored the application of the methodology to the Waste Electronics sector, which is a high cost business with high environmental impacts, and thus one in which even small percentage improvements would have high value. However the methodology is generic and broadly applicable. The next steps taken are to pilot the methodology in decisions on implementation of energy efficiency retrofits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The core decision analysis approach, using participatory narrative structuring methods for developing decision-making frameworks is available.
