In many of the post-event analyses, the security problem is understood to be how to take action on the basis of uncertain, unforeseen and unanticipated events.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The SaFE fellowship will advance knowledge and understanding of these futures-oriented and pre-emptive security. The progamme is organised around three thematic streams:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;inferred futures, or how future threats can be inferred in advance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>enacting decision, or how action can be taken even where information is partial or fragmentary&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>publics and proportionality, or how judgements can be reached on what is a proportionate pre-emptive security measure. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Within the fellowship, a programme of research will focus specifically on the deployment of digital data and analytics within border security programmes. &lt;br />The research objectives are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to generate new empirical knowledge of, and conceptual tools for understanding, how data elements from past events can become actionable indicators of future possible terrorism threat&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to identify and assess the extent to which protocols for the analysis of indicators of future threat events produce codified responses&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to expand the scope for practitioner and public engagement with new forms of border security technologies and data devices.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ESRC's delivery plan (2011-15) identifies a key strategic priority to &amp;quot;create a better understanding of how and why people and organisations make decisions, and how these can be managed and influenced&amp;quot; (page 5). This priority intersects with the cross-council Global Uncertainties priority to &amp;quot;realise greater security for all in a changing world&amp;quot;, precisely because current understandings of how and why people and organisations make security decisions lack attention to the technological intersection of commercial, governmental, political, and public decisions about risk and threat. For example, in data from my past projects, the commercial designers of algorithms for crowded place security have reported in interviews that they are unsure how their &amp;quot;model designed to detect insurance fraud&amp;quot; is different from &amp;quot;the mathematically similar model used for border controls&amp;quot; in the eyes of the public. From a different perspective, government agencies charged with securing the border report that they want commercial suppliers to &amp;quot;automate the kinds of decisions our experienced staff are making every day&amp;quot;. 
The SaFE fellowship responds directly to the need for better understanding of security decisions made under conditions of profound uncertainty about future threats, with specific emphasis on engaging commercial, governmental and 'third sector' beneficiaries.
Who will benefit from this research? - the beneficiaries of the SaFE fellowship include: commercial bodies with interest in the development and application of technologies that pre-empt future threat events (e.g. IBM; SITA; CapGemini; Thales; Augmentiq); governmental and policy making authorities with a remit to consider and to deploy new forms of 'future risk' oriented security (e.g. UKBA; Koninklijke Marechaussee; European Commission; European Parliamentary Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs); and 'third sector' and public bodies with a stake in deliberating the societal effects of new security measures (e.g. UK Information Commissioner; European Data Protection Supervisor, Peter Hustinx; UK and European legal advocates who confront a new 'vocabulary' of risk in national security cases; representatives of charitable sector, such as National Council for Voluntary Organisations, NCVO, and Islamic Relief).
How will they benefit from this research? - With regard to the commercial and industrial stakeholders across the GU programme, they will benefit from the programme of leadership activities because it will afford opportunities to share their applications and systems 'problem spaces' and to devise new approaches from other sectors (e.g. partnerships, future leaders residencies, knowledge exchange workshops). Within the border security domain that is the focus of the personal research, the commercial beneficiaries will gain greater understanding of what happens to their algorithmic models when the system is 'retuned' by governement priorities or adapted within the PIU. This matters because the commercial suppliers tell us they have little feedback knowledge on the experiential and onward life of their systems in situ, and that there may be ways to 'design in' adaptation.
With respect to the governmental authorities, the primary beneficiary will be the UKBA, whose 'in kind' partnership will ensure that the insights from pre-emptive techniques used in other threat domains can be used to the full. The Fellow is also involved in the ongoing negotiations between EU and US on PNR sharing - the research will be crucial to ensuring that attention is paid to the public and democratic effects between data gathering and risk analytics.
Finally, the SaFE fellowship will develop ongoing engagement with a wide range of bodies whose advocacy work is transformed by new security practices - for example, charities whose compliance with new border security practices demands new ways of working.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>425974</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ITS United Kingdom</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with International Air Transport Association (IATA)</gtr:description><gtr:id>728C1B6F-7B72-4DF8-A8E9-CC069E9B4580</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Confidential output - 10,000 word report.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df2f11342a07.88009752-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Hosting of PDRA; sharing of data; invited our team to participate in AvSec meeting, Dublin 2015.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>1.

Following the presentation of the final report to the international organisation, our research team was invited to present the report to an invited audience of government and industry practitioners. This has led to further engagement with the Australian borders projects, including a knowledge exchange visit in the summer of 2016.

With regard to the research, the team conducted more than 100 interviews with, and non-participant observations of, the different actors involved in collecting, preparing, analysing and actioning data for security decisions. These ranged from national and European borders authorities, to software designers, regulators, security analysts, and aviation and transport security authorities. The analysis of this unique dataset has produced the following overall project findings:
1. The use of statistical and probabilistic methods of data analysis for securing against uncertainty has transformed dramatically in the period after 2001. Where traditional methods used historical data to extract fixed profiles of risk, extrapolating past patterns into the future, the emerging methods have a different relationship to past and future. The availability of real-time data streams from the Internet has supplied data that is not strictly 'historical' in the conventional sense. This new approach visualises uncertainty and risk through correlative links and associations rather than through causality or probability. 
2. If the securing of future events such as terrorist attacks has moved to more mobile and flexible forms of data analysis, the evidence points overwhelmingly to a dramatic shift in what is meant by 'data collection', 'analysis' and 'decision'. The collection of specific security-related data in structured databases and lists is no longer as significant as the use of large volumes of 'bulk' data, from which patterns and anomalies are detected. 
3. The new spaces of 'securing against future events' include technical and computational architectures such as cloud computing, algorithmic and automated filtering, and distributed databases. These spaces involve novel combinations of human and machine decision-making, where the &amp;quot;human in the loop&amp;quot; is often required to validate an algorithmic security decision. For many practitioners and analysts, it remains an extraordinarily complex architecture for which they are required to take responsibility. However, in the instances where the steps of a security decision are to be re-traced and checked, the algorithmic methods are not meaningfully within the visible threshold of human oversight.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of ways in which the findings will be taken forward/put to use.

1. Investigations of futurity and the claim upon the future made by security decisions, particularly where these are made by composites of humans and algorithms.
2. Empirical work on cloud computing and the implications of cloud space for security practice. This remains a critical problem for practitioners, for whom cloud data appears to offer new possibilities for data gathering and analysis. 
3. A revisiting of the principles of oversight, integrity, accountability, and privacy on which public relationships to the security decision are based. These principles relate to the prior forms of statistical and profile-based data analysis and, as yet, they have not been revisited to assess their adequacy for algorithmic forms of security.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>44A8C570-7F64-4489-A5D4-FBF8E0668FE3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df4584bf4a59.69977726</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Testimony before UK Parliamentary Science and Technology Select Committee on Biometric Technologies</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>712B641A-C8F3-48B9-8885-45216FFE21FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The contribution to the inquiry focused specifically on the new techniques through which biometric data can be linked to other internet data (structured and unstructured data).
