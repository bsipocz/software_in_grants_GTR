It examines how households have formed their livelihoods and what evidence there is of resilience and agency and of constraints imposed by the institutional contexts in which the households function. The study will return to 15 of the original 21 study villages, spread across 5 of the original 7 provinces where the study of rural livelihoods was conducted in 2002-03. It will revisit a subset of the original study households within each of these villages, integrating cross-sectional, retrospective and prospective elements into a longitudinal panel research design. It will draw out guided narratives about everyday life experiences among male and female respondents from each household, focusing on major events experienced and hazards negotiated; current livelihood activities and outcomes; and how and why livelihood activities and outcomes have changed. It will use a multi-level research approach to link analysis of change at the micro level to changes within the meso and macro level contexts. This will illuminate the structural, historical and institutional factors affecting efforts to build secure livelihoods in rural Afghanistan, and how some families and individuals have more room to manoeuvre than others and what that means to poverty outcomes over time. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been used in round tables and other engagement with Afghan policy makers in the period just after the study ended.

Policies focused primarily on growth and markets, which do not consider who will benefit and how, are unlikely to reach the most poor or fulfil their needs.&amp;quot;

The Afghanistan Livelihood Trajectories project builds on the results of a prior AREU study conducted in 2003-04. Through case studies in Faryab, Badakhshan, Sar-i-Pul and Kandahar Provinces, it examines patterns of change in rural household livelihoods over the course of the past decade, informed by changes in contexts within which people lead their lives and the practices they implement to cope with these changes. 

Findings from the studies suggest that many rural households in drought-hit northern provinces are poorer now than they were at the start of the decade. Despite development aid that has brought tangible improvements in the provision of education, healthcare and clean drinking water, the daily struggle to put food on the table remains the overwhelming concern for many village households. Policymakers in recent years have generally overlooked this reality, restricting their focus to simple GDP growth. Yet people in rural Afghanistan are increasingly caught in a poverty trap with few escape routes. 

Poverty reduction must remain a major focus of policymakers if Afghanistan is to achieve lasting economic security. Future efforts to this end must ensure that the concerns of rural Afghans such as failed harvests, ill-health and crippling marriage costs are addressed, and that programming takes the systemic causes of poverty into account as well as provides technical assistance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They can inform NGO development programs focused on livelihoods and poverty reduction; they highlight the need for much more engagement with context and political economy analysis in the design of livelihood development programs.

They can inform Afghan and donor policy and prioritization in relation to balance between security and development agendas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8FA66FB5-9D10-4A35-97FE-C027C2011685</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce1023bc216.64041106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.areu.org.af</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/F026080/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-167-25-0285</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
