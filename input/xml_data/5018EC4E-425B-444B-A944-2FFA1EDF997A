This art is starting to be collected by museums, galleries and private collectors, including Tate, Victoria and Albert Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and National Taiwan Museum of Fine Art. Although there is much research published on the use of new media as a collections management, online documentation or museum education tool, there is very little published material to help arts workers and academics with collecting new media art itself. In particular, collecting new media art that is interactive or participative can offer useful case studies to inform the current interest in participation across contemporary art, because it fundamentally affects the role of the audience in relation to art. If art collections can be tagged or selected by users themselves, then this also changes the relationship between audiences and collections. 

The CRUMB resource  aims to help curators, academics and arts workers with these new challenges, by sharing examples of projects, by curating exhibitions of new media art, and by publishing analytical writing on the different histories of new media art. CRUMB has an international network of specialists in the field, and has undertaken consultancy for the Arts Council of England, amongst others. In 2010, CRUMB was invited by the national organisation Contemporary Art Society to collaborate on the symposium 'Commissioning and Collecting Variable Media' which included speaker Benjamin Weil, formerly of SFMOMA. Also in 2010, Beryl Graham and Sarah Cook's authored book Rethinking Curating: Art after New Media contained elements on collections, and audience, but these need to be developed and expanded. 

Professor Beryl Graham's Fellowship therefore seeks to spend time developing research on collecting new media art, in relation to audience, and will have outcomes in the form of a book, and interviews and other material on the CRUMB web site.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research impact plan is based on what has worked particularly well in previous CRUMB methods and outputs, with particular targets for policy-level, professional and media impacts. Because CRUMB often uses collaborative and participative methods of research, including workshops and the active CRUMB discussion list, the co-producers, 'users' and beneficiaries of the research overlap productively. 

The beneficiaries of the research include artists, arts and media workers, curators, and a wider public interested in culture and technology, as well as academics. They benefit not only as 'receivers' of high-quality publications, but also as participants in discussion and the development of new debates. 

Mechanisms for ensuring benefit are based on past experience of fully-booked events, feedback and evaluation of exhibitions, and well distributed publications (the MIT book Rethinking Curating went to reprint after 9 months, and has sold over 2400 copies to March 2011). Particular efforts are being made to make the book well-illustrated, and hence of wider appeal than some academic books.

By encouraging public and private buyers to collect new media artworks, the research is of obvious commercial and economic benefit to artists. By including international collections in the research, this would include benefits to British artists from abroad, and advice has been sought from British Council concerning how this can be of most benefit. There is also economic benefit in Ashgate selling books abroad.

At a governmental, policy and public sector level, past consultancy work for Arts Council England North West will feed into a possible future consultancy for The British Council concerning commissioning new media art for collection. Past policy panels concerning new media collections at Institute for Network Cultures in Amsterdam and Tate in London will carry forward into ongoing research networks. Past symposia with attendance by, and policy-level feedback to Arts Council England such as the CRUMB/CAS Symposium on Commissioning and Collecting Variable Media in 2010, and the Harris Museum symposium Current: An Experiment in Collecting Art Debate, will inform this research and future symposia. The research therefore aims to improve the benefits of research expertise offered to policy bodies, and to inform collecting policies internationally. 

Professional and practitioner groups: Past work with the bodies above makes the most of existing strong professional networks, and feeds into policy-level research. Past professional development and masterclass events at an international level, including Caitlin Jones at AV Festival 08, and at Eyebeam New York in 2009, showed a high demand, and aim to continue professional/academic knowledge transfer.

Museums and galleries are of obvious importance for curatorial research, and by producing publications and a web site specifically aimed to be of use to professionals, research can be seen to be useful. By including medium-sized regional galleries such as Harris in Preston, and online collections, a more widely accessible approach is intended.

Local communities and the wider public are addressed via the web site and discussion list, which are free and open to all. The organisations involved also run workshops as well as more formal events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Advising curator Lucy Dusgate on the Lowry's first exhibition of digital art, and writing the catalogue essay:

CRUMB has developed a long-term strand of research concerning collecting art. Lindsay Taylor, Exhibitions Officer at Harris Museum and Art Gallery has been developing the exhibition, audience development and collection of new media art at a regional art museum for over 10 years, forging a strong national identity for the museum, with ongoing support from CRUMB. Graham was involved in developing the Digital Aesthetic conference and exhibition at the Harris in 2001, and 2007. In 2010 the Exhibitions Officer of Harris attended the Commissioning &amp;amp; Collecting Variable Media CRUMB/CAS conference at BALTIC, which specifically aimed to develop the collection of new media art in the UK, and was attended by 100 national and international curators (http://www.crumbweb.org/getSeminarDetail.php?id=14). In 2011, the Harris collaborated with digital arts commissioning agency folly on Current: an experiment in collecting digital art project. Cook was invited to serve on the Board of folly, and Graham was invited to be on the exhibition selection panel, and co-chaired with Cook the symposium Collecting Digital Art at Harris. The project was an integrated approach informed by the Commissioning &amp;amp; Collecting Variable Media event, and the research of the unit, involving an open call for works, selection of exhibition, followed by selection of one work from the exhibition to collect. Importantly, audience views on which artwork should be collected were taken into account as well as expert panels (the audience and the experts agreed, and the work selected was a work by Thomson and Craighead using live data pulled from the internet - a conceptually and technologically complex work). This reflects much CRUMB research on the importance of audience in curating new media art. 

The long-term support of CRUMB contributed to changing the collection policy of the museum to specifically include new media art (Harris 2011, p.62): the first moving image piece entered the Harris collection in 2000, and the first new media artwork entered the collection in 2012, by Thomson and Craighead. The institutional structure for acquisition changed by involving a panel of judges, technical staff, and the audience itself, in the selection of works to collect. CAS and The Art Fund supported the Current project, and in May 2013 further awarded &amp;pound;30,000 to the Harris to collect more new media art (CAS 2011). Acquisition fees were &amp;pound;10,000 for Current alone, and so economic impact was felt by organisations and artists. Graham was invited to chair a panel on new media art including the Exhibitions Officer at the 2010 Museums Association Conference, and the Exhibitions Officer was also invited by Graham to write a chapter for the forthcoming book New Collecting: Exhibiting and Audiences after New Media Art (Taylor 2014), in order to share the curatorial knowledge more widely and hence further impact on the policy of other curators. Graham was interviewed by the Financial Times: How to Spend It magazine concerning collecting, and highlighted the Harris' policy, including economic impact (Crichton-Miller 2012). Lindsay Taylor has stated that: &amp;quot;The Harris now has a number of works in permanent collection for future generations to enjoy - I doubt this would have been possible without the support offered by CRUMB&amp;quot;

New media art is increasingly being collected by both commercial and museums, and CRUMB has been involved in many events aimed to impact upon this: The Curating Art after New Media - Professional Development Course in Central London had as attendees curators from Hong Kong, Austria, The Netherlands, Ireland, USA and the UK, and included visits to discuss with curators at organisations including: 
Design Museum, Science Museum, Tate, V&amp;amp;A, Wellcome Collection and 
British Library Labs, including the curators at V&amp;amp;A who have a chapter in the book outcome New Collecting (http://www.macurating.net/shortcourse.htm). Feedback forms from the event stated that 100% of attendees felt that their future practice would be changed by the workshop. 

Beryl Graham was an invited member of the Tate New Media Art Network on Authenticity and Performativity, which impacted collection of new media art at Tate. Since this research, she has been invited to be on the Project Advisory Board of EU project PERICLES on digital preservation, based at Tate. She was invited to speak at the Cultural Value and the Digital symposium at Tate Modern (Tate, RCA and LSBU 2014).

She has also been invited to speak on collecting at the following symposia, and hence influence policy in both museums and cultural industry sectors as well as academic (see publications):
