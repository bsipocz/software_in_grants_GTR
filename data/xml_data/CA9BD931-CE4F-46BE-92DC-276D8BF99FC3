Community</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M006646/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This study explores how doctors across their professional careers utilise moral resources to navigate the complex world of healthcare in an era of markets and user choice. The dual aims are first to understand the nature of phronesis (practical wisdom) transmission, interpretation and enactment by doctors through medical education and into practice and second to develop an arts based methodology to reliably frame phronesis in the institutions that participate in the study and that can be used in the study of phronesis in other professions (e.g. teachers and lawyers). 

To date little research has explored the ways in which phronesis is cultivated over a period of time within one professional community. There is an absence of research with medical professionals to explore how they have accumulated and enacted phronesis within their daily practice. Questions have rarely been asked as to how professionals are equipped morally (or otherwise) to navigate a chaotic world of practice rife with competing demands and relationships. To date, many researchers within medicine have made the case for a reorientation towards phronesis in medical education, but little has been undertaken to explore what that might look like.

Existing studies have tended to capture practical wisdom within one snapshot, within one organisation or by following one practitioner. In this study three communities of doctors over three time periods will be studied: beginning of formal medical study; on placement at the end of formal study; and established medical professionals with 5 years plus qualified experience. This design will offer an opportunity to see how phronesis develops over time whilst enabling a varied discussion about how moral resources are accessed and what the role of formal education is in equipping practitioners for the messy realities of practice.

By exploring how doctors at different points in their careers have access to or draw upon moral resources, we are interested to see how they make 'good' decisions for the patient at hand; balancing care, compassion, quality, resources, capacity, medical outcomes and the wider well-being of the community. The participants will be involved in creatively shaping an original 'soap opera' style series of video clips that will connect to an existing virtual community of health and social care practitioners, patients and the public. The purpose is to engage them in providing an artistic interpretation through which they see the issues of phronesis in their practice arena. The soap opera and the way it links to the community will be debated with a broad audience of academics, practitioners, patients and policy makers and others with an interest in the field. Through this process we expect to be informed and challenged e.g. about our approach, the teaching of ethics, public engagement and public trust. 

The video series will be available through the AHRC website and other mediums such as DVD and YouTube. A report, journal and conference papers will become a resource for Connected Communities researchers, medical education practitioners, wider academia and health and social care communities to utilise. The video series will offer an innovative, edgy complement to the many text based recommendations that have emanated from scandal enquiry reports and social science based studies to date. 

New understandings of the cultivation of phronesis in medical communities and its role in rebuilding public trust in the light of many scandals will be of interest to healthcare researchers, educators, practitioners and policymakers. Specific value to the AHRC Connected Community programme through the arts based methodology is expected. The project aims to deliver a return on the AHRC's investment by impacting on the medical and professional education of doctors as a community, building stronger links between the medical community and the public and rebuilding public confidence in the medical profession.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impacts will be to increase the effectiveness of health services and enhancing health and well being all within the time-frame of the research. The methodology developed will be applicable to other sectors such as care, education, law and business and therefore the research promises much wider economic benefit and competitiveness for the UK. Immediate beneficiaries include: 

1. Patients - by a refocusing of clinical care on the 'good action' and the practise of professional virtues within the context of the patient at hand. Francis (2013) makes a direct link between healthcare professionals' values and patient care. Although both the GMC (2013) and Francis (2013) emphasise the importance to patient care and safety of virtues in good professional practice neither highlight the means of how to achieve phronesis and virtuous professional practice. This project will contribute to the means in order to achieve these re-stated aims and benefit patients in the process.

2. General Public - virtually all citizens of the UK receive care from doctors in the NHS and have an interest in being treated with dignity and receiving good care, which are inextricably linked with phronesis and good professional values (Good Medical Practice GMC 2013).

3. Medical Students and Doctors - by improved facilitation of the accumulation of practical ethical wisdom and appropriate guidance to develop professional values based on situational virtue. Study participants will have the scope to reflect and upon and discuss their clinical actions, implications and alternative ways of acting in a safe environment. In addition, greater patient satisfaction and outcomes which will lead to greater job satisfaction for clinicians and reduce stress levels (Corley 2001). There is evidence that doctors become psychologically compromised (Shale 2012) when the right course of action is unclear or where there are competing ethical demands and the pathway of the virtuous or good doctor is not clear.

4. Allied health care professionals - doctors acting as good role models as members of multi-disciplinary teams (typical in the provision of secondary care) will improve interaction and influence the allied health contingent within the membership. Also educational tools and good doctor role models will create the opportunity for any interacting health care professional to acquire their own practical wisdom as they emulate and copy medics in the team (Hilli et al 2013).

5. NHS - many current complaints are focused on poor or non-virtuous attitudes of staff towards patients (Health Service Ombudsman 2011). Doctors and medical students realigning their professional values to focus on virtues will improve patient experience, safety and care within the NHS. It is generally acknowledged that better care leads to better clinical outcomes and improved patient experiences (Health Service Ombudsman 2011). As a result the NHS will produce better patient outcomes and will receive fewer complaints which in turn will lead to better financial performance.
6. Medical Schools and Health Education England - by improving education of medical ethics and professional values. This would enable medical educators to be better able to meet the objectives of the requirements of the medical regulators, government and the DOH. In particular, the requirements of the GMC in 'Tomorrows Doctors', MLCF and post-graduate medical curricula will have new methods to meet the demands and definitions of good medical practice.

7. Other professional groups - this research will offer transferable learning to other equally affected sectors, particularly social care because some of the information produced and insights gained will be applicable to other professional environments and groups. This is particularly timely given the crises in public confidence about the professional values and lack of virtuous practice in banking, the media, social care, the police, etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>651405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Effectively a soap opera style depiction of the findings to convey some of the stories, themes and serial of ethical decision making.

collaboration with collaborative partners at the Universities of Warwick and Nottingham. In
addition, NHS ethical approval (if required) will be sought for the collaborative NHS partners.

The main data collection will be through interviews with four groups of participants from each of the 3
institutions (Birmingham, Warwick and Nottingham) and a 5 years plus experienced group:
? 10x3 medical students at the beginning of formal medical study (year2)
? 10x3 medical students at the end of formal medical study (year 5)
? 10x3 doctors who are on placement in their foundation years at the end of formal study (F1
and F2) - a transitional cohort to offer a longitudinal flexibility to the study of practical wisdom whilst
enabling a varied discussion about how moral resources are accessed and what the role of formal
education is in equipping practitioners for the messy contingencies of practice.
? 10 established medical professionals with 5 years plus qualified experience.
Interviews will start with an open declaration of the interests of the study and initially involve gaining
an understanding of what phronesis means to the interviewee.


Lead a review of medical ethics and professional virtues in teaching at the medical schools at the Universities of
Birmingham, Nottingham and Warwick.

Members of the Steering Group will include each of the formal
collaborative partners: medical schools and hospital trusts of Birmingham, Nottingham and
Warwick, Health Education England, and there will also be patient, lay, medical student and doctor
representation, and representation from a Clinical Commissioning Group on the Steering Group as
well as academics and professionals from a range of related disciplines.


All three
representative members from Birmingham, Warwick and Nottingham Medical Schools have
responsibility for ethics teaching within the medical undergraduate curriculums. This positioning will
allow them to incorporate video clips directly into existing teaching of ethics and will also allow
them to generate a curriculum review of medical ethics and professional values teaching within
their own medical schools and make recommendations for modifications or amendments to the
existing teaching programmes on the basis of the study's findings.

The Universities of Birmingham, Nottingham and Warwick will disseminate findings and the video
product to other allied health care professional courses and other professional courses within their
immediate academic network. The Professor of Academic Innovation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital
(official collaborative partner) will explore ways to further disseminate research findings and video
product within the NHS, to allied health care professionals, patient representation groups and NHS
workers through secondary care hospital networks, and the Department of Health. Dr Jameel of
West Midlands Health Education England (as an official collaborative partner) will explore ways to
use the network of National Health Education England in order to disseminate the findings and
video product to other post-graduate medical educators.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Conroy (PI) is a Senior Fellow at HSMC will lead all activities including the collaborations to ensure that the project's aims and

show the progression from the contained environment of medical school to interactions with other
professions, hospital boards, the community in the form of patients' family, patient representatives,
pressure groups, press reports etc. Stilwell provides this all important contextualisation as it already
contains a hospital, GP practices, all the associated health professions as well as social services,
ambulance services, police force, fire services etc. plus a whole community of characters who interact
with the services as patients, carers, family, friends etc. This project will add a medical school to the
community and through the video series will provide insight into the cultivation of phronesis through
the life of a maturing doctor (or group of doctors) and also the community response to the enactment
of phronesis all informed by the stories we collect from the participants.

UoC will be responsible for development of new resources under the Stilwell platform (see
www.stilwelleducation.com) to address an identified market need within the medical community. The
resources (new characters and scenarios) will be integrated into the existing Stilwell Virtual Community
and made freely available to project partners.

Very early days re the findings but the first project workshop clearly stimulated much interest from delegates. A second workshop is planned for 6 April with a much larger group of academics, practitioners, policymakers and patient representatives invited.

A tangible impact on future policy that has emerged recently is that the whistle blower at Mid Staffs, A&amp;amp;E Consultant Chris Turner, heard about our project and has joined our Steering Group and initiated the marketing group to help us engage with policy makers and others to make a difference to the way ethical decisions are being made right now by the medical community. 

Many of the participants (medical students, junior doctors and experienced doctors) have reported that the interviews provided a space to reflect on their ethical decision making practice which they do not normally have chance to do. They particularly said that it was good to understand for themselves the different considerations (virtues) that they took into account before making a decision. This will hopefully help them in improving their ethical decision making moving forward. 

The findings will eventually be presented back to wider groups of students and doctors to help them debate the best ways of making ethical decisions in different situations.

Magnificence, Pride, Anger, Truth and Indignation). MacIntyre was careful to avoid such
definitions, and we therefore allowed the accounts from our workshop practitioners to
define the virtues of connectedness in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Using a virtue continuum lens we
mapped stories of connected communities from our workshop participants (Figure 1 - see the URL report).

Within the workshop we heard examples of practice which countered policy and practice
impositions perceived as potentially disruptive of communities by pre-defining the terms
of engagement: the focus was the incremental development of working relationships 
within and across communities, engaging with the learning in communities and seeking

Despite having professional lives that are rife with competing demands and relationships, questions have rarely been asked about what professionals need in order to be equipped morally (or otherwise) to deal with these. The most ethically challenging decisions in any organisation are often cases in which there are multiple conflicting moral and functional goals that a leader feels bound to pursue. For instance, in medical settings, a consultant must weigh up the different benefits that they can pursue for their patients - should they seek to prolong life or ease pain in the palliative care setting? The good for a particular patient must also be weighed up against the good for others - for instance, who, out of a range of suitable patients, should benefit from an organ transplant when only one organ is available. Or, when five patients require emergency operations to save life or limb, who should benefit from being at the front of the queue? Even when it is clear initially what benefit or outcome to pursue, there are often multiple ways in which this outcome or an alternative can be reached - is it best, for instance, to prescribe a drug, advise on nutrition, advocate surgery or allow the patient to choose. This is often further complicated by co-morbidities such as obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and so on.

When faced with such uncertainty, whether this be in a medical setting or otherwise, the response of many leaders, is to reach for the rule-book - that is, to make ever more intricate guidelines, protocols and procedures to determine what must be done in morally fraught situations. Over the last 25 years 73 clinical guidelines could be found in PubMed in 1990 and 7,508 in 2012 indicating a significant growth in clinical practice guidelines . However, in the face of this tide of ever-closer codification of good medical practice, many clinicians bemoan the loss of their professional autonomy with practitioners noting the inability of these guidelines to take into account the complexity of caring for patients with multiple comorbidities. In one reported instance, practitioners resisted (and, practically speaking, sabotaged) one system that attempted to codify and constrain physicians' decisions. The paradox for leaders as they govern practice today is this: whilst these rule-based mechanisms are supposed to bring clarity, accuracy and consistency to decision making and make it easy to know what to do, leaders themselves experience the growth of rules, guidelines and procedures as alienating, confusing and even demeaning. They also recognise the artificial work as imagined perspective of these guidelines: they tend to oversimplify the complexity of the clinical situation, making patients single-pathology entities rather than the complex multifaceted (medically and socially) humans that they are.


The early findings are just being put together now. Here is a taster:

Our preliminary conclusions from the lit review are as follows:
Practical wisdom - or phronesis - can help leaders in medical and other professional contexts lead more ethically in at least three ways: 
1) An understanding that good and wise decision making for people who consider themselves ethical leaders goes beyond following a set of guidelines or rules or working out the consequences of their actions but also requires the ability to discern the relevant virtues with their colleagues. 

2) Even when those virtues are discerned (e.g. courage, justice, prudence, etc.), knowing where to act on each virtue continuum (vice to vice via a mean) requires the development of the phronesis that can be regarded as the adjudicating or executive virtue.

3) Phronesis needs to be cultivated over time to offer a way to balance competing demands, relationships, multiple conflicts and a range of functional goals to find an ethical decision point that will bring good outcomes for their discipline, the professionals who are part of their profession and the people they serve with their services. 

Like in my prior AHRC study (Conroy 2012), we have explored the ethics of decision making by using a narrative approach with practitioners . Stories told by practitioners to a researcher may or may not be what actually happened; however, they contribute to the 'pool of meanings' and support the social construction of ethics and decision making in a given professional community. Like in the previous study we used MacIntyre's virtue ethics and the theory of phronesis to present a mapping of what we called virtue continuums for the medical community . The virtue continuums were based on the stories told by the participants and showed where on the continuums each of their stores was located, hence the claimed phronesis. This mapping showed for each virtue narrated by the community of practitioners there is a continuum from vice to vice via a median. What we have subsequently proposed is that there is a median point in each case, arrived at via conducting a moral debate with fellow practitioners and collectively working towards wise action. 

Those virtue continuums will be presented at the 2nd workshop on 6th April 2017</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are expected to be used in medical schools and by doctors in their CPD to help them with ethical decision making for the benefit of their patients and the well being of the wider community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>37DA1CC8-C705-4753-A5A1-5D4BCE41CA67</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5b39aebff7.64724736</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/research/projects/2015/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on Medical Practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB923F6E-13A3-4568-A1CA-75FE0E5EF328</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many of the participants (medical students, junior doctors and experienced doctors) have reported that the interviews provided a space to reflect on their ethical decision making practice which they do not normally have chance to do.

The findings will eventually be presented back to wider groups of students and doctors to help them debate the best ways of making ethical decisions in different situations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c05eae824ae1.57237448</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/research/projects/2015/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>First workshop influence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E10044D0-9CFF-422F-99CC-E1ED3327F2AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Very early days but this first project workshop clearly stimulated much interest from all the above sectors.

Virtue (1985) contain very strong arguments of what we have lost in our understanding
of community and societal connections. That loss is of shared virtues which operate
through practice in service of wellbeing for all in society. In MacIntyre&amp;quot;s virtues-goodspractices-institution
schema (Moore and Beadle 2006) practice excellence offers rewards
for practitioners and citizens (internal goods), binds practitioners in one practice group
together, binds different practice groups together across institutional boundaries and
further still binds people across sectors in any given community. The theory
encompasses dynamic development of community connections by members who are
continually clarifying their personal aims by meshing with collective aims in a way that
serves the wellbeing of all in society. VE can be viewed as building on SF and social
learning theories to encompass the ethical connections between all practitioners in any
given society regardless of discipline. 

The way MacIntyre envisages the collective relationship of practices, the narrative of the
institution and their potential disruption is summarised by McCann and Brownsberger
(1990) who stress the centrality of telos (purpose) to human life. Disruption may involve
loss of a shared sense of telos and a corresponding lack of agreement concerning social
practices and the virtues that underpin them. For MacIntyre (1985) disruption and
corruption derive more often than not from an (individual or collective) bias in focus on
external goods (money, status and power) rather than on internal goods.
Workshop illustration: virtue as a mean
In order to apply the theoretical lens afforded by MacIntyre it becomes important to
understand the notion of virtue as a mean growing out of engagement with that practice,
not predefined. Any community needs rules or an ethos to hold it together: Aristotle in
Nichomachean Ethics (1958) suggests a set of virtue continuums (Courage, Generosity,
Magnificence, Pride, Anger, Truth and Indignation). MacIntyre was careful to avoid such
definitions, and we therefore allowed the accounts from our workshop practitioners to
define the virtues of connectedness in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Using a virtue continuum lens we
mapped stories of connected communities from our workshop participants (Figure 1 - see the URL).

Within the workshop we heard examples of practice which countered policy and practice
impositions perceived as potentially disruptive of communities by pre-defining the terms
of engagement: the focus was the incremental development of working relationships 
within and across communities, engaging with the learning in communities and seeking
to develop a common purpose. 

The virtue continuum model has been developed in the subsequent 'Phronesis and the Medical Community' award</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B44BA6B-693A-44C9-A1F1-C323CDE3D275</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar suggested that the model was helpful to participants in

The study will explore how doctors through their professional careers cultivate phronesis (practical wisdom) in the midst of navigating the complex world of healthcare in an era of markets and user choice. We are interested to see how they make context-dependent, localised and 'good' decisions for patients and the wider community. We will explore the role that phronesis plays in strengthening and sustaining trust between the medical community and wider health and social care community in which they practice. Given recent health and care scandals, a greater emphasis on (initial and continuing) education in appropriate ethics and values in the NHS is required.

Therefore a video series which animates the findings and which can be viewed by other researchers and used in educational settings will be produced to contribute to moving the debate along, and provide impact on medical education as rapidly as possible. We expect the video series to demonstrate a range of practices (identified through the research) and show maturing medical practitioners gaining a sense of what it means make good decisions despite the complexity of their roles and pressures they experience.

The specific aims of the study are threefold: first to explore the nature, transmission and enactment of phronesis by doctors through medical education and into practice; second to develop a *methodology that combines arts and humanities with social science to reliably understand and convey phronesis in the institutions that participate in the study; third to explore the role that phronesis plays in strengthening and sustaining bonds between the medical community and wider community.

The methodology developed (described in the methodology section) will be applicable to other sectors such as care, education, law and business and therefore the research promises much wider social and economic benefit.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5AEED8C6-E9FC-4C00-A385-BDC480178261</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our methodology and methods including the the virtue continuum model and arts based virtual community analysis have already been requested for replication in the US with the medical community by a senior academic in the field at Virginia University.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bb231b54b9.65686059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data handling and control systems that have applications outside of the original research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/news/2015/07/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In addition to the Virtue Continuum model reported on in my previous award we are using a virtual community arts based approach to the analysis of the data to animate the findings.

The analysis outputs include virtue continuum mapping and a video series plus other media to form a story line linked to an existing virtual community (Stilwell). The aim is to allow personalised ethical debate in medical schools, junior doctor peer groups or with experienced doctor peer groups to build phronesis that is relevant to the medical leadership and ethical decision making in their contexts and specialties.

To date little research has explored the ways in which phronesis is cultivated over a period of time within one professional community. Conroy et al (2012) did this for a health and social care community including the medical community but there is an absence of research with medical professionals to explore how they have accumulated and enacted phronesis within their daily practice. Questions have rarely been asked as to how professionals are equipped morally (or otherwise) to navigate a chaotic world of practice rife with competing demands and relationships. To date, many researchers within medicine (e.g. Kaldjian 2014, Montgomery 2006) have made the case for a reorientation towards phronesis in medical education, but little has been undertaken to explore what that might look like.

Existing studies have tended to capture practical wisdom within one snapshot, within one organisation or by following one practitioner. We propose that three communities of doctors over three time periods should be studied: beginning of formal medical study; on placement at the end of formal study; and established medical professionals with 5 years plus qualified experience. This design (Conroy et al 2015) will offer an opportunity to see how phronesis develops over time whilst enabling a varied discussion about how moral resources are accessed and what the role of formal education is in equipping practitioners for the messy realities and subjective realities of practice.

By exploring how doctors at different points in their careers have access to or draw upon moral resources, the study is interested to gather accounts about how they make 'good' decisions for the patient at hand; balancing care, compassion, quality, resources, capacity, medical outcomes and the wider well-being of the community. The artistic added element is that the participants will be involved in creatively shaping an original 'soap opera' style video series that will connect to an existing virtual community of health and social care practitioners, patients and the public (Stilwell 2016) 

The methodology proposed will hopefully be applicable to other sectors such as care, education, law and business and therefore the research promises much wider benefits. 
This entry has three main sections. First it begins with an explanation of how the methodology came about, the basic argument for the approach developed and then moves to explain the generic concept of Phronesis and the specific theories being used in the analysis phase of the approach. Second the argument for the use of a social construtionist, narrative approach and arts based virtual community findings presentation are then given further attention in the discussion section. Finally the methodology is described in detail and then the entry ends with conclusions that explain the potential contribution to the field and the potential implications for policy and practice as well as suggested further research.

Starting point
Conroy et al (2012) used MacIntyre's (1981) practice based community theory of virtue ethics including the virtue of Phronesis to present a mapping of virtue continuums for a health and social care community. The virtue continuums mapped were based on the stories told by the participants and showed where on the continuums each story was positioned hence the claimed Phronesis. What was clear from the last workshop with the community was how useful it was to the community to be able to see the virtue continuums presented and where the stories indicated decision points on the continuums. Their response to seeing this depiction of Phronesis was typically 'I realise now I need to move in x direction with y virtue continuum to make a better decision' (p9) In other words they were using the constructed picture of virtue continuums to help them improve their decision making based on their understanding of their own practice. This is very different to giving health and social care practitioners a set of ethical guidelines i.e. deontological principles to work to. Many writers on this subject e.g. Dawson (2010) have argued against the approach of using such ethical principles as they do not take into account the many different contextual variables of each ethical dilemma. 

Kotzee and Ignatowicz (2015) reveal the paucity of empirical studies designed to understand doctors' real ethical decision-making from a virtue perspective. Despite the emphasis placed on phronesis in the literature very few studies have explored to what extent doctors actually exhibit and use practical wisdom as part of their clinical decision-making process. However, without being able to understand the extent to which doctors do or do not possess phronesis, it is difficult to attempt to foster the growth of phronesis through education and training, or to provide advice on policy such that doctors feel more able to make those decisions that are practically wise within a setting that supports the phronetic process. 

What is missing from studies to date is a fully contextualised depiction of stories about decision making and how they relate to all the professionals involved. Dawson (2010) additionally argues against deontological guidelines arising from quantitative or qualitative based research that do not acknowledge the uncertainty in the research evidence. Conroy (2010) acknowledges this issue in qualitative studies using narrative accounts and argues for a social constructionist based narrative approach as an ethical way to approach leadership and virtue ethics research and change with practitioners. In other words stories told by practitioners to a researcher may or may not be accounts of what actually happened, however, they do offer a window into the socially constructed nature of ethics, intersubjective reality and decision making in the professional community they practice. The arts based development to the methodology described here offers an ethical approach to the research by constructing a video series that depicts a virtual medical community making decisions, again based on the stories as in Conroy et al (2012) but also themes and a serial with episodes as demonstrated in Conroy (2010) and Czarniawska (1997) that shows the characters developing in their Phronesis due to certain events and therefore for them, how and why particular decisions have been taken. This arts based addition to the presentation of findings is novel in that although the virtual community (Stilwell 2016) has been used before to help substitute for placements (Walshe 2009) and as a leadership development resource (Conroy and Corrie 2014) it has not been used for the specific purpose of showing the socially constructed virtues and Phronesis informed decision making. We argue that this methodological approach leads to a useful resource for doctors in pre-clinical undergraduate education and post clinical/graduate training as well as offering a CPD resource for experienced doctors. This innovation in the methodology means that research can bridge the gap (Smith 2016) between research and practice in an ethical way that could have a very positive impact on the medical community and impact positively on the public perception of that community.

What is Phronesis and why is important to ethical decision-making?
A rich tradition of thought studies the nature of ethical decision-making in medicine. Theories of ethical decision-making in medicine tend to focus on providing an answer for the question: What is the good or right decision to make about treatment, or intervention, etc.? Often the answer is formulated broadly using one of three distinct theoretical positions: consequentialism, deontology and virtue ethics. Very broadly, consequentialists understand the right or good decision as the one with the best consequences overall and, for deontologists, it is the decision that accords best with the principles of ethical medical practice. For virtue ethics, the good decision is the one flows from the good moral character of the individual (Aristotle 1985) or a practice based community (MacIntyre 1981) making the decision. 

Prominent medical virtue ethicists (e.g. Pellegrino and Thomasma, 1994; Oakley and Cocking, 2001; Montgomery, 2006; Kaldjian, 2010 and 2014; and Toon, 2014) argue that the virtue of phronesis in particular is crucial to good ethical decision-making in medicine. In Aristotle's system of ethics, the possession of virtues, such as being honest, does not in itself lead to a moral agent always doing the right thing. Firstly, it is common that even the best people - those who are, say, kind, honest, fair, serious-minded and so-on - do not always know what to do when faced with a difficult moral problems. For instance, when a doctor tells a person of their terminal illness for the first time, what does being honest really mean in practical terms? Telling them everything one knows about the illness and how it is likely to unfold? Telling them only some things? What is honest or not honest to say about the uncertainties that are no doubt involved? What can and should a doctor stay silent about while still being honest with the patient? Even the doctor who is very honest as a person needs to know, practically, how to be honest in a particular kind of situation. 

There are often situations in which a person's different virtues come into conflict. In an example like the one above, for instance, honesty and kindness can clearly come into conflict. Being honest demands that the doctor tell a person the full truth about their diagnosis; being kind, however, may demand that same doctor downplays the more unpleasant prospects or exaggerates a small chance of improvement in order to give the patient hope. How does the doctor who is both very honest and very kind know how to balance these two conflicting virtues when consulting with the patient? How does the doctor decide which virtue should weigh more strongly, and thus make the right decision about how to discuss the situation with the patient?. 

While virtues could mean people act from the right intentions, taking the action itself requires a form of practical moral know-how to determine the right course of action. Aristotle calls this form of know-how practical wisdom or phronesis (NE VI 1144b14-17). Phronesis fulfils two cardinal roles in virtue ethics. Firstly, it provides the practical know-how needed to turn virtue into successful action. Secondly, it enables the moral actor to weigh up the importance of the different virtues and competing goals that they themselves (or others) may have in any moral situation (Kristjansson, 2015) 

In this paper, we argue for a refined methodology whereby phronesis in medical practice can be studied and examined empirically, and an arts based representation of the empirical data used to reflect on and even change existing theory, policy and practice. 

By highlighting the importance of narrative in medicine, as well as in the social sciences more generally we will not only build the argument for our own proposed narrative approach to studying phronesis in medicine, but also show why studying phronesis empirically through the narrative lens is the most appropriate way to study the phenomenon of phronesis in the medical community. 


Phronesis, narrative and moral exemplars
Why is narrative suitable for the study of phronesis? We start by looking at some other social science methodologies and their limitations in this context then move to narrative. We outline the Grounded Theory (GT) approach as Option A, Ethnography as Option B, Hermeneutics as Option C and finally explore Option D the Narrative approach. We then discuss narrative, our chosen option, in more detail.

Option A - Grounded Theory
This research approach is used to develop conceptual categories and theory about social processes inductively from real-world observations from a selected group of people. The researcher may subsequently make further observations to test out the developed categories/theory. Glaser and Strauss (1967) developed the methods of GT whilst researching dying hospital patients (1965). The two originators diverged in their approach to GT in the 1980s and so we now have two sub-options. Glaser asserts a purist inductive approach to GT whereas Strauss admits a deductive element in the research process. Strauss (2002) offers that Grounded Theory is a theory about a conceptualized latent pattern, for example cultivating, credentializing, covering, client control and ritual loss ceremonies. 

GT has been subject to criticism, for example according to Charmaz (2002) 
 
'Grounded theory research might limit understanding because grounded theorists aim for analysis rather that the portrayal of subjects experience in it fullness ... fracturing the data imply that grounded theory methods lead to separating the experience from the experiencing subject, the meaning from the story, and the viewer from the viewed. Grounded theory limits entry into the subjects worlds and thus reduces understanding of their experience.' (p25)

Strauss argues that this kind of criticism is unfair since GT is not devoted to 'careful, full voice and meaning description' (2002: 26) of the participant's story. However, it is the participants story and meaning conveyed in the stories that we are interested in because the literature on phronesis (Paton et al 2016) points to this as an under researched area. We aim to gain better 'entry into the subjects worlds' and therefore increase understanding of their decision making world. 

GT is one means by which a set of qualitative factors or a theory can emerge and has a strict process to follow to establish that end. The GT approach produces a set of themes with quotes supporting the themes and would have been useful if we wanted to produce a set of qualitative factors or a theory of what contributes to good decision making - to get to some underlying pattern. This has been attempted to some extent by people like Hunter (2000) and more recently Francis (2013) who have both diagnosed the ills of the NHS including lack of local engagement, transparency, candour and not taking professional cultures into account. This is clearly part of the story but in order to understand from the perspective of doctors what it means to be making good decisions and appreciate more of the nature of his or her social reality we need to go beyond a set of themes to 'careful, full voice and meaning description' of the participant's story.

Theorists have also used GT and Structural Functional (SF) approaches to arrive at qualitative factors based on the analysis of data such as interview accounts and observations. SF has been criticised for not taking into account people's self-interest, maneuvering, manipulation and competition (Leach 1966) and that other factors such marriage and affinal ties have been neglected. Dawson (2003) has criticised this type of research for misdirecting attention towards best practice recipe guidelines that actually do little to improve practice.

According to Blackler et al (1999) the gap is in understanding the nature of support that would enable practitioners to cope with complexity and paradoxes. We now examine how a study might achieve that through an ethnographic approach similar to that employed by Blackler et al (1999) and Watson (1994 &amp;amp; 2003).

The perspective that narrative offers is that like the organisation in which decisions occur, phronesis is viewed as a polyphonic phenomenon (Boje 2000), a story of stories (Skoldberg 1994) or a set of themes within which narratives are introduced, developed, maintained, and stopped (Ford 1999). This perspective is evident in Czarniawska's (1997) study of Swedish government agencies in which she observes decision making about policy change consisting of a series of conversational episodes organised around particular themes (e.g. company-isation, decentralisation or computerisation) and directs the unfolding of sequential and concurrent conversations into a network of already existing conversations. The narrative approach builds on a growing body of studies (Czarniawska 1997; Gabriel 1995; Boje 2001; Shotter &amp;amp; Cunliffe 2002) - all of which emphasise the process of dialogical interaction as the never-ending construction of meaning and identity of the organisation and its participants. 

Of particular interest to this study is the way in which Czarniawska (1997) serialises the company-isation of the various departments in one local municipal administration. She describes a set of stories in the form of 'episodes' to illuminate a case study of decision making about transformation from public to private sector. Through the episodes the case is brought to life. We draw inspiration from Czarniawska's approach and build on her approach in a way that offers more in the way of the participants' stories rather than our account of what was happening and therefore, we hope, coming closer to the participants' social reality rather than ours. Czarniawska says that 'each story is a unique combination of random events, intentions, interests, intentions, and counter intentions and existing routines. The encounters described in the stories lead to a construction of meaning; actors interpret what is happening for themselves and for their audience. In other words, narratives are created and negotiated.' (1997: 79). Here we see strong parallels with Cunliffe's notion of 'Social Poetics' (2002) as this offers an enquiry method that harmonises ontologically with the narrative perspective on phronesis and offers the kind of alternative perspective that the literature on phronesis suggests is missing. We now explore what the Narrative approach means in terms of phronesis and examine some of the studies that we drew on initially to formulate the methodology.

One reason why narratives are crucial to any methodology to study phronesis is the integral part they play in socially constructing a subjective reality (Czarniawska 1997) and that they contribute to the 'meaning pool' (Sherman &amp;amp; Webb 1988.) of moral exemplars available (Zagzebski, 2013, 1). In addition, stories can be understood as a &amp;quot;model for human action and meaning&amp;quot; One way that storytelling influences human action is through the telling of stories about exemplars: people or groups of people who are defined as virtuous (Schultz and Flasher 2011) 

Czarniawska argues that there are &amp;quot;consequences of storytelling-for those who tell the stories and for those who study them&amp;quot; (2004, 41). In particular Somers and Gibson argue that stories guide actions as &amp;quot;people are guided to act in certain ways, and not others, on the basis of the projections, expectations, and memories derived from a multiplicity but ultimately linked repertoire of available social, public and cultural narratives&amp;quot; (1994, 38-39). As Reissman argues, &amp;quot;storytellers interpret the world and the experience in it: they sometimes create moral tales-how the world should be&amp;quot; (Riessman, 2005, 1). For Riessman if the storyteller is telling stories that are not suited to that community or derived from outside that community then they may be propagating the wrong exemplars and influencing incorrect or morally wrong action. 

Boje argues that storytelling occurs predominantly in conversations, which involve &amp;quot;listeners&amp;quot; (Boje, 1991, 107). In this methodology the interviewers assume the role of &amp;quot;listeners&amp;quot; by soliciting stories about virtuous or wise decision-making from the interviewees. Boje, like Lawler and others, also argues that stories are the &amp;quot;preferred sense-making currency&amp;quot; of human relationships, and are used to help decision-making by helping listeners to avoid &amp;quot;repeating historically bad choices&amp;quot; while inviting listeners to consider the value of &amp;quot;the repetition of past successes&amp;quot; (Boje, 1991, 106). If storytelling influences decision making, then it stands to reason that storytelling is a critical part of researching phronesis. In the next section we will outline how studying storytelling empirically can help us better understand the development of phronesis in doctors, and the role it plays in ethical decision-making. 

In medical ethics today, there is a growing trend towards studying ethical issues empirically. There is a growing realisation what role the social sciences can play in illuminating practice and informing theory in medical ethics, often referred to as 'empirical ethics' (Haimes, 2002) However, as we have seen above, only one previous empirical study (Little et al., 2011) has set out to study phronesis empirically in medicine and, while work on phronesis in nursing is more developed, most of the previous nursing studies have been of a small scale. All these studies have only used methodology and methods derived from the social sciences. Here we argue for a methodological approach that brings helpful aspects of social science together with arts based methods as a new wave in phronesis empirical research. We will now explain this hybrid approach.


A hybrid methodology for studying phronesis
In order to begin to understand phronesis in medical practice in a better way and to support doctors in cultivating phronesis in their education, training and practice we present here a refined methodology. 

It is based on the arguments above and has three distinct and ontologically compatible roots. From humanities, we draw on the virtue ethics philosophy of MacIntyre (1981) who argues that humans are story-telling animals and that our narratives carry meaning (Bruner 1990). From the social sciences Flyvbjerg et al.'s (2012) phronesis-based ethnography will support the contextualisation of the collected stories. From the arts we draw on a participatory video approach (Schugurensky 2005). 

 The aims of the approach are threefold: 

Firstly, to investigate if, or to what extent, phronesis is created, maintained and moulded over the educational and practice life of doctors in the UK and to discover which features, if any, characterise phronesis in medical practice. 

Secondly, to test out a methodology that combines the social sciences with arts and humanities in order to reliably understand and convey phronesis in those institutions that participate in the study. 

Finally, to examine how phronesis can be promoted through education and practice interventions in such a way that it strengthens and sustains the bonds between the medical community and the wider community, as well as improving patient care and patient experience. 

The study will attempt to answer the following primary and secondary research questions.

Primary research questions:

1. What does phronesis (pratical wisdom) mean to medical students and practitioners?
2. To what extent is phronesis cultivated, maintained and moulded over the educational and practice life of doctors in the UK?
3. To what extent can phronesis be promoted through educational and practice interventions?

Secondary questions:

a. What does an empirical study of phronesis within the medical context tell us about theoretical debates in virtue ethics?
b. Do understandings and enactments of phronesis change through medical education, and if yes how? 
c. How much room do doctors in the UK have for exhibiting phronesis in their professional practice?
d. Does phronesis play a role in sustaining the community's trust in the medical profession?
e. Are there enabling factors (e.g. presence of role models) and/or competing forces (e.g. marketization or bureaucratization) that influence the extent to which doctors can exhibit phronesis in professional practice? 


As we have seen above, an overall narrative approach to the nature of virtue (including phronesis) is crucial to this project. In order to answer questions 1 and 2, we will seek to collect narratives of phronesis in action from medical students and doctors as well as narratives of the development of phronesis. We will collect these narratives by conducting interviews, by observing medical students and doctors at work and by asking some of them to keep a narrative diary. We will approach question 3 by involving the medical community in the co-production of a video series that uses dramatized stories to illustrate phronesis and its development in the medical context. In keeping with the narrative approach it will be our contention that phronesis can also be best communicated and developed through narratives. For this part of the project, we will use a similar approach to that used by the Stillwell Multi-Media Virtual Community (Stilwell 2016) developed by the University of Cumbria. 

Methodological approach in detail
The methods are designed to collect narratives, diaries and observations about phronesis from medical students and doctors at various stages of their careers in the United Kingdom.

Three main forms of data collection will be used in the first phase of the study: diary notes, interviews with participants in the four cohorts and ethnographic observations of the longitudinal F1 and F2 cohort. Interviews will be semi-structured and will be developed from (1) Conroy's story gathering methods (Conroy et al 2012) and (2) Kotzee's methods from the Virtues and Values in Medicine project (Kotzee et al 2014). Observations will use an overt non-participant approach and all field notes will be taken as unobtrusively as possible, according to a proforma. Study participants will be asked to keep diary notes of important incidents and bring them to the interviews. All interview, observation and diary notes will be entered into NVivo10. 

Semi-structured interviews lasting roughly 45 minutes with each participant from all four cohorts will be used as the primary form of data collection in the study. The interviews will be lightly-structured at first and will start by explaining that we are interested in exploring the participant's experience of the nature, transmission and enactment of practical wisdom. Participants will be allowed to start discussion of the topic wherever and however they want. If they do not respond to this then the interviewer might say 'It seems hard for you to start on this subject, would you like to start with the difficulty?' We would then ask them about instances or stories that they allude to in the difficulty. If the interviewer presents facts or offers general accounts they will be invited to give specific examples relating to their account. Experience from previous studies (Conroy 2010 &amp;amp; Conroy et al 2012) show that for most interviews explanation of the research aims and active listening signals are an excellent means of generating stories. The research questions below (framed in relation to their accounts) will inform the structure for the second part of the interview to gain clarification of context, the characters involved, dilemmas, competing pressures, community response, etc. Participants will be asked to recount stories of the following sorts:

? where they feel they have applied their own practical wisdom to a work situation. 
? where they feel they could have acted more wisely
? where they have seen a colleague making a particularly wise decision
? where they have seen a colleague making a particularly unwise decision
? whether they know of any particularly wise or unwise decisions that they have not experienced directly, but that have influenced them in their thinking
? what they think the characteristics are of wise or unwise decisions in medicine.

Observations
Observations of individual participants from the four cohorts will also be undertaken during the fieldwork. One of the fundamental theoretical strains that runs through the research is the importance of storytelling in phronetic education. Stories are often used like precedent cases, or exemplars, and are highly valuable for helping the storyteller and/or the listener to make decisions (Boje, 1991; Zagzebski, 2013). Only by observing storytelling within the clinical or educational context can we as researchers understand the role stories and narrative play, or if they play a role, in the development and use of phronesis in the medical context. As storytelling occurs predominantly in conversations which involve 'listeners' (Boje, 1991), observations of these conversations will allow the researcher to become one of the 'listeners' and thus be part of the story performance. As a listening observer the researchers will see first-hand the kind of interactions that are occurring on a day-to-day basis that may influence how participants understand and use phronesis to make decisions. Observing participants will also provide context to the participants' development of phronesis (if it occurs), as well as their interviews and diaries, which will be important when developing the video series. 

A selection of Foundation Year doctors and experienced practitioners will be observed in the multidisciplinary team meetings that many will attend on a weekly basis. Consent will be sought from all attending team members and the observer will be bound by the same patient confidentiality clauses as the doctors. We 2aim to observe 5-10 participants from each cohort during fieldwork. Observing these two cohorts in these meetings will allow the researchers to observe how the participants make decisions and contribute to the decision-making of their colleagues. Multidisciplinary team meetings are specific meetings that set time aside for the various colleagues in certain fields, for example cancer, to discuss the treatment options and non-treatment options they feel are available to the patient. Decisions are often made in these meetings about which treatments to offer (or not offer) and the possibility of patient eligibility for research participation. As a result a concentrated number of ethical decisions are debated and made in this meeting, and our research into how and why these decisions are made would benefit greatly from the observation of these meetings. Experienced practitioners who are GPs may also be observed in their GP practice, but not during their interactions with patients.

Participant Kept Diaries
Participant kept diaries are another form of narrative and storytelling that we would like to capture in the study. These diaries provide accounts close in time to events, as well as a &amp;quot;record of an ever-changing present&amp;quot; (Brennan et al, 2010). They are self-reflexive and can be used by the diarist to provide context for decisions the diarist makes, or decisions they see others making in practice. The diaries are also a retelling of a story, and so are a form of story performance to a specific audience (Boje, 1991) that offers another perspective on the participants' individual experiences with phronetic education and 'wise' decision-making. 

Ten participants in total from the entire F1/F2 cohort (i.e. Birmingham. Nottingham and Warwick) will be asked to keep an audio diary, attempting to make a short (5-10 min) audio entry for every working week that they are part of the study. Asking the longitudinal cohort to keep a diary will help track their phronetic education and decision-making over time (Elliott, 1997). The diarists will then be asked to return these recordings to the researchers before their final interview, so that the researchers have the opportunity to review the entries and in the final interview develop their understanding of the meanings the diarists attribute to their experiences (Elliott, 1997). 
 
Analysis
The social science-based analysis will be used as a way to reveal themes and extract stories and a serial for the arts-based analysis. The thematic (social science) analysis element will use a Framework Approach (Ritchie et al 2010) to yield themes or categories of what doctors find important, typologies of people and events and explanations of medical workers' behaviour. Coding will be conducted in NVivo 10; theoretical, a priori codes will be used to start the analysis, with further codes being developed from the data through both horizontal and vertical coding. The arts based analysis element follows the precedent set by Czarniawska (1997) and will initially focus on the localised stories, themes and a serial of developmental episodes. Second, 'poetic story modes' following Gabriel (2000), will be used to categorise the stories into different types of plot (epic, tragic, comic and romantic) as originally discerned in Aristotle's Poetics. The end goal will be the development of a number of themes each of which relate to the stories and a serial that can be used as the basis of the video series and the theoretical analysis.

The nature of phronesis will be examined through two theoretical lenses: MacIntyre's (1981) virtue ethics and Kaldjian's (2010) medical phronesis. Virtue ethics provides a virtues-goods-practices-institution schema (Moore and Beadle 2006) which comprises a number of theoretical concepts relating to phronesis: 
? Virtues: disposition to act in a certain way that enables us to achieve internal goods (includes wisdom) 
? Internal goods: the excellence of products/services and the perfection of the individual in the process. 
? External goods: only contingently attached to a practice e.g. money, status and power
? Practice: any coherent and complex form of social activity e.g. medicine, nursing, social work etc.
? Institutions: primarily concerned with producing and distributing external goods Narrative quest: search for our purpose (telos) toward wellbeing (eudaimonia)
? Communal narrative quest: arising from a meshing of practice virtues and a telos of collective wellbeing The Medical Phronesis lens held alongside virtue ethics will help us to contextualise the notion of phronesis. 

According to Kaldjian (2010: 559), phronesis in the context of medicine encompasses:
? Pursuit of worthwhile ends
? Accurate perception of concrete circumstances 
? Commitment to moral principles and virtues 
? Deliberation that integrates ends, concrete circumstances and moral principles or virtues
? Motivation to act in order to achieve the conclusions reached by such deliberation.

An initial output of the analyses will be a virtue continuum mapping as described in Conroy et al (2012) to illustrate phronesis enactment. The next stage will be virtual community media production. The media will include a video series, blogs, social media, newspaper pages etc. The process of moving from data and analysis to the video series will be a co-production between the creative director , the research team, participant representatives and a Stilwell representative. A series of workshops will be convened to map out the story boards and characters for the video serial and to link to characters within the wider Stilwell virtual community (http://www.stilwelleducation.com) Once the story boards are agreed the creative director will write a script for each video episode based on the findings. The scripts will be reviewed by cohort representatives, the researchers and medical educators from each of the partnering institutions. A theme and/or ethical dilemma will provide a focus for each episode which will relate to a session within a series of blocks in a medical training programme module. As illustration, a first theme might be 'From Pillar to Post' showing the competing pressures as described above and the potential for impressionable and unstable positions taken by a fledgling doctor. Second might be 'A Purposeful Stand' showing a doctor gaining clarity of purpose and deciding where they stand in relation to the competing pressures, ideologies and practical dilemmas. Third might be 'Maintaining an Ethical Stance' showing how that stance plays out in a number of different interactions with other doctors, nursing staff, patients, family, social services etc. and how in practice that stance might not always produce the desired outcomes for patients. These examples show that many different themes and storylines can be explored in a serial format with the same characters to enable medical student reflection and debate on the concept and practice of phronesis. Once the scripts are agreed the film production team, who are well versed in Stilwell productions, will co-produce the videos using professional actors and advice from cohort representatives and the researchers. 

Conclusion

The methodology described here will provide an artistic presentation of the issues of phronesis in a medical community of any practice based community. The video series 'soap opera' and the way it links to the existing virtual community will be debated with a broad audience of academics, practitioners, patients and policy makers and others with an interest in the field at workshops. 

The video series will offer an innovative, edgy complement to the many text based recommendations that have emanated from scandal enquiry reports and social science based studies to date. New understandings of the cultivation of phronesis in medical communities and its role in rebuilding public trust in the light of many scandals will be of interest to healthcare researchers, educators, practitioners and policymakers. The aim is to impact on the medical and professional education of doctors as a community, building stronger links between the medical community and the public and rebuilding public confidence in the medical profession.

MacIntyre (1981, 2009) argues that moral debating resources are missing from ethical education and the wider theological and philosophical context of any practice. We argue here that the methodological approach and the resultant outputs offer the education and training of doctors a moral debating resource in the form of virtue continuum mapping and the added resource of a video series plus other media to form a virtual community presentation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6B17EFFB-129C-437C-88B1-2C61D8C02950</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A great deal of interest has been shown in the methodology and the PI, Dr Mervyn Conroy, has been approached by academics from the UK and the US who have asked him to share the methodology so they can replicate the study with medics and nurse in healthcare institutions connected to their universities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0647b3d8753.22568682</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Novel hybrid research methodology to study phronesis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/social-policy/departments/health-services-management-centre/research/projects/2015/phronesis-and-the-medical-community.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Covered in previous entry as an artistic product and I have no idea whether this would also be considered a Technical product.
