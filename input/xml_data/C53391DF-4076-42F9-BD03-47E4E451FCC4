The appetite for these books proved insatiable, promising commercial success to publishers at a time when many of them were experiencing severe economic difficulties. Before long, Italian writers began turning their hand to crime fiction in the hope of sharing in this lucrative market. Their books laid the foundations for a narrative form that would turn out to be immensely influential in Italy, both in popular culture (stories in magazines, novels, films and comics) and in the literature of 'highbrow' writers (novels by respected intellectuals such as Carlo Emilio Gadda, Leonardo Sciascia and Umberto Eco). \n\nThis project explores the publishing phenomenon of crime fiction under Fascism from an historical and cultural perspective. It offers an in-depth analysis of a number of Italian detective novels, examined for the first time in relation to the Italian translations of Anglo-American detective novels that circulated during the same period. Through what is an innovative approach it seeks to assess the impact that foreign detective novels had in generating a 'language of translation' for Italian writers to draw on whilst trying to forge a new narrative idiom of their own. Close readings of a representative sample of these texts are informed by a careful reconstruction of the contexts of production, including an examination of the interaction between publishers and censors, of the regime's cultural policies and of the literary establishment's attitudes towards detective novels. My work seeks, therefore, to be not only wide-ranging but also to be firmly grounded in evidence-based history, in this way superseding previous studies and also making good some of their deficiencies. \n\nThe resulting publication will be the first book-length study (whether in English or Italian) of crime fiction in interwar Italy. It will consist of six chapters. Chapter 1 covers the publishing history of the genre in Italy from the first sporadic translations during the nineteenth century until the commercial success achieved by detective novels in the 1930s. Chapter 2 discusses the remarkably modern marketing strategies devised by Mondadori in its bid to capture a new readership. Chapter 3 discusses the polarisation of popular and critical responses to the genre, with the hostility of the Fascist regime seen as a function of its nationalising agenda and protectionist policies, and the opposition of the critics as a more general rejection of mass culture. Chapter 4 analyses the earliest Italian detective novels, assessing the influence of the foreign models they competed with. Chapter 5 focuses on the most accomplished of these writers, discussing their attempts to 'italianise' crime fiction, while Chapter 6 explores the reasons for the choice of America as a setting in the work of two Italian crime writers of the period. \n\nMy research will contribute to a burgeoning field within the European context. Based on archival work and textual analysis, it will be disseminated through papers as well as a book. As a pioneering project, it will highlight the vitality of Italian detective novels, often capable of responding creatively to foreign, especially American, literary influences in a process of transculturation that has hitherto been ignored by critics. The published book will make available to a wide audience much material that is inaccessible, and in so doing will open up an exciting new area of investigation for scholars working in Italian Studies, Comparative Literature, Cultural Studies and Translation Studies. It will also appeal more generally to those interested in literary production and consumption, Fascist censorship and crime fiction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H005366/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
