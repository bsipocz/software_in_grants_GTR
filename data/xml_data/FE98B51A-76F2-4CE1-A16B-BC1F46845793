This might be control of electrical current in the case of semiconductors, magnetism for data storage, the Peltier effect for solid-state refrigerators, or superconductivity for ultra high power magnets used in MRI scanners. Underpinning future refinements of such &amp;quot;functional materials&amp;quot; and development of new materials and devices lies the idea of &amp;quot;materials design&amp;quot;. Computer simulation methods with the power to predict the active properties based only on the quantum-mechanical behaviour of the electrons in a particular crystal structure are a vital part of any attempt to engineer &amp;quot;designer materials&amp;quot; for future devices.

The proposers of this grant are among those responsible for writing the CASTEP density-functional theory (DFT) modelling code, which is among the top few modelling codes used on the previous generation HECToR national high-performance computing service. CASTEP is licensed to nearly 100 UK research groups, was used to generate 118 research publications in 2013 and a worldwide total exceeding 4000.

Density-functional theory is the simulation method of choice for a large part of modern materials science, condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry. It can treat a huge range of materials, including bulk metals, oxides, semiconductors, layered materials such as graphene, surfaces and much more. It is widely used to predict structural and energetic properties such as phase transitions, electronic transport properties, spectroscopic properties including NMR chemical shifts, inelastic neutron and X-Ray, Raman and infrared, XANES and other near-edge electronic spectra.

However, its success is not universal. The essential approximations to exchange and correlation (ie the LDA, GGAs and hybrids) have poor predictive power for many materials containing open d- and f-shells, frequently described as &amp;quot;strongly-correlated&amp;quot;. For example many transition-metal oxides are erroneously predicted by LDA and GGA to be metallic, Jahn-Teller structural distortions are absent and phase transitions involving electron delocalisation are not reproduced.

Methods for treating strongly-correlated systems which remedy the deficiencies of semi-local DFT include dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the so-called GW approximation. However these are currently not readily accessible to the materials modelling community, partly because of computational expense and partly because of the lack of robust, easily deployable modelling codes.

Herein we propose to implement both LDA+DMFT and GW within CASTEP, the UK's premier electronic structure-based materials modelling code. Our strategic target is to substantially broaden the strong-correlation modelling community in the UK, which is currently small compared to either France or Germany. The planned deliverables will offer both an extension to CASTEP with end-user capability, but also a software platform for further development of the methodology. A key feature of our DMFT implementation will be the availability of forces, and capability of structure optimization. This will enable a realistic treatment of complex materials with low site symmetry. We hope this will stimulate an growth in the adoption of these methods in the UK from the developer groups to a wider modelling community much as happened with DFT.

The power of simulation works best when used hand in hand with experimental studies. The UK has invested heavily in instruments targeted at &amp;quot;strongly-correlated&amp;quot; materials in the RIXS and ARPES beamlines at Diamond Light Source and the MERLIN instruments at ISIS target station 2 neutron facility. A key feature of this proposal is to work with scientists at both facilities to deliver the capability of modelling some of the actual materials selected for experimental study by the scientific user community. We believe this will maximise the impact of the work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The economic and societal impacts will derive from the understanding of the physical properties of correlated materials, and from state-of-the-art computational tools that will enhance our ability to explore the properties of these materials. The knowledge outcomes and the tools developed in this project will help researchers in academia and industry to identify and design novel compounds with improved properties and functionalities. Nowadays, first-principles codes are powerful enablers of materials understanding, prediction and design, and their capabilities and potential for impact is demonstrated, for instance, by programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative in the US [1] or by the European Commission [2]. Density functional theory (DFT) codes are also widely used in electronic and manufacturing industries [2-3]. 

A general problem with DFT however is that it fails at describing a large class of materials where strong electronic correlations are important, such as transition metal materials or lanthanides. 
Its range of application is hence limited, and extensions of DFT are called for. Transition metal oxides are in particular interesting for industrial applications. Copper oxides are high temperature superconductors, and have opened new possibilities in a range of technological applications: i) they are used in medical resonance imaging scanners, in medical institutions, ii) for magnetic levitation to reduce friction in trains (MagLev in Japan), iii) to transport electric current without any resistance, iv) or for high sensitivity magnetic detectors. Vanadates are used to design &amp;quot;intelligent windows&amp;quot; which block the heat dissipation when the external temperature cools down at night. 

The knowledge outcomes and the tools developed in this project will enable scientists working in research institutions and industry to explain why strongly correlated novel materials behave as they do, and make it possible to identify and even design novel materials for potential technological applications as novel magnets, thermo-electrics, topological insulators, and superconductors, all of very high importance for both societal and commercial impact. 

The project will advance the power and reach of new emerging techniques for strongly correlated materials, such as the DFT+DMFT and DFT+GW, and in particular provide integrated tool suite (in the widely distributed CASTEP code) to non-computational experts, such that they can make predictions to guide experiments. This proposal will provide a solid theoretical background and computational tools for interpreting experimental spectra. This will be a particular advantage for our Project Partners at the UK's Diamond Light Source, where new instruments and a new beamline are currently under construction, and the ISIS facility. 

CASTEP is distributed under a mixed model of a free of charge license to UK academic groups in partnership with Accelrys Inc. The strong-correlation capabilities developed by this project will be distributed under same arrangements. Accelrys (now part of Dassault Systems 3DS) plays a key role in enabling the use of technical scientific software within commercial organisations by providing a simple to use graphical user interface, as well as training and support in using the software. Commercial CASTEP customers include many well known UK and global corporations who use materials modelling in their R&amp;amp;D. The expansion in functionality provided by the proposed developments will open up new industry sectors (e.g. in magnetic materials, semiconductor devices, spintronics). Further details are provided in the attached statement of support from Accelrys.
