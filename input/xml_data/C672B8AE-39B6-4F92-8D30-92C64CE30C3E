Since then nitric oxide has been found to play a wide variety of important roles in other types of tissue including the brain where it regulates nerve cell development, as well as numerous brain functions like learning and memory. How nitric oxide is able to participate in regulating electrical activity in virtually every region of the brain is still a bit of a mystery. However, we know that certain nerve cells can make and release nitric oxide which then controls the ability of other nerve cells to communicate with each other. One of the reasons why it has been difficult to make progress in because the brain of adult animals, especially mammals is extremely complex and nitric oxide can be produced simultaneously, not just by many different nerve cells but also by the myriad of blood vessels that ramify throughout the brain. The aspect of brain function that we have selected to study in order to gain insights into the basics of nitric oxide biology is the control of movement, particularly the neural networks of the spinal cord that control locomotion and how these networks are controlled by the brainstem. We study the far simpler networks located in the central nervous system of young frog tadpoles which are assembled to regulate swimming movements. Our previous work in this area characterized nerve cells that can manufacture nitric oxide and these are located exclusively in the brainstem. In this project we wish to understand more about these nerve cells and characterize what other neurotransmitters they are able to make and release. The nitric oxide nerve cells belong to specific clusters which project to the spinal cord so it will be important to understand their activity during swimming and how they interact with each other in the presence or absence of nitric oxide. The nitric oxide produced in the brainstem acts on nerve cells of the spinal cord that generate movement, called motorneurons. Nitric oxide changes the electrical activity of motorneurons and hence how they respond to signals that tell the tadpole to swim, but how does nitric oxide achieve this 'modulation' of motorneurons and rhythmic movements for swimming? The advantages of studying nitric oxide signalling in the brain and spinal cord of this simple model system are numerous. Importantly the neural circuits that regulate locomotion bear many similarities to those of adult vertebrates, including mammals because they all derive from a common ancestry and are therefore built on a similar plan. In addition, the relative simplicity of the networks at early stages of development mean that nitric oxide effects can be studied at the level of single cells and understood in relation to the behaviour being regulated. From an ethical perspective it is advantageous to be able to study mechanisms of nitric oxide function that are highly conserved in an organism that does not possess the brain power to detect pain in the way that adult mammals like mice and cats do, if at all. Finally, the nitric oxide system is one of tremendous therapeutic importance and therefore our work may yield important clues as to how the system can be manipulated to the benefit of mankind in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim is to understand, on multiple levels, the modulation by nitric oxide (NO) of spinal cord and brainstem locomotor networks, from cells and synapses to network interactions and behaviour. We will utilize Xenopus frog tadpoles as a simple and accessible system where the swimming network, sources of NO and some NO mechanisms have already been characterized. We will describe how NO modulates the electrical properties of spinal neurons and synaptic interactions between them. Experiments will seek to understand the ion channels and conductances which enable NO to depolarize spinal motorneurons and increase their input resistance. At the level of synaptic connections in the locomotor network we will follow up on preliminary data indicating presynaptic inhibition of excitatory transmission by NO. Using anatomical techniques we will identify NO targets in the spinal cord and image how these appear during development. We aim to identify the co-transmitters of brainstem nitrergic neuron clusters and attempt to link NOS activity to locomotor activity using the DAF-2DA fluorescence method as a monitor of NO generation in brainstem neurons. This method, for which we have obtained 'proof of concept' for NO production in Xenopus skin cells, could also be invaluable in studies of brainstem NOS positive neurons, by facilitating visually-guided patch recordings. Patch clamp recordings from brainstem nitrergic neurons will be performed to characterize their activity patterns and describe how they respond to NO. To bring together these various strands of the project we will develop ideas relating to NO's role as a 'metamodulator' by testing the hypothesis that serotonergic and noradrenergic systems of the brainstem are mutually inhibitory and that NO alters the balance between them to influence subordinate spinal locomotor circuitry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>359868</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Model Organism (St Andrews)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DC97270A-2978-44E6-A68B-2270E174114A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using excess to requirement material, a tank of living Xenopus laevis tadpoles in the process of metamorphosis was on display in the Bute Medical Building.

In addition, I supply tadpoles and adults to other users such as Universities and Industry. I use excess to requirement tadpoles generated from my research breeding colony of in the amphibian Xenopus laevis in St Andrews. Isobel Maynard is employed 0.5 time to develop the project, occasionally assisted by undergraduate neuroscience students in my lab. 

We have established many connections with Schools across Scotland. Highlighted examples so far include Thornton Primary School which was provided with a tank of Xenopus tadpoles for their science class. I attended the School and gave a talk followed by a question and answer session to teh entire School of &amp;gt;100 students from Primary 1 to Primary 7, as well as the teaching staff. As a result of their tadpole development project the School won a Scottish national award on delivery of STEM subjects at School level. 

A second highlight has been the success of our interactions with Kinloch Rannoch Primary School near Pitlochry. The School was provided with 4 tanks of Xenopus tadpoles allowing the children to observe their development. The project appears on the school website which proudly displays &amp;quot;Toad TV&amp;quot; on its front page, with links to photographs and videos:

Each successful pairing results in a surplus of fertile ova which provided a good source of material which during and subsequent to the end of this grant have been used in a variety of Public Engagement events. These are aimed at education of children and the general public in topics such as animal development, hormone control, sexual reproduction and behaviour, in particular using the amazing transformations that accompany frog metamorphosis. 

For the duration of grant the PI was one of a small team in the School of Biology dealing with Open Days for prospective undergraduate students and their parents. These events numbered up to 12 per year and involved an introductory lecture on Biology at St Andrews followed by zoology museum and laboratory visits. For the latter the PI presented BBSRC funded research on Xenopus frog tadpoles, including demonstrations with live exhibits and involving BBSRC funded PhD student Mr Stephen Currie.

More recently, what began under the auspices of this grant, has blossomed in a series of projects with growing impact, initial support for which was obtained from the Wellcome Trust ISSF grant awarded to St Andrews. We now provide &amp;quot;Grow-a-Frog&amp;quot; kits with additional educational material to a number of Local and National Schools at all levels. We have also recently embarked on a similar outreach project with the Prison Service including a Young Offenders Institution with around 500 male inmates. In addition to the educational benefits we provide, it is also anticipated that the young offenders, aged between 16 and 23, will benefit from the opportunity to care for the animals and nurture them through metamorphosis. We (including the Prison staff) are hopeful that this enterprise will have a major impact on the lives of young and often disadvantaged individuals and that our outreach activities will facilitate their re-entry into society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>178987BA-BF4F-4A23-B908-94BF71B6294F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d70a5a994886.74826458</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall objectives of the grant were to explore mechanisms through which the nitric oxide (NO) signalling system exerts a &amp;quot;metamodulatory&amp;quot; control of spinal motor control networks and these objectives were met. The research focussed on the Xenopus tadpole model system in which data had been obtained to support an important role for NO in modulation. 
The grant also led to further projects and funding. Most of the experiments were carried out by the postdoctoral assistant Dr HongYan Zhang (now Chancellor's Fellow and PI at the University of Edinburgh); some were carried in collaboration Professor Mel Robertson who visited the lab on sabbatical from Queen's University in Kingston Canada and research on NO modulation during development was done in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Bordeaux. In addition to meeting the main aims, novel and unexpected data relating to NO's role emerged during the course of the project.
Effects of NO on spinal neurons and network output
We had reported a range of NO effects on unidentified spinal neurons but these earlier data derived from (poor) sharp electrode recordings. We therefore applied much better whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to spinal neurons which enabled us to identify the neurons after the experiment. As a result we were able to build up a catalogue of NO effects on identified neuron classes. This area of investigation proved to be very productive and occupied relatively more of the grant period than was originally anticipated and we documented a wide range of effects, not listed here in detail. Our data also revealed that the spinal motor system develops very rapidly in the first day of life and our combined anatomical and functional data allowed us to describe how flexibility in motor output emerges following the differentiation of motorneuron properties and their peripheral innervation fields. This led to a high profile paper in PNAS. 

A serendipitous finding from NO donor applications was their ability to block a long duration (~60 second), slow hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in certain spinal neurons at the end of a bout of locomotion. We explored this unexplained cellular phenomenon (which we termed the usAHP) in more detail and discovered it was due to the activity-dependent upregulation of the Na+/K+ pump. The usAHP profoundly influences subsequent episodes of locomotion and so links future to past activity. We published these initial findings of a novel form of short term spinal motor memory in Current Biology in 2011; a follow up paper describing the underlying mechanism (involving de-inactivation of an A-type K+ current) was published in 2015 in Scientific Reports. As a direct result of the original finding I embarked on collaborations to seek novel roles for the Na+/K+ pump in other motor systems including the neonatal mouse. The fact that this short-term memory is regulated by the NO pathway provided the impetus for an entirely new view brain circuit regulation.

One of the effects of increased NO on the motor system is to inhibit rhythm generation. In collaboration with Mel Robertson, a visiting Professor from Canada whose interests lie in the response of the brain to abiotic stressors, we showed that once temperature reaches a critical threshold there is an initial activation of escape behaviour followed by an adaptive shut-down of locomotor activity. The temperature threshold is set by the NO/cGMP system. We concluded that rises in temperature increase the activity of NOS, the synthetic enzyme for NO production, and the resulting increase in NO levels inhibits swimming, in part by enhancing GABA signalling. 

The outcomes led to several future research directions that have/are being pursued in collaboration with others. In our Xenopus research, two BBSRC students continued the work: Stephen Currie (now a postdoc in Edinburgh) pursued later stages of Xenopus development and discovered a role for NO and the usAHP; Laurence Picton's BBSRC EastBio funded research explored modulation of the usAHP and discovered a novel role for dopamine which, in contrast to NO, enhances pump function. Laurence also participated in a collaboration with Gareth Miles' lab in St Andrews on the possible contribution of the Na+/K+ pump to network plasticity in mouse spinal cord. A paper on this topic has been prepared for submission. Laurence is also an author on a major new textbook (Sillar, Picton and Heitler) as a result of the 3 month internship as part of his PhD. This book, reported in his ResearchFish entry, will be available for purchase in April 2016. Finally, Picton is currently a postdoc in my lab on a Carnegie Trust funded project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research led to increased knowledge of the fundamental organization of spinal cord networks, how they develop and how their output is controlled. The emphasis was on how spinal circuits in the relatively simple spinal cord of frog tadpoles are influenced by the neuromodulator, nitric oxide. This knowledge has and will be been used to explore nitric oxide modulation in other more complex and less accessible neuronal networks, for example in animals. Nitric oxide related drugs are of interest to the the pharmaceutical sector and our data have the potential to illuminate new drug targets.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B088909D-51CE-41B6-9D5E-6627D9F8E3FD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8049f81e3a7.52683028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and
