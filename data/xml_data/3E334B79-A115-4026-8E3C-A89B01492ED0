Communication and trust issues are routinely cited as the most important aspects of project success, thus it can be hypothesised that an important reason for failure may be the complexity that arises from social interactions within project environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research intends to investigate the propagation of commitment and trust through the social networks in software implementations. In particular, an aim is to understand the role that trust (or lack of) between project team members plays in the successful completion of large software implementation projects, involving multiple vendors distributed over multiple geographies and time zones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with professional project managers from IT consulting firms. The data will be analysed using both qualitative and computational modelling approaches, including the generation of a network map of social relationships, to test the propagation of commitment and trust along the network. It is envisaged that experimentation on the network map will provide insight into the robustness and fragility of social interactions within large software implementations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is expected to benefit individuals and organisations (both academic and commercial) interested in the field of project management and the use of computer simulations to answer real-world problems. In particular, the research is expected to contribute to the development of new project lifecycle and project management methodologies for those managing large software implementations, which manifest the behaviours of complexity. 

We believe that these individuals and groups will benefit in the following ways:

1) Fostering a more efficient approach to managing projects that exhibit complexity. Due to the UK rapidly becoming a knowledge-based service economy, from it's historical roots as a manufacturing economy, we believe the efficient management and implementation of projects, in particular within the public sector, is of paramount importance to a healthy UK plc.
2) Recognising, understanding and managing the impact that commitment and trust from project team members has on successful implementation of projects. The Standish Chaos Report 2009 advises that the majority of IT projects are implemented over both time and budget. We believe the 'human' element, is a major reason for this, and hypothesise that communication issues, lack of trust between vendor and customer resources, and lack of commitment (by resources) to the project may be to blame.
3) Recognising, understanding and managing the impact that multi-vendor dynamics and multiple geographies have on the development of commitment and trust from project resources
4) Increasing the effectiveness of project management within both public sector and commercial organisations
5) It is envisaged that initial benefits occuring during the lifetime of the research, will mainly be targeted towards the academic sector. Following completion of the research however, it is expected that the wider project management community will benefit through dissemination of our findings at conferences and through the British Computer Society and Project Management Institute.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This research investigated the business-to-business relations within large multi-vendor software implementations, and more specifically the development of distrust and conflict within (intragroup) and between (intergroup) project teams. It is still relatively early for non-academic impact, however the findings are beginning to be used by information systems service providers to understand how they can better manage group dynamics to mitigate the development and propagation of distrust within large information system programmes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0807253D-B727-4493-A925-AB70F3F7ED37</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543fa216842470.16121631</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As the Management and Business Development Fellowship (MBDF) was a junior training fellowship intended to facilitate the career-change of experienced professionals from industry into the world of academia, perhaps the most important achievement of the fellowship is that I have been offered an indefinite lectureship (subject to passing probationary criteria) at Lancaster University Management School. Although I have encountered a number of obstacles to completing the full scope of the research component of the MBDF (discussed later in this report), I have gained knowledge and experience of the other two aspects (teaching and service) that are involved in an academic career. Additionally, I have successfully completed the Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice (PGCAP) and been awarded Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

In relation to the research, this junior fellowship has generated data that will facilitate significant new knowledge around the area of managing complex software implementations. For example, along with the qualitative data that was generated through semi-structured interviews, the research also generated data that has allowed the development of a 'typical' social network that may form within large multi-vendor ERP implementations. Along with the usual nodes (actors) and edges (interactions), this dataset provides a number of categorisation variables, which are amenable to modelling using computational approaches.

Important new research questions can therefore be opened up following the development of an agent-based model of the social network. This model will then facilitate the use of computational experimentation in a predictive capacity, so that we may develop hypotheses of how the propagation of conflict and distrust may affect the likelihood of success or failure of the ERP implementation. Additionally, this future computational experimentation, which falls under the broader research area of computational social sciences, may be complemented by knowledge from other disciplines, such as the life sciences, and in particular biochemistry. For instance there are a number metabolic and signalling pathways that contain positive and negative feedback mechanisms to control system dynamics. I believe that these can complement the research from this junior fellowship, and initiate a new research direction that is truly multidisciplinary in nature, i.e. social science, project management, computer science, and biochemistry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is envisaged that the majority of beneficiaries will come from the IT Consulting and Services sector, for instance third-party service providers or large software vendors, who will be able to use the findings to adapt the way they manage large multi-vendor software programmes. In addition, as the larger software implementations also require considerable resources from the customer, the findings are also applicable to the customer base, such as large commercial organizations or the Public Sector (NHS, central Government Departments, etc), who can use the findings to adapt the way that they contract for work on multi-vendor programmes, and how they manage the interactions between team members from the various organizations.

Additionally, the findings can be taken forward by the academic community, as this work firmly positions the role that conflict and trust can play in the complex emergent behaviours that arise through inter-group and intra-group interactions within large software programmes. As parallels can be drawn with system dynamics from other disciplines (such as biology and physics), there is also potential in the longer=term to develop a new multidisciplinary area of research that utilises knowledge and research approaches from computer science, management, social science and the natural sciences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6F58BCB-9C04-43BB-8E06-F507B8A81C17</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543fa1fd085649.36009355</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Documentation developed during the course of my SAMS-ESRC-UKCES Management and Business Development Fellowship (Grant No ES/L002612/1).</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB0824C1-7044-4E58-BD87-B6996442C704</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not presently applicable.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565857b0508584.99561645</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset for SAMS-ESRC-UKCES MBD Fellowship (Grant No ES/L002612/1)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/rdm/data-catalogue/researchdata-48/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1E0110F2-0E5D-48EA-B72F-83E3D83AA31F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lessons learned on development and application of agent-based models of complex dynamical systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6682b85c220c8c8bd534e7066c4856a9"><gtr:id>6682b85c220c8c8bd534e7066c4856a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williams R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a53abfaeb68f4.24220761</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002612/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BDA5E012-C5EA-48C7-B1D8-594821FDC78E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Operations Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B8E7153C-9FE1-4987-A37B-98408DC227F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Administration</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
