To address this goal, I will analyse an extensive existing dataset containing information on more than 10,000 individuals of bird and small mammal species captured with a standardised protocol in 65 forest patches of different sizes and connectivity located in six landscapes of the imperilled Atlantic Forest of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (three continuous landscapes with over 90% forest cover and three fragmented landscapes with 10, 30 and 50% forest cover respectively). To understand the causes of species responses, I will analyse this dataset to determine: (i) which mechanisms underlie community changes and what drives community dynamics in fragmented landscapes. To address this question, I will use a novel theoretical framework in which the biological bases responsible for structuring communities are tested against neutral models; these results will allow me to assess the extent to which communities deviate from neutrality and to identify which traits are the best predictors of species extinction. Hypotheses about community disassembly are virtually untested in fragmented landscapes, let alone the poorly studied Atlantic Forest, but have important implications for conservation biology. If species responses to deforestation are mainly due to stochastic processes, then any effort to predict the structure of future communities, and possibly prevent species extinction to deforestation, would be highly ineffective. Sequential species extinction following deforestation causes changes in the structure and composition of communities. Moreover, species differ in the ways by which they process resources, in their effects on the environment, and in how they interact with other species. Consequently, reductions to the number of species can decrease the number of ecosystem functions being performed (functional diversity).Thus, to understand the consequences of species resposes to deforestation, I will assess (ii) how species extinction affects the number of ecosystem functions performed (functional diversity) and (iii) how the response traits that render species susceptible to deforestation might be correlated with the effect traits that determine their function in the ecosystem. The results from these analyses will allow me to identify (iv) which species are more important for keeping ecosystems functioning and should thus be the target of conservation strategies. I also aim to study (v) the interaction between species extinction thresholds and the decline of functional diversity in fragmented landscapes. Finally, by combining all this information it will be possible to estimate (vi) the minimum area requirements necessary to sustain a functional ecosystem. These questions will be tested with the use of analytical frameworks developed in several areas within biology, drawing together advances in phylogenetics, population biology, community ecology, landscape ecology, and multivariate statistics. Therefore, with this project I aim to advance the scientific understanding of the processes that govern community dynamics in fragmented landscapes and the consequences of landscape alteration for maintaining a functional ecosystem, and will generate solid predictions that can be used for building objective and accurate conservation strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>272647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I found that the community composition of Atlantic Forest birds is strongly influenced by habitat loss at the patch and landscape scale, while species richness is largely unaffected. Modelling results revealed that the compositional changes observed in the Atlantic Forest was only matched by models ruled by species turnover akin to what would be observed along natural gradients. Such deterministic changes in community composition reveal that communities are not structured by neutral forces, and that assembly rules do not change with habitat loss or fragmentation (Banks-Leite et al. 2012 Ecology). 

Observed deterministic changes driven by habitat loss are caused by a referential loss species with a particular set of traits. Within the bird community, for instance, species that have narrow geographic ranges, low relative abundance, and are specialised in specific habitats are more likely to go extinct (Hatfield, Orme and Banks-Leite in prep). Considering birds, mammals and amphibians altogether, the single most important trait is endemism to the Atlantic Forest, as endemics are more sensitive to habitat loss than species that can occur in other biomes, showing that extinction in this biome will lead to global extinction (Banks-Leite et al. Science 2014). The extinction of Atlantic Forest bird species is also likely to lead to a reduction in the number of ecosystem functions performed. In particular, there is less bird-mediated pollination and weaker control of insect populations in degraded and fragmented areas of Atlantic Forest (de Coster, Metzger &amp;amp; Banks-Leite Proc B 2015). 

I also observed the existence of extinction thresholds for birds, mammals and amphibians of the Atlantic Forest, and through the use of phylogenetic analyses I have also observed the existence of a threshold in phylogenetic diversity (potentially strongly correlated to functional diversity). Community composition and phylogenetic beta-diversity does not vary much between continuously forested areas (100% forest cover) and fragmented landscapes with up to 30% forest cover. However, below this value community composition and phylogenetic beta-diversity change dramatically. These results are caused by an interplay between the loss of sensitive endemics and a gain of widespread generalists. Changes in phylogenetic beta-diversity could indicate that the functions being provided in areas below the 30% forest cover threshold are very different to the functions provided in more pristine areas. 

The minimum area needed to sustain a viable and functional ecosystem is 30% of forest cover at the landscape scale. However, most of the Atlantic Forest is below this amount of forest cover, which means much of this biome has to be restored and that payment for ecosystem services could be an advantageous strategy to protect biodiversity. Taking the average PES payment across the biome, US$ 100 ha-1 per year, it would cost just over US$ 50 mi per year to target restoration at 30% cover. Such effort would lead to an increase ecosystem functions by nearly 7%. These results are not only novel to science but also give a crucial tool to conservation managers and practitioners in preserving one of the most endangered Biodiversity Hotpots of the world.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings can be directly used by the Brazilian government to conserve and manage the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DBC5018-EF7A-418C-BFB1-A22ADC317E6D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df3d99b3e0c2.59279796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23AADBF4-E09D-4D12-B8E5-E82D989D02EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fragmentation impairs the microclimate buffering effect of tropical forests.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ed6e548c5b7367989d8076923e4b2353"><gtr:id>ed6e548c5b7367989d8076923e4b2353</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ewers RM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55fa9ca9cb52af90</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28BA7FD2-352B-4E2F-96B0-E1EA5CE1E8F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Atlantic forest bird communities provide different but not fewer functions after habitat loss.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
