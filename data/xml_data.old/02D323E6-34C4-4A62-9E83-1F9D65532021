network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L015803/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Over the last half century, many minority faith groups have established new places of worship, particularly in urban centres. Such places of worship are significant for bringing communities together, especially for first generation migrants, and assisting with many aspects of integrating into British life. These places of worship can also be powerful symbols of a minority faith group's place within Britain, with their distinctive religious expressions proclaiming both a right to belong and to be different.

Minority faith group places of worship are not without controversy. Faith group representatives tell of difficulties in finding premises and/or obtaining planning permission. Local communities near to such places of worship sometimes are concerned about impact on their locality. Planners and policy professionals are required to balance a complex set of claims and interests, sometimes with limited understanding of the religious issues involved.

Humanities researchers have an important contribution to make towards this neglected area of public policy (e.g. Theology, Religious Studies, Cultural Geography, History). Research over the last 15 years in Britain has identified points of tension between minority faith groups and planning policy regarding places of worship. Researchers in different disciplines have concluded that in centres such as London, Birmingham, Leicester, and Northampton, planning policy is not keeping up with the changing religious landscape. This is seen in increasingly diverse uses of faith group premises, which stretch existing planning categories and assumptions, as well as in the rapid growth of some minority faith groups for whom there are often not enough suitable premises available. Parallel stories have also been heard from urban centres in Europe. Conclusions so far point to the need for reviewing this area of planning policy and its implementation, which in part would require questioning the majority cultural assumptions woven into established planning policy. However, until now, the evidence and perspectives of researchers and stakeholders has been largely disconnected.

The Faith and Place network therefore aims to address this disconnection, through engaging academics from multiple disciplines with 4 key stakeholder groups, namely faith group representatives, local community representatives, planners and policy professionals. This engagement will be established through 3 events between Sep '14 and Aug '15, complemented by a network website. These events will look at the ways in which planning policy shapes faith group practices, through its influence upon matters such as architecture, styles of prayer / worship and local community engagement. As this is also a European issue, the network will incorporate participants working in urban contexts within the Netherlands, Germany, France and Sweden, as well as support mutual knowledge exchange through investigator visits. New researchers and research students will have reserved places in the network, so as to build up the Humanities contribution to this area of knowledge and public policy.

As a result of bringing this network together, we expect to influence and inform public policy on faith, place and planning through dissemination of the network's conclusions, which will be published as a policy brief at the final network symposium. This will be of benefit to all the stakeholder groups through an updated planning policy with a better fit to the religious changes that have taken place in our cities, alongside more appropriate guidance for those who need to abide by and implement policy. We intend to collaborate with Tate Modern to communicate the issues through artistic forms, and collaborate with those seeking to produce faith premises guides. Case study material and papers on the website will benefit stakeholder groups struggling with these issues, and also alert Humanities researchers to the public policy impact of their work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the Faith and Place network can be summarised in terms of enriching our cultural understandings of minority faith groups, improving the public service offered by planning departments, and influencing public policy on faith, place and planning. The beneficiaries of this research network are academics from multiple disciplines; policy makers and planners at national, regional and local authority levels; faith groups at national, regional, denominational and local levels; local communities where minority faith groups have a significant built presence; as well as intermediary organisations that engage with both faith groups and local communities.

Breaking this down further, the following groups will benefit in these ways:

Policy professionals and planners at the local level (e.g. planning departments, MPs), regional level (e.g. Greater London Authority), and national level (e.g. Department for Communities and Local Government, Royal Town Planning Institute, MPs, Planning consultants) will benefit from a connected and coherent evidence base that can inform a review of policy and its implementation, as well as improved guidance for planners. The policy brief emerging from the network process will be the focus for this engagement. Through identifying examples of UK and European best practice in relation to faith, place and planning, the network may also be able to inform a review of planning guidance. A valuable additional benefit will be that Humanities researchers recognise the public policy impact of their work, but equally, policy makers and planners might see the value of such research as well.

Faith groups at the national (e.g. National Church Leaders' Forum, Evangelical Alliance, Samen Kirk in Nederland), regional (e.g. Anglican Diocese of Southwark, Churches Together in South London) and local level will benefit directly from our collaboration on faith premises guides, which are designed to aid faith groups in navigating the planning system. More significantly, a review of planning policy, implementation and guidance should be of benefit to faith groups in terms of improving public services - key case study material on the network website will fulfil a similar function. The dissemination of the network conclusions (e.g. workshop video, participant articles) through a range of faith group networks will enable increased understanding of the varied spatial needs and practices between different faith groups, and promote social cohesion.

UK and European academics from Humanities and other disciplines will benefit from the development of a new cross-disciplinary dialogue achieved through fusing academic horizons around a common policy focus (see Academic Beneficiaries). Academic capacity in the field will be developed through reserving places for research students and new researchers, making key case studies of places of worship available, producing the edited volume, knowledge exchange with European counterparts, and enhancing the potential for follow-on research projects. Intermediary organisations, such as the Community Action Group, who have also conducted research on faith, place and planning, will also benefit in similar ways to academics.

Local communities where there is a significant minority faith group presence (in terms of places of worship) need to be represented in the network (e.g. councillors, community activists). Although the hardest to reach due to the scale, making selected network findings available to the wider public would aid enriched understanding of faith group practices, especially in relation to places of worship. The most suitable media here would be video of the grassroots histories / experiences of finding a place of worship. This would sit alongside the collaboration with Tate Modern, which is already looking at ways of communicating the reinvention of space by faith groups through photography, and will be developed further for this network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33788</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Following on from the Sunday Service exhibition, Chloe Dewe Mathews oversaw a short film of new black majority churches in Southwark, exhibited at a pop up gallery in Peckham.

This was stimulated by a discussion document (internal to the network) that had been produced after the first event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16384760d71.35960155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://faithandplacenetwork.org/events/explorations-event/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Faith and Place network website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2918C3C-601C-4609-9ED1-02AEBAFA16EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We generated our own network website using Wordpress which enabled us to keep it up to date with news of the network, with plenty of engagement focussed content, such as downloads, images and videos of events and interviews with network participants.

The briefing has been endorsed by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) (the professional body for town planners, the Department for Communities and Local Government (Housing and Planning minister), and a number of religious organisations, including the Archbishop of Canterbury. The network only finished in Feb 2016 but we have already seen impacts from the RTPI (see select committee impact) and Hackney Council (see noise control team impact). Given the good level of dissemination of the policy briefing (see dissemination to LAs engagement and various news / broadcast engagements), we anticipate ongoing take-up of the briefing in practice by local planning authorities and faith groups in the coming year.

In 2017, we have seen the briefing being used to influence the formation of Scottish planning policy in relation to faith and place, and we have provided evidence to Bracknell Forest council for their Infrastructure Delivery Plan. Currently, our findings are informing the Religious Meeting Places project (see collaborations) where the PI and CI are academic consultants shaping the design and execution of the project, drawing on our Faith and Place network experience and expertise.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BBC7D342-B0A4-46AF-B892-B2E3255FE393</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e18b479dee91.50925775</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research network aimed to bring together academics and practitioners for the first time to address the critical issues at the interface between faith groups, places of worship and the planning system. The network worked towards producing a policy briefing (the funding award had a public policy highlight) which it did, containing five groups of recommendations for local planning authorities AND faith groups, as well as other interested parties. There were 15 recommendations in all, addressing ways to improve understanding between local planning authorities and faith groups; recognising the different geographies of faith groups (local or dispersed) and their contribution to communities; paying attention to equality and diversity in regard to faith group planning applications; sharing creative practice through case studies; reviewing aspects of planning policy in relation to places of worship.

In July 2016 we gained small additional funding in order to produce a bilingual policy briefing that focussed on the Welsh devolved planning context. The research findings remain largely the same, but some alterations were made to account for Planning Policy Wales and case studies were changed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Local planning authorities may want to consider how their policies and implementation line up with the briefing. In particular, an obvious way forward would be to generate a dossier of creative practice case studies as well as guidance for planners and faith communities. We have discussed this with network members and professional organisations / faith based organisations may be able to partially support such an enterprise. This will be the focus of any follow-on projects. In addition, the higher education curriculum for planners is a matter we argue should be under review, and my Co-I and colleagues are well placed to take this forward.

Our current project with CAG Consultants, Land Use Consultants and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham indicates that other local authorities might well want act on our findings through projects designed to improve relations between faith groups and local planning authorities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1B4FAF1C-6727-4815-A933-CA3E12AD0625</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e187dfaf2c71.91993059</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://faithandplacenetwork.org/download/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provided evidence of research to Bracknell Forest council for their Infrastructure Delivery Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B729818-1755-4760-8EB0-9AFB9224DD5D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c1a490cb7e50.11239904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>RTPI use briefing as evidence at select committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7547D553-5CCA-47EC-B4C2-60EBE358705E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16b3268b5d9.99797935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hackney Council noise team workshop</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8F9AB5A-86A7-455B-9FE0-AED142BD5AE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I quote from the Hackney noise team leader, which was local largely to Hackney borough and affected attitudes within faith groups towards local government.

Just to let you know that I found the briefing we attended in October very interesting and I am very grateful that we were invited. About a month ago, we organised another works shop on Noise Nuisance emanating from Faith Venues, and I introduced it taking into account your recommendations, in the sense that I explained that your research showed that Religious groups were in the increase in the UK and the need for better understanding of their needs and therefore the need for dialog, and this had a very good reaction in the audience and it helps for them to open up and debate issues without feeling they are being under attack.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16d9373ee32.75452050</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Newham Council Community Infrastructure paper</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>158009DF-FFE6-4DF7-9828-11DD67A1594C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16c49080439.03414213</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/EB13.%20Topic%20Paper%20Community%20Infrastructure%20Dec%202015.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on Paul Ede in relation to Scottish planning policy (email of 8/11/16)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F80535A3-C9A4-435E-A573-12307EF4BAE9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c1a37421f142.29188290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on research design and execution of Religious Meeting Places project by CAG consultants</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2C16986-BB68-4202-81A2-31020B7695B8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca864e8cfa84.20564664</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D32ADD3-973D-4001-95E5-A578582626C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Faith Groups and the Planning System: Policy Briefing (England)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ab67e380e91eeb7dd389ee50a91e5f74"><gtr:id>ab67e380e91eeb7dd389ee50a91e5f74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rogers A P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dedc0058b418.67734805</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9FC708F-204D-4FB2-B2B9-2B17F0CD6187</gtr:id><gtr:title>Faith Groups and the Planning System: Policy Briefing (Wales)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ab67e380e91eeb7dd389ee50a91e5f74"><gtr:id>ab67e380e91eeb7dd389ee50a91e5f74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rogers A P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c1864c2da9b3.67793863</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L015803/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp;
