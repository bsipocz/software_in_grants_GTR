Unfortunately over time many pests have evolved resistance to the insecticides used for control. Insects have been shown to develop resistance in two main ways. Firstly by changes in the protein that the insecticide binds to which means that it is no longer as sensitive to the toxic effect of the insecticide and secondly by increased production of enzymes that break down or bind to the insecticide and render it ineffective. In this proposal we aim to study insecticide resistance in two important crop pests the peach potato aphid (Myzus persicae) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). M. persicae is a major pest on a range of crops in the UK and Europe and N. lugens is a major pest of rice crops in Asia, both cause damage to plants through direct feeding and the transmission of viruses resulting in high economic losses. Both of these crop pests have evolved resistance to many of the insecticides used for their control and the main chemical class currently being used is the neonicotinoids. However reports of resistance to this insecticide class have recently been described. Biochemical studies have shown that this resistance is likely to be caused by increased production of enzymes that break down the insecticide, in particular a group of enzymes called cytochrome P450 monooxgenases (P450s). P450s are a class of enzymes with many functions including the breakdown of toxins and insects have been found to have between 46-143 P450 genes, each producing a different enzyme. Insect pests can become resistant to insecticides by increasing the amount of one or more of the P450 enzymes they produce. In this project we aim to examine if resistance in M. persicae and N. lugens to neonicotinoids is caused by over-production of P450s and determine which P450s are involved and why they are over-produced. It is not easy to study the large gene families involved in metabolic resistance however recent advances in the field of genomics (the study of genes and their function) and new associated technologies means that it is now more feasible. This study will exploit these new resources to identify P450 genes in the target pest species. These include the genome (the entire DNA content of an organisms) sequences of a number of insect species (including an aphid), expressed sequence tags or ESTs (small pieces of DNA sequence usually 200 to 500 nucleotides long that are generated by sequencing either one or both ends of an expressed gene) and affordable high-throughput sequencing technologies that allow many hundreds of millions of bases (a unit of DNA) of sequence to be determined in a matter of hours. The identified P450 genes will then be studied using new molecular methods that allow determination of the levels of expression of genes into RNA and protein. The technique RNA interference (the introduction of double-stranded RNA into a cell to inhibit the expression of a gene) will be used to silence P450 genes and therefore examine their role in resistance. Finally the P450 genes will be cloned and expressed as protein to see if they break down or bind to insecticide. When the specific P450s involved in resistance in these crop pests have been identified we will develop diagnostic tools to monitor insect populations for resistance. These are an essential requirement of resistance management strategies which aim to slow or prevent the development of resistance. Prolonging the life of insecticides by managing resistance is vital as there are only a limited number of insecticides available for control and proposed new legislation on pesticides from the European Parliament will dramatically cut the availability of insecticides for use in agriculture. This project will be carried out in collaboration with partners in agrochemical companies and the Insecticide Resistance Action Group to ensure the findings of this study can be rapidly exploited.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Insecticide resistance in crop pests has been an ongoing problem since the introduction of synthetic insecticides in the 1940's and has been shown to develop through two main mechanisms 1) the increased production of enzymes which can break down or bind to the insecticide and 2) structural changes in the target protein that render it less sensitive to the toxic effects of the insecticide. In this proposal we aim to study insecticide resistance in two important crop pests the peach potato aphid (Myzus persicae) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). M. persicae is a major pest on a range of crops in the UK and Europe and N. lugens is a major pest of rice crops in Asia, both cause damage to plants through direct feeding and the transmission of viruses resulting in high economic losses. The main insecticide class currently used to control M. persicae and N. lugens are the neonicotinoids, however reports of resistance to this insecticide class have recently been described and there is strong evidence that elevated cytochrome P450 monooxgenases may be a contributing cause. In the proposed study we will explore the role that P450s play in metabolic resistance to neonicotinoids in the two pest species. We will identify P450 genes in M. persicae and N. lugens by exploiting genomic resources and new associated technologies that have recently become available including &amp;gt;24 insect genome sequences (including the recently sequenced pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genome), EST databases and affordable high-throughput sequencing technologies. Identified P450s will then be studied using state-of-the art post-genomic technologies including quantitative PCR, microarrays, RNAi and functional expression to identify which enzymes are involved in resistance and why they are over-expressed. The findings will be exploited to develop diagnostic tools to monitor populations for resistance as part of management strategies which aim to slow or prevent the development of resistance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>672472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bayer CropScience Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bayer CropScience</gtr:description><gtr:id>942C804F-04A2-4813-A19A-95299E230BEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2583.2011.01105.x.

The results of the survey confirmed the presence of neonicotinoid resistant aphids in many of the stone fruit orchards of southern France and North East Spain as well as in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. However we did not identify aphids with the mutation in other crops. In addition to publishing this work in a scientific journal I also discussed these findings at a meeting of the 'Sucking Insect Pest Working Group' (attending as an invited expert), held in Barcelona in 2012 and we devised practical recommendations for growers (see http://www.irac-online.org/content/uploads/econnection291.pdf).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EADEDA75-42C4-4939-A8C8-52BBDFB22E39</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464e183634529.83461951</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Many insect pests of agricultural crops are often largely controlled using chemical insecticides. Unfortunately over time many of the most economically important insect pests have evolved resistance to the insecticides used for control. In this proposal we studied insecticide resistance in several important crop pests with particular emphasis on the peach potato aphid (Myzus persicae) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). M. persicae is a major pest on a range of crops in the UK and Europe and N. lugens is a major pest of rice crops in Asia, both cause damage to plants through direct feeding and the transmission of viruses resulting in high economic losses. Both of these crop pests have evolved resistance to many of the insecticides used for their control. In this project we have exploited recent advances in the field of genomics (the study of genes and their function) to identify understand how these important crop pests have become resistant to insecticides. 



To date, we have shown that resistance to an important insecticide class called the neonicotinoids is caused by increased production of enzymes that breaks down the insecticide, in particular members of a class of enzymes called cytochrome P450 monooxgenases (P450s). P450s are a class of enzymes with many functions including the breakdown of toxins. We have shown that the insect pests have become resistant to insecticides by increasing the amount of one or more of the P450 enzymes they produce. For example for the aphid M. persicae we have found that the genome of susceptible aphids can contain two copies of a CYP6-type P450 gene whereas the genome of resistant aphids can have up to 30 copies of the P450. This process is called gene amplification and allows the resistant insects to produce lots of P450 that can break down the inseciticide before it can reach the target-site in the insect nervous system.



We collected, in collaboration with an industrial partner, populations of aphids that are almost immune to neonicotinoid insecticides and showed that such aphids have an additional mechanism underlying resistance. Neonicotinoid insecticides are very selective for insects rather than humans and vertebrates. This is partly because the receptor in the nervous systems of humans is fundamentally different to that of insects. We have shown that aphids have become highly resistant by mutating this receptor to make it more 'human like'.

Finally we have carried out work on other insect pests, such as the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta, an invasive species. Research on this species has investigated the molecular basis of resistance to several insecticide classes including the pyrethroids and spinosyns. We have characterised the mutations that alter the sensitivity of the insecticide target-sites in the insect nervous system and used this knowledge to develop DNA-based diagnostics that can be used to monitor the frequency and distribution of resistance in global populations of this pest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Insect pests such as the aphid Myzus persicae damage our crops and threaten food security. We have carried out cutting-edge research to understand how M. persicae evolves resistance to insecticides. This information was used to develop diagnostic assays that can detect the mechanisms that cause resistance in single aphids. We have applied these tools to monitor changes in resistance in M. persicae throughout Europe. Our research has informed farmers and growers, advisers, regulatory authorities and the agrochemical industry of the resistance status of this pest and has led to management strategies to slow or prevent the development of resistance. Now we have identified the mechanisms underlying resistance we have developed DNA-based diagnostic tools

to monitor insect populations for resistance. These are an essential requirement of resistance management strategies

which aim to slow or prevent the development of resistance. Prolonging the life of insecticides by managing resistance is

vital as there are only a limited number of insecticides available for control. This project is being carried out in collaboration with partners in agrochemical companies and the Insecticide Resistance Action Group to ensure the findings of this study can be rapidly exploited. One example of this is the screening we did (funded by the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC)) to understand how far the mutation causing resistance in aphids had spread from its origin in Southern France. The results of the survey confirmed the presence of neonicotinoid resistant aphids in many of the stone fruit orchards of southern France and North East Spain as well as in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. However we have not found these highly resistant aphids in the UK. We used this information to help devise a resistance management strategy and published a series of reccomendations for growers in the affected countries (see:
