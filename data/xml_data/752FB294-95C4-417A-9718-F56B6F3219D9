Here we aim to gain an understanding of the tests currently employed by these major companies, with an emphasis being placed towards the more important analytes to be measured (for example total THM measurement, or individual species), the number of tests being taken, and also the accuracy at which the readings need to recorded. Once we have obtained this initial market research, we will then aim to use these preliminary meetings to provide further introductions to possible end-users of the technology.
Here we aim to undertake a review of current measurement protocols so we can gain an in depth understanding of present techniques in terms of their limitations and un-met needs. We will then use these findings as a starting point on which to further expand our development protocols.
As our final aim is to possibly provide a device which is capable of measurement of a number of different analytes (such as CHCl3, CHBrCl2, CHBr2Cl and CHBr3), we feel it is important to gain an in-depth knowledge of what is required at the user interface. Input from end-users is vital for us to develop a device which is commercially viable. We already have identified THMs as a possible target analyte; however we also seek information regarding specific THM species for us to develop defined measurement protocols. Differing disinfection protocols will lead to the formation of increased levels of particular THM species (such as increased CHBr3 levels when bromination is employed). Once we have taken advice from end users, we can then implement an investigation into time-scales and costings for the development of sensing devices for each of the required analytes.
We already have in place a rudimentary ?proof-of-concept? development of the methodology required for the determination of one THM species, chloroform. For the determination of chloroform a simple electrochemical technique is employed, upon carbon screen-printed surface that have been modified to microelectrode arrays via our novel fabrication procedures. The measurement protocol is based on the oxidation of the chloroform species on a reverse anodic sweep, where an oxidation peak current is detected and can be related back to the concentration under investigation. To date we have measured down to levels of 1ppm, but we know we need to obtain lower limits of detection in the order of ~80ppm and we require further guidance as to the lower limits of detection required for specific THMs; we intend to obtain this information and further guidance from meetings with potential end users and contacts at each of the highlighted companies.
We would also need to investigate our freedom to seek patent protection for our approach process. We would also begin to establish whether specific components of any possible product, could be protected to gain maximum protection. This exercise will also help us identify any competing patents or other obstacles to allow commercialisation.
Patents within the infringement period that are not in force, but which may clear a ?right-to-use? by virtue of being in the public domain, will also be searched for. When this type of search is followed up with a validity search against any highly relevant patents identified, this is sometimes referred as a 'clearance search'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24950</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700049</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
