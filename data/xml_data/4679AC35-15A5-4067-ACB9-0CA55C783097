Growing and modernising the UK rail infrastructure such as the HS2, Crossrail and many other projects must be complemented by optimised operations planning to maximise its passenger carrying network capacity. 

After a timetable has been finalised, a fleet of train units is scheduled. Each train unit is assigned to serve some train journeys in a sequence and no timetabled journey is left uncovered. Obviously all the train connections for each unit must be feasible, i.e. the unit must be at the right place before its next scheduled departure is due, and the scheduling task is like solving a hugely difficult jigsaw puzzle that the minimum number of train units is to be used. Moreover, some timetabled journeys at peak times may demand more seats than a single train unit can provide. Thus the train units may be purposefully scheduled to overlap in their assignments to achieve the desired combined seat capacity.

Train operating companies are motivated to seek automatic optimised train unit scheduling methods for several reasons. There are very high costs to lease, operate and maintain the train units making them a critical resource for most UK train operating companies, how to spread the train unit resource amongst competing demands is a big challenge. The potential saving in an optimised train unit schedule is very attractive. Good train unit schedules can be derived manually based on experience and local knowledge, but that is usually a very time consuming and tedious process making it impractical to consider many what-if options available to the planners.

Existing research in passenger train unit scheduling is mainly from the Netherlands and Italy, whose models have not included some UK features and have tackled smaller problems than those usually found in the UK. This project builds on recent research in collaboration with ScotRail, which has led to promising results for part of the ScotRail network around Glasgow and Edinburgh. This project aims at yielding fully operable schedules in real life practice to demonstrate the validity and quality of research, and hence further more extensive industrial collaboration is planned.

This 36 month project consists of three parallel work streams. The planned research is grounded on an exact mathematical approach, under which advanced solution techniques and appropriate formulation variations are sought to improve and refine its computational performance. One research fellow will be responsible for this work stream.

While the mathematical approach has superior optimisation power, computational time escalates exponentially to becoming impractical beyond small to medium sized problem instances. In another work stream, the second research fellow will investigate a new method that could make a step change. Recognising that there is a practical limit on how large a problem instance the mathematical optimiser can solve 'comfortably' a heuristics is used to compress and transform, analogous to compression of an image file, the problem instance into a much smaller one for the mathematical solver to be applied. Over a number of cycles, more and more is learnt about the key data points to be retained in the compressed instance whereby the hybridised algorithm would converge to the optimal or very near optimal solution.

In the third work stream, both research fellows will be engaged in activities with our industrial collaborators to ensure that the most realistic model is built, the solution schedules produced are fully operable and testing and evaluation are as thorough as possible. The activities include short placements, regular contacts, on-site testing/evaluation and three seminar workshops that other train companies will also be invited.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will help train companies to produce optimised operational schedules for their train vehicle units. The scheduling process will be automatic and quick due to the advanced algorithms developed. The human planners therefore will have more time to put effort into trying out a much wider range of planning options as input to the scheduling process. Furthermore, heavy involvement of train companies and rail software and consultancy specialist Tracsis Plc in steering this project and at all the stages (problem modelling/formulation, testing and evaluation) will ensure that real life rather than simplified problems are solved. Therefore through this research, train companies will be able to plan more cost efficient and reliable services. The public will enjoy lower fares and better rail transport than otherwise. The impact in this respect would be especially important when UK passenger rail traffic is predicted to double in the next 15 to 20 years. Ultimately a good rail transport system will help bring down energy consumption and lessen environmental issues leading to a better society.

Network flow models and integer linear programming (ILP) are hugely useful for an extremely wide range of problem areas. The advancements of solution techniques in this research will therefore have significant impacts on the relevant research communities seeking ever faster computation. In particular, the branch-and-price framework incorporating convex hull computation and specialised branching and branch-tree traversal strategies will enable all-integer solutions to be found quickly.

ILP solvers often have the drawback of not performing satisfactorily as the size of the problem instance increases, and the difficulty increases exponentially. While this research will make contributions in directly improving the computational performance of ILP solvers, it will also be deriving a hybridised algorithm using iterative heuristics to compress the problem input in each iteration into a small scale instance before applying the ILP solver. The hybridised algorithm approach will be amenable to simple parallelisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>577061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tracsis User Days (20-22 Oct 2015, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CD618E9A-9E22-4679-BF2C-DDA9234CCAA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team for the EPSRC funded project &amp;quot;Train unit scheduling optimisation&amp;quot; presented a talk on rolling stock optimisation to an audience of UK train operating companies, owning group representatives and industry experts at the annual Tracsis user group event.
