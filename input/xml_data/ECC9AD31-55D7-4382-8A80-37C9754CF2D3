The task of making molecules is challenging - an organic molecule containing just a few dozen atoms can easily take many man-years of effort to complete. The result is that many of the molecules we use are compromises - the easiest to make that have acceptable function, rather than being the best for the job. One example is pharmaceuticals when the need to use simple, easy to make compounds leads to cross-activity (interaction with other than the target biological system) as the compromise, and hence undesirable side effects.
The aim of the 'Dial-a-Molecule' Grand Challenge (GC) is to make the synthesis of any desired molecule as easy as dialling a number thus removing a severe constraint to progress in many fields. A linked aim is to make synthesis 100% efficient. Currently in the production of a molecule many times the mass of the desired product (typically 1000's of times) is produced as waste with consequent disposal and cost implications. With 100% efficient synthesis there would be no waste to dispose of and the process would be much cheaper and consume less energy. It is a difficult problem which will require input from many disciplines not currently engaged with synthesis, and we estimate will require 20-40 years to accomplish. We expect that even the initial steps towards the GC will have substantial economic and scientific benefit as so much industry and science relies on access to designed molecules to progress. 

2 years ago the EPSRC established the Dial-a-Molecule network to define a roadmap to the GC and to start to build the cross-disciplinary and industry-academia collaborations needed to deliver it. The network ran a launch meeting (200+ attending), 6 two day workshops (30-40 people at each) to identify the key challenges in theme and focus areas, and a variety of 1 day meetings. It has established a network of over 400 people (38% from industry, and of the academic members 58% are from outside the traditional synthesis area), a web site (www.dial-a-molecule.org), and delivered a draft roadmap to the GC to the EPSRC (final version to be published in April 12). 
The key challenges were identified as: 'Making synthesis predictable', as currently &amp;gt;90% of time is typically spent on failed or far from optimum reactions; 'Smart synthesis by design', as we need to be able to sequence reactions efficient and find the best route to targets; and 'Sustainable synthesis for a sustainable future' as any solution must be economically and environmentally beneficial. It reinforced that transforming synthesis into a more data driven discipline, and building a multi-disciplinary community to tackle the GC were crucial steps.

The current grant seeks funding to extend the network for a 3 year period, at the end of which it expects to be self-sustaining. Although there is still work to be done extending the range and depth of involvement of a number of disciplines, the emphasis of the second phase is on delivering funded groups and consortia to start to tackle the challenges identified in the roadmap. It will run meetings in targeted areas to establish cross disciplinary groups to apply for funding, it will fund knowledge exchange between disciplines and between industry and academia, and will fund some proof-of-concept work in critical areas. It has an active industrial advisory board to ensure that opportunities for early stage commercial exploitation are not missed. The network will also raise the profile of 'Dial-a-Molecule' on both the national and international stage through open meetings, outreach work, and direct interactions with funders and politicians.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Grand Challenge network provides a framework for engaging workers across a wide range of disciplines to deliver next-generation (and beyond) advances in the delivery of molecules 'to order' while addressing the environmental footprint associated with molecular synthesis. The potential impact of such activities is immense:

Knowledge impact:
The network drives fundamental scientific advances - in seeking to maximise the changes in and impact from improvements in chemical synthesis, we engage a broad community of end-users and academics from beyond the 'traditional' pool. It also drives advances in techniques - bringing new technologies from biology, computing, engineering etc into the realms of chemistry and conversely making new chemical tools available to solve problems in eg healthcare, advanced materials, manufacture, energy etc.

Economy:
A key goal of our activities is to &amp;quot;Deliver economic and societal impact from the Grand Challenge&amp;quot;. We have engaged widely with both industrial end-users as well as partners in the supply chain (eg equipment manufacturers and technology suppliers). The support of the Chemistry Innovation KTN in cultivating the broad range of companies with which we have interacted has been key and this support is ongoing in the next phase of the project. We have established forums and funding pathways to ensure strong, mutual-benefit industry-academia interactions are delivered. In particular, the 2-way mobility of industrial/academic personnel to facilitate knowledge exchange is a key mechanism. Our activities support wealth creation through the development of new techniques, strategies and ways of working which will accelerate the development of new/improved products for end-users, while the adoption and translation into industry of the new techniques requires new products (equipment, software and consumables) creating opportunities for the supply chain. We have already engaged many SMEs and the further growth of interactions with this sector is a focus of activity in the coming period. The positioning of the UK as a leader in synthesis for future needs (new applications, improved sustainability) will make the UK an attractive base for companies to base their activities and drive inward investment.

People:
Our goal to &amp;quot;Build a sustainable Grand Challenge Community&amp;quot; is underpinned by development of people. The skillset of researchers (both industrial and academic) required to deliver the scientific and economic goals of Dial-a-Molecule will be much more diverse than has traditionally been the case, and we have a range of mobility and training plans in place to facilitate the learning and adoption of new skills. This will provide a pipeline of researchers skilled in working across broad cross-disciplinary projects who will form the flexible workforce of the future.

Society:
Many facets of Dial-a-Molecule have as their driver or end-goal the move towards sustainable processes/products with reduced environmental footprint and energy usage, which will impact positively upon quality of life. Dial-a-Molecule has much to offer in terms of influencing policy (eg in working towards more environmentally sustainable technologies that may permit accelerated beneficial legislation without jeopardising UK industry). Advances in next-generation healthcare (personalised medicine, diagnostics, theranostics, targeted therapies, drug delivery, modified biologics etc) are all driven by new chemical technologies and the healthcare needs of a growing and ageing population will therefore be addressed by actions arising from Dial-a-Molecule. Finally, Dial-a-Molecule has a role to play in arguing for the importance of continued/increased government investment in UK science by demonstrating the societal and economic benefits that will accrue from its programmes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>450269</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge Network Activity Dissemination</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D3F91B0-AEBF-4AA6-8244-D60AC1C56B66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Activities of the network are disseminated via newsletters, the website, LinkedIN group and Twitter.

We believe that in the long term the developments promoted by Dial-a-Molecule will have a substantial commercial impact in making chemical agent discovery and manufacture cheaper and faster giving the U.K. a competitive advantage in a very important industrial sector. The developments will also impact on the international competitiveness of U.K. academic research with the drive to more modern ways of working, particularly the use of automation and better use of data.

It has established links with key partners including Innovate UK and the Catapult Centers, the TSB, IChemE, RSC, The Royal Society, SCI, STFC Hartree Centre, The Catalysis Hub, CPACT, and CMAC. Many meetings have been organised, often to drive development in new areas such as Closed Loop Optimisation, 3D-printing of reactors, and computer aided synthesis design. We have established an industry lead group aimed at defining a standard for reporting reaction process details, particularly from automated reactors, and have organised trials of Electronic Laboratory Notebooks to promote their use in academia. In order to promote the use of statistical methods in synthesis the network has funded the development of a number of teaching resources to facilitate introduction of the ideas at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Six pump priming grants were awarded to promote development relevant to Dial-a-Molecule, many creating enthusiastic new collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our roadmap forms the basis of many grant applications, and must be quoted for some grant types.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EDF47D65-F6AD-4C78-AF47-2768DE837AB5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e12b1281e8e4.16955141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.dial-a-molecule.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F72DD8B-ACAD-4372-9C7C-44910FE7A65B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recent XAS studies into Homogeneous metal catalyst in fine chemical and pharmaceutical syntheses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry Central journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e83c0e0a6ba81177459b6383d4d2e343"><gtr:id>e83c0e0a6ba81177459b6383d4d2e343</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sherborne GJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1752-153X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>569cada4ae5f09.03561037</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>809D86FA-D48B-46AE-B7F3-80E608D5BA0F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic flow synthesis of porous organic cages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/004bd51851c0dbad81eed2434a908fc1"><gtr:id>004bd51851c0dbad81eed2434a908fc1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Briggs ME</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>569cac31c1efa0.71920761</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>68D8D79A-9EF0-44EA-B674-B01F0D1C626E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tablets in the lab: enabling the flow of chemical synthesis data into a chemistry repository</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Abstracts of Papers of the American Chemical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3ffdb77f0ffd917be6bc2b81aeb5aa2"><gtr:id>a3ffdb77f0ffd917be6bc2b81aeb5aa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simon J.
