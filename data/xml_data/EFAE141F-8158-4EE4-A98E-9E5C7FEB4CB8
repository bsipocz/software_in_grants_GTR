Patients who have CMT4 generally develop it early in life, meaning that they face a lifetime of needing assistance with mobility and basic tasks. It is a progressive disorder, where the myelin insulation slowly stops wrapping properly around the nerves it is meant to insulate. This stops the nerve from sending signals properly to the limbs, leading to both sensory and motor impairment (particularly in the more distant limbs). As this disease slowly gets worse over time, there is a possibility that if we understand what is going wrong, the disease process could be arrested or even reversed by the appropriate therapy.
We wish to study several related genes which all cause CMT4. These have different functions, but work together to move proteins to and from the surface of the cell (we call this trafficking). CMT4 pathologies occur because of the failure of proper trafficking in the cells that make myelin, meaning proteins that should be at the surface of the myelin-making cells don't arrive properly or at the wrong time.

CMT4 pathologies are caused by mutation any of 11 different genes. 5 of these genes (the ones we want to study) make enzymes. 3 of these enzymes (called Frabin, MTMR13, and MTMR5) switch on GTPases. 4 enzymes (called MTMR2, MTMR13, MTMR5 and Fig4) act on a rare lipid (PI(3,5)P2) which helps conduct trafficking in the cell by adding a 'tag' which tells you where inside the cell you are during the trafficking process. Small GTPases are another kind of 'tag'- when they are switched on, they instruct certain groups of proteins to collect on the membrane. Together, lipids like PI(3,5)P2 and proteins like small GTPases can specify a time and a place for the process of moving proteins to the cell surface. For CMT4 patients we still don't know where the important pool of PI(3,5)P2 lipid is in the cell, and what actions that should be co-ordinated by small GTPases are failing to happen in CMT4 patients with mutations in these genes. 
The enzymes mentioned above are the most promising targets for therapies, as they are potentially druggable, or can have their enzymatic activities replaced by other means. This project aims to understand what is going wrong in the cells making myelin and identify the best targets for therapy, preliminary to studies for therapeutic strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project aims to understand the function of a group of related enzymes in membrane trafficking, and how their loss may cause Charcot Marie Tooth Type 4 neuropathies. We aim to identify critical points in the exo-endocytic cycle which may be open to therapeutic manipulation to arrest or reverse this progressive disorder. We will use proteins produced in human cell suspension cultures as material to identify small GTPase interactors of CMT4 genes using label-free differential mass spectrometry and then characterize these interactions in model cells, human patient fibroblasts (where available) and in in vitro Schwann cell- neuron co-cultures. We will use lentiviral treatments of Schwann cells to establish cell-autonomous effects of CMT4 gene manipulations in myelinating cells in these co-cultures. Our second aim will establish tools to acutely manipulate the lipid PI(3,5)P2 in cell culture and in vitro myelinating culture models using the CRY2-CIBN optogenetic system, so as to establish the location and function of the pool of this lipid in (dis)myelination.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Apart from the Academic beneficiaries outlined above, our research will have long-term relevance for several groups:

Directly (2-5 years)- patients and families suffering from Charcot Marie Tooth Type 4 Neuropathies (CMT4). CMT4 is an early-onset disease, where patients often need considerable care and adjustments made to their living situation over the course of a long life. The economic and social benefits of even small improvements in mobility in these patients are considerable. This project aims to find where therapeutic interventions could be made, and to build in vitro assays that could subsequently be used for screens for therapies. Moreover, we will produce results that will help interested parties understand how CMT4 develops, and to help patients and families engage with the process of discovering therapies.

This project will also be training researchers in a novel and growing field of cell biology, and in the use of cutting-edge techniques for transient manipulation of cell biology. The PDRA employed by this project will have an unique and valuable set of experimental tools with which to develop their further career.

In the case of other human pathologies- our data has relevance for neurodegenerative disorders (ALS and PLS) through our studies and manipulation of Fig4 activity with the attendant financial and social benefit if these studies can point the way to therapeutic interventions in these disorders.

In the longer term (5-15 years): It is becoming rapidly apparent that the rare lipid PI(3,5)P2 is at the nexus of several critical signalling pathways (please see academic beneficiaries for a fuller description of the processes so far found to be regulated by PI(3,5)P2). Some of these pathways, such as cell-survival and aging signalling regulated by mTOR, or insulin signaling are pathways that if we can understand and manipulate, will have great implications for public health, given our aging and increasingly sedentary population. Our work here will produce new tools to manipulate this lipid and to understand functionally what is happening to cells where PI(3,5)P2 in specific cellular compartments, and will contribute to ongoing efforts to manipulate cell signaling for improving health and quality of life in the general population.

Economically- this study is aimed towards establishing phenotypes which can be subsequently used for drug discovery screens. This has a direct commercial relevance for biotechnology in the UK, not least because we are studying processes which may be relevant to significantly more than the one set of diseases we are focused on (as I have outlined above). The generation of further basic knowledge and intellectual property centred around this membrane trafficking pathway has the potential to be an unexplored and commercially significant area in biomedical/pharmaceutical healthcare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>421452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Antwerp</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Metablic testing of serum and lymphoblastoid cells of patients with motor neuropathy</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4497079-D4F7-4B91-8425-047B9C26876D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>samples are currently being analysed</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1a83e4f7773.16019894-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof. Timmermann`s group convert the blood cells to lymphoblastoid cells.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We collected serum and blood samples of patients with hereditary motor neuropathies and Prof. Vincent Timmermann`s group converted them to lymphoblastoid cells and conduct metabolomics studies</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCE61741-8CCB-4A67-8528-D6ED566FEFC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mutations in INPP5K Cause a Form of Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Overlapping Marinesco-Sj&amp;ouml;gren Syndrome and Dystroglycanopathy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of human genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1eb962571657a70885c83c1f6b256fd2"><gtr:id>1eb962571657a70885c83c1f6b256fd2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Osborn DPS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9297</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589deb0fd58632.52589909</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>842A8237-3416-4373-A20D-3875CA459E28</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mutations in INPP5K, Encoding a Phosphoinositide 5-Phosphatase, Cause Congenital Muscular Dystrophy with Cataracts and Mild Cognitive Impairment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of human genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/89908175448c0c1995147b7e31e8bdd1"><gtr:id>89908175448c0c1995147b7e31e8bdd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wiessner M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9297</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589deb1007a153.14856580</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N010035/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
