seismic hazard in the continents</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/J01995X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Between 2 and 2.5 million people have died in earthquakes since 1900, and approximately two-thirds of those deaths have occurred in the continental interiors, far from the plate boundaries. Over this time interval, advances in the scientific understanding of earthquakes have been translated into impressive resilience in regions where the hazard is well understood (eg California, Chile, and Japan). Here, resilience is defined as the ability of a community to resist, accommodate, or adapt to the effects of an earthquake, to maintain critical basic functions, and to recover after the event. 

Comparable advances have not, however, taken place in most parts of the continental interiors. Instead, many parts of the continental interiors, and particularly the Alpine-Himalayan belt, have seen a major increase in vulnerability to earthquakes in the last few decades, due to a wide range of social, economic, and governance issues. Increasing resilience to continental earthquakes and their related hazards is therfore an urgent scientific and societal priority. This goal requires a holistic view of earthquakes, and collaboration between physical scientists, social scientists, practitioners, and governments on a scale that has not yet been attempted. Our project knits together three groups with extensive and successful track records in (i) the science of earthquakes and related hazards [COMET+, the Dynamic Earth and Geohazards research group in the National Centre of Earth Observation, and the British Geological Survey Hazards Group] (ii) exploring the social science of resilience to emerging hazards and risks [Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience, University of Durham, and associated researchers] and (iii) the use of research to promote evidence-based policy [Overseas Development Institute].

First, we shall establish a global partnership between researchers from six UK universities, two UK research centers, and representatives of a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organisations from countries across the Alpine-Himalayan belt. This partnership will be focused on communication and sharing of research needs and knowledge gaps, basic research findings and outputs, and new approaches for building resilience to earthquakes across the region.

This partnership will carry out coupled physical- and social-science research in three case-study areas (China, central Asia, and the Himalayan front). Our understanding of earthquake occurrence across this large region is currently too poor to provide detailed estimates of likely earthquake probabilities and effects at the sub-national scales needed by communities - let alone to provide forecasts of earthquake occurrence. 

One component of the project involves research into the locations of active faults across the region, the rates at which they are currently deforming, and the ground shaking that they are likely to produce. This basic physical science research, which will also include the effects of secondary hazards such as landsliding, will provide baseline scenarios about the hazards in forms that are meaningful for, and usable by, the communities at risk.

At the same time, we shall map and identify the societal factors that help or hinder the creation of resilience to those physical hazards. This holistic approach to resilience will include investigation of cultural practices and adaptations, economic considerations, social mechanisms, and the role that governance at all scales plays in determining how resilience communities are to earthquakes.

The overall framework of this project, provided by the ODI's RAPID methodology, will allow us to draw upon the expertise of the partner organisations, and the research findings outlined above, to generate a set of evidence-based toolkits and policy recommendations that together will define the pathways by which resilience to earthquakes can best be increased, both in the case-study areas and across the entire partnership.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate impact of this work will be in the countries participating in the study. These countries have a number of government-funded or -run institutions with responsibility for seismic hazard assessment and planning, such as the GSI (Iran), CEA (China) and Ministry of Emergencies (Kazakhstan). These bodies will benefit through identification of earthquake-related hazards; capacity building through training of students/researchers and exposure to the wider earthquake hazard community; and evidence-based information to influence policy decisions.

National and international NGOs, and regional organizations and networks will benefit from development of more systematic approaches to assessing vulnerability and building resilience; understanding of the governance `landscape' that underpins their activities; and provision of materials and expertise for training and education. Training activities will include both project-specific courses run by ODI in Y4-5, and input of research results and expertise into training programmes run by our partners. The ODI-run courses will focus on policy makers and operational agency staff; training run in collaboration with our partners will include techniques for physical hazard and vulnerability assessment.

During the lifetime of this project, we expect that the benefits will flow to other nations in Eurasia, particularly the Central Asian republics, where there are comparble seismic hazards, and there are already expressions of interest at high political levels for joining the partnership. In addition, the surveys of other nations, particularly Italy, Greece, and Turkey, will both contribute to, and derive benefit from the earthquake science carried out under this partnership.

The project will also have significant impact on the Global Earthquake Model (GEM), a public-private partnership to develop a global understanding of earthquake risk. NERC and BGS are partners in GEM, and some COMET+ investigators are already contributing their own inputs on faults and countries they have been studying. Several of our overseas Partners are also their own national representatives on GEM, so there are multiple and clear links to make sure the new science from this Partnership, which will be highly relevant, is channelled effectively into the GEM project.

The Insurance and Risk Industry, both in the UK and overseas, is concerned with earthquake hazard and catastrophe planning. It is a principal driver behind the GEM project and is clearly interested in the constantly-evolving understanding of earthquake hazard. We are well connected to this industry through: (1) the BGS and NERC Council, which includes Mr. Rowan Douglas of Willis Re; (2) the COMET+ Advisory Board, which includes Dr. Andrew Coburn of Risk Management Solutions (RMS); (3) Prof. Robin Spence of Cambridge Architectural Research Ltd, who is a member of the Willis Research Network and on the Scientific Board of GEM.

Large, damaging earthquakes are rarely out of the news for long, and the public appetite for informed and clear explanations of natural catastrophes is insatiable. Such events are virtually certain to occur during the duration of an this project. We shall pursue energetically the opportunities to engage with the public through lectures, broadcasts, web sites and briefings to UK government agencies and NGOs. Many of the investigators on this proposal are regularly engaged in this activity.

Education will form an enduring impact of this project. We confidently expect that exceptional young researchers from the counties involved will be attracted into this programme and will be able to pursue graduate studies or post-docotoral work, through state-sponsored, or philanthropic support. This is a route through which we have in the past helped countries such as Iran and Mongolia to grow their capacity in earthquake science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>762510</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department for International Development (DfID)</gtr:department><gtr:description>DFID Nepal</gtr:description><gtr:id>35363C2C-1A35-4115-80DD-A1DE2004ECA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c200e7a150d4.78024999-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Facilitation of contacts with Humanitarian Country Team in Nepal</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Advice to Nepal country office on earthquake and landslide hazard before and after 2015 Gorkha earthquakes

The review (Oven et al., 2016b) found that the Nine Minimum Characteristics have been effective in building resilience in some communities, especially those where the hazard is broadly recognised by the community and where DRR activities can also address livelihood concerns. In other settings, for example where there is disagreement about the nature of the threat or where there is little support available at VDC or district level, the Characteristics have not been as effective. The review concluded that the Characteristics are most useful as a unified but flexible framework for designing and implementing DRR activities, in contrast to more rigid devices such as the Local Disaster Relief Management Plan.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kulima Integrated Development Solutions</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Earthquakes without Frontiers</gtr:description><gtr:id>43629D7B-452C-4785-ACE3-ABDE0ACFB900</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary: Earth sciences, physical geography, human geography, social work/applied social sciences, policy</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5453b9175ee283.16018029-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners are working with us in the three case-study regions (China, Nepal-India, and Kazakhstan) as collaborators and co-producers of knowledge in the three areas outlined above.

1) providing transformational increases in knowledge of primary and secondary seismic hazards in the continental interiors;

2) identifying pathways to increased resilience in the populations exposed to these hazards; and

3) through engagement with partners and stakeholders, secure the uptake and impact of the knowledge and understandings generated by the project both over its duration and subsequently through establishing an enduring partnership.

The project is focused on three countries - China, Kazakhstan and Nepal - but through the partnership a trans-national network has been established that has led to the exchange of knowledge and expertise with other countries at risk from earthquakes in the Alpine-Himalayan belt. In line with the transdisciplinary approach that has been adopted, the specific focus areas in each case-study country have emerged from interactions between the disciplines represented in the project team and through engagement with stakeholders in the focus countries and with partners.

Throughout the work, we have adopted a transdisciplinary approach in which we:

aim to shape processes in society, rather than just analyse them;

work closely with stakeholders in society, integrating their perspectives and knowledge with our own; and

take account of local conditions and possibilities for action in order to generate socially robust knowledge, and secure its uptake and impact.

Activities and findings of the project to date that are specific to Durham University can be summarised as follows; research by other university partners is summarised separately.

1. We have successfully launched the project and the partnership through a series of meetings with project partners in Cambridge (19-21 Oct 2012), Patna (12 Jan 2013), and Kathmandu (16 Jan 2013). Launch events in China took place in 2013 in Xian and Beijing. A mid-project meeting occured in Kathmandu (11-13 April 2015). These meetings are critical for talking to stakeholders and identifying the key research unknowns in each of the focus countries.

2. We have completed mapping exercises designed to assess the state of knowledge and activity around earthquake disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Bihar, India, and Nepal, working directly with Indian and Nepali partners. These have included a set of structured interviews with key stakeholders and community groups.

3. We have assessed the state of knowledge and earthquake DRR activities in Kazakhstan, and have identified project partners in both the university and NGO sectors, including the Red Crescent Society, al-Faraby Kazakh National University, Taraz State University, and Shymkent University. We are currently engaged in a range of specific research activities designed to assess the effectiveness of these local partners in building resilience.

4. We have identified the use of science in earthquake disaster risk reduction as a major unknown. The improved or enhanced use of science has been identified by numerous organisations as a priority issue, but it remains unclear how this can best be done, or what benefits might accrue, at community, regional, or sub-national scales. In Nepal, we carried out a major review of how science is used in earthquake disaster risk reduction, involving focus group discussions with scientists, practitioners, donors, UN organisations, and engineers. This study revealed some major gaps in the use of science, particularly around mechanisms for inclusion of up-to-date earthquake science and the use of scenarios.

5. A major related strand of work has been to develop earthquake scenarios for Nepal, for use in contingency planning. We have built upon recent advances in scenario design, including the development of open-access shaking algorithms and new approaches to modelling secondary hazards such as landslides, to develop a suite of scenarios for possible future earthquakes in Nepal. We are working with the humanitarian sector in Nepal to refine these scenarios and to apply them to planning exercises.

6. We are currently undertaking collaborative work with partners in Nepal and Kazakhstan to trial different approaches toward the use of science in earthquake disaster risk reduction efforts. Work in eastern Nepal has shown the value of landslides as an entry point in engaging communities to think about earthquake disaster risk reduction, and we have been exploring the use of community disaster management groups and early warning systems in those communities to introduce science into decision making processes. Similar work in Kazakhstan has pointed out the importance of community structures in enabling DRR activities.

7. The occurrence of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence in Nepal has had a substantial impact on our work in that case-study area. We have established the extent and impact of earthquake-triggered landslides in the region, and have monitored landsliding through the 2015 monsoon season and beyond. Our work shows that the earthquake triggered the equivalent of several hundred years' worth of landslides, focused mostly on the High Himalayan areas far from the epicentre. The subsequent monsoon triggered landslides at a rate that is about an order of magnitude greater than a 'typical' monsoon, most likely due to cracking and damage of the hillslopes by seismic shaking. The impacts of the earthquake have continued to be felt through the 2016 monsoon, and we anticipate that the 2017 monsoon will show similarly elevated rates of landslide activity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research is aimed specifically at a non-academic goal - namely, increasing resilience to earthquakes in communities across the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. While the project is still ongoing, we anticipate that our results will be most relevant to both governmental and non-governmental organisations that are charged with planning for major earthquakes, because our efforts are focused on factors which make affected populations more or less resilient (rather than on, for example, the best ways to respond to a given earthquake). The results of the research will be achieved in close contact and collaboration with our external (non-academic partners). The precise route by which the research will be exploited will vary in each of the three focus countries and across the partnership more widely, due to differences in the cultural, societal, and governmental approach to earthquake DRR. These differences are themselves a focus of our research. In the final year of the project (2017-2018), our emphasis will be on drawing lessons from the comparisons between different case-study countries and organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DCC6E17-3357-4BEF-9B0C-2A6A46552175</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2703053543.9989095776d4efa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ewf.nerc.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>2015 Gorkha earthquake: advice to NGOs</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>568A7B18-8D57-4913-A3C7-E0420263A189</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c23b33aa3e55.43728840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>2015 Gorkha earthquake: advice to UK government</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>078B28F3-A212-475F-86C4-F3D18BD8F7DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c1fd2c37bcc3.58453165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Support for community hazard assessment by National Reconstruction Authority, Nepal</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>275FA129-46E9-41E6-8D3C-F3A8C8344DA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enhanced guidance for community hazard assessment teams involved in surveying 500 earthquake-affected communities, in preparation for post-earthquake reconstruction</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2a2c02428d5.60746394</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of landslides triggered by the 25 April and 12 May 2015 Gorkha earthquake sequence in Nepal.
