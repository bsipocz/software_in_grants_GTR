Management Framework for Substandard Buildings in Turkey</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/P010016/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>As a consequence of population growth and urbanisation, our exposure to the seismic hazard is increasing, with the greatest risk arising from substandard constructions. Substandard reinforced concrete (RC) structures account for a large proportion of the existing building stock in urban and suburban regions of Turkey. Such structures are known to be highly vulnerable and have experienced catastrophic damage during past earthquakes (Kocaeli 1999, Duzce 1999, and Van 2011) leading to inexcusably extensive human, economic and societal losses given that the Turkish Seismic Design Code (1997) was revised in 2007 to introduce more stringent requirements for seismic design and mitigate vulnerability. However, the benefits of modern codes and more stringent code enforcement and inspection during design and construction will only benefit society in the future, whilst the current stock remains highly vulnerable. Consequently, there is an urgent need for reliable vulnerability assessments, appropriate seismic risk management strategies and fast rapid post-disaster response to significantly reduce potential losses in future severe earthquakes.
The aim of this collaboration is to synergise complementary expertise of leading institutions in Turkey and the UK in the field of Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Risk Assessment and Crisis Management so as to develop, an innovative, integrated and efficient framework for multi-hazard seismic risk assessment and disaster mitigation in Turkey. Rapid earthquake risk assessment and post-earthquake disaster intelligence obtained from real-time data from smart devices will be coupled for the first time. This synergy will contribute to the coordination of post-earthquake search and rescue actions, enhance situational awareness and to validate earthquake risk assessment predictions.
A new methodology for rapid assessment of structures will be created considering all components of primary/secondary earthquake hazards (e.g. landslides and liquefaction), structural vulnerability and financial/economic aspects. A previously developed comprehensive rapid risk assessment framework for substandard buildings will be used to provide a benchmark for calibration and optimisation of the developed framework. Pre/post-earthquake inventory data collected from substandard buildings in Turkey (region of Marmara) and high-quality seismological information from in-field measurements will be used in the calibration/optimisation process. 

The project will also address communication and knowledge modelling for crisis management, thus ensuring an efficient use of the data obtained from the high-level earthquake risk assessment. An innovative approach will be used to combine field/experimental observations and real-time data from mobile devices and advanced apps widely used for social networking. Such real-time data will be used to further calibrate the developed framework, to coordinate search/rescue actions and to increase situational awareness around the crisis. The use of social media data analysis for post-crisis management of stress, trauma and recovery will help create a more resilience society in Turkey. 

The new framework will be used to provide optimal mitigation strategies to reduce economic losses and manage the social impacts of earthquakes in Turkey, and the framework can be extended to the rest of the world.Recommendations for social/disaster management and efficient communication of risk mitigation strategies will be provided to people/government before severe earthquakes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Turkish society, insurance industry, consultants, contractors, engineers, practitioners and governmental agencies are the most likely non-academic beneficiaries of the proposed research. The outcomes of the proposed project will benefit Turkish society through reducing damage to buildings, which leads to long-term economic stability and a safer environment for poor communities living in the vicinity of developing zones of metropolitan cities. By reducing seismic risk and providing better crisis management systems, a more resilient society will be created. This research will also provide advice to the public and connect them with the responsible authorities for controlling/managing earthquake hazards and post-earthquake crisis.
The developed framework will provide efficient risk evaluation tools for decision-makers, government, insurance industry and practitioners to reduce earthquake-related losses and promote sustainable development in Turkey. However, the framework can be easily extended to other seismic regions. The high-level rapid risk assessment framework will provide valuable information for decision-makers to prioritise and optimise options for disaster/risk mitigation. Post-earthquake disaster management tools will provide valuable real-time information about different failure modes of buildings following to an earthquake that cannot be obtained by post-earthquake field visits. This information will be used as feedback for the developed rapid risk assessment framework. 
The provision of post-earthquake disaster management tools will empower both communities and emergency services to communicate and inform one another bringing about enhanced situational awareness for crisis management. This will improve the emergency services, post-earthquake disaster management and the coordination of search and rescue actions resulting in an improved crisis response benefitting the communities who are affected by the earthquake and increasing their resilience. The disaster management tools can also assist emergency services in the management of other crisis situations.
The lead institutions collaborating in this project have strong reputation for working with international teams to maximise their research impact. The positional impacts of the proposed project in the short (3 years) and long (15 years) terms are focused on four main areas:

Society: Improve the overall quality of lives of poor populations by ensuring more resilient buildings where people can work and live safely.
-Short term (ST): Better protection for low income people living in the vicinity of developing zones of metropolitan cities due to reduced risk of primary and secondary hazards occurring as a result of an earthquake. New research and risk assessment jobs in government and insurance institution will be created. Therefore, unemployment rate will fall.
-Long term (LT): Safer environment and job stability, resulting in lower crime rates.

Economy: Contribute to competitiveness, economic development and social welfare of Turkey by providing improved tools for high-level seismic risk assessment to reduce future potential damage and losses during strong earthquakes.
-ST: The creation of new jobs will provide excellent employment and training opportunities in Turkey.
-LT: Growth and economic stability though more resilient cities.

Knowledge: Improve knowledge in the field of rapid seismic risk assessment and mitigation for buildings and post disaster crisis management.
-ST: Accuracy and reliability of rapid risk assessment methods will be enhanced.
-LT: Novel methodologies will be created and transferred to other areas and countries.

People: Enable training of next generation of researchers and engineers in the field of seismic risk and crises management:
-ST: PDRA and postgraduate students will be trained in the UK and Turkish institutions.
-LT: A centre of excellence in Seismic Risk Assessment and Management will be established in Turkey.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Middle East Technical University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Turkey, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Middle East Technical University-Asst.Prof. Tugce Sevil Yaman</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD17DCF0-4D8D-4069-BC76-0B6A2434CAF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration has recently started</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c951d0109a81.45999739-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>UoS and Prof Sevil Yaman are working on a joint Newton Fund Mobility Grant application (UoS is the host institution)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>UoS and Prof Sevil Yaman have started working on a project in the field of earthquake risk assessment and management</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Delivery of a Basic Training Course on Earthquake Engineering (Sheffield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2043544-63D8-42B3-9380-FB87209B8D04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduction
Have you ever wondered why earthquakes happen or why buildings collapse during earthquakes? Do you know that globally there are over 70,000 fatalities per year due to earthquake-induced disasters? Earthquakes can devastate communities and local economies, as happened recently in Nepal.
Sheffield volunteers are actively contributing to the post-earthquake relief efforts and supporting schools in Nepal. A field mission, led by Birkdale School, is planned for 2017.
The Earth is a dynamic and a continually evolving system. We cannot predict earthquakes, so the best way to mitigate future losses is to raise awareness of the underlying risks and learn how to minimise them. 
The Concrete &amp;amp; Earthquake Engineering (CEE) group at The University of Sheffield has been working on innovative seismic strengthening techniques and risk management studies for over 20 years.

Aim of the course 
This course will provide a basic knowledge of the fundamental principles of seismic hazard and risk mitigation strategies and provide practical training on the strengthening of small buildings in preparation for a field mission to Nepal.

Course structure
The course will run from October 2016 to March 2017 and will be delivered as a series of two-hour evening seminars. Participants will learn about earthquake-related risks, their social and economic impact and risk mitigation strategies.
The last session of the course will consist of hands-on laboratory training in seismic strengthening of small concrete structures. The seminars will be delivered by international experts from the CEE group and guest speakers.

Who should attend?
The course is open to secondary education students, parents and the general public interested in learning about earthquakes and risk mitigation strategies.

Average attendance was around 100-120 people per session.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c94d97259af1.83473771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://cee.sheffield.ac.uk/events/basic-training-course-earthquake-engineering-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>43200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Newton Fund Researcher Links Workshop on &amp;quot; Seismic Loss, Rehabilitation and Post-earthquake Crisis Management of Critical Infrastructure&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RLWK6 - 261878918</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C30079A6-1F35-4797-9CEA-8B8F90914D98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8229f6b6ba0.70803418</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The initial findings of the project are having a tangible positive impact in the cultural, societal and educational areas, both at the local and international levels. For instance, at the local level, the initial findings of this study helped delivering a Basic Training Course on Earthquake Engineering for a non-specialist audience at the UoS (Oct 2016-March 2017). Participants learnt about earthquake-related risks, their social and economic impact, risk mitigation strategies. The contribution from SHU created awareness of the use of new technologies and crowd-sourcing in the field of earthquake engineering.

As part of the course, the general public and Sheffield volunteers from a local school (Birkdale) also received training in seismic strengthening techniques of small concrete structures. This prepared the volunteers for an international field mission (March-April 2017) to damaged areas in Nepal. The volunteers are expected to transfer knowledge to locals and raise awareness of seismic mitigation strategies. The volunteers will also collect data in the following research priorities to understand risk in developing countries: Use of Traditional Materials, Strengthening Techniques, Architectural Aspects, Socio-Economic Effects, Rapid Assessment. Volunteers feedback is expected in May 2017. The information will be used for research and undergrad/postgrad teaching at UoS and SHU so as to improve construction practices in the developing world.

Regarding personal development and education, both UK and Turkish institutions have started training joint PhD and MSc students in the field of earthquake risk assessment and management, which will provide excellent employment and training opportunities for Turkish young researchers.

The development of the new earthquake risk assessment and management framework in this project will enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the current risk assessment methodologies in Tukey. This will directly contribute to the economic development and social welfare of Turkey as insurance/reinsurance companies will have reliable data that can potentially reduce the cost of premiums, in turn benefiting the general population.

The dissemination website of the project (https://reraturkey.wordpress.com/) holds public information of the project that could be freely available such as project outline, project partners, press releases, online discussion forums, and information on forthcoming events.

Finally, the main hindrance to achieve impact is the lack of funding and funding cuts for the Turkish partners of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>41AC093C-8978-4FE2-87D6-9E8AC3986004</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c6dc1666e875.68753821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings related to project objectives:

Obj1. Enhancing the GTU rapid assessment tools. GTU has started modifying the modules of their rapid assessment tools to accommodate the new ERA developed in the project.

Obj2. Classify the building stock in Marmara region. ITU has started classifying the different types of substandard buildings in Marmara and creating a database for future use in vulnerability studies (Obj3).

Obj3. Develop vulnerability relationships for key substandard building classes. UoS and ITU have started a review of existing vulnerability relationships for substandard buildings and possible ways to update them with field observations. Such curves will be used later by the team to assess risk for different types of structures.

Obj4. Apply the probabilistic ERA framework for the region of Marmara. The framework has been successfully applied and software was developed to automatize the calculations. This includes Monte-Carlo sampling, randomization of parameters, and calculation of Peak Ground Accelerations at the administrative regions of Marmara. UoS will use this information (plus data vulnerability) to assess seismic risk for selected areas of Marmara for different earthquake scenarios (Obj14).

Obj7 &amp;amp; 9. Develop vulnerability mitigation strategies based in seismic retrofit / Validate selected strengthening solutions. UoS and ITU are assessing the most promising strengthening solutions. These are expected to be used later by UoS/ITU to develop new vulnerability curves for strengthened buildings so as to develop optimal mitigation strategies (Obj8).

Obj11. Develop a Mobile Application for Earthquake Management. SHU has started creating modules for the mobile application. SHU and GTU will use the app to feed in and enhance rapid assessment tools for earthquake losses (Obj1).

Current challenges &amp;amp; impact on project:

The Turkish partners informed that due to the state-of-emergency in Turkey (after the attempted coup d'etat on 15 July 2016), the Turkish government has concerns about sharing information with institutions outside Turkey. This has affected the amount and quality of data/information that UoS and SHU can receive. Moreover, although the grant started on 01 August 2016, our Turkish partners have just received the project agreement (mid-March 2017) but with a significant reduction of 30% of the requested funding. This +7-month delay and the cuts in the requested funding is causing problems with deadlines/deliverables of our project and therefore some of the objectives have not been met yet.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this project can be used by others in the near future, for instance:

- The databank of classified building stock and corresponding vulnerability curves for Marmara region can be used by other researchers and academics for further (more refined) risk assessment studies.

- The validated strengthening techniques and optimal mitigation strategies can be included in future revisions of the Turkish code.

- The probabilistic ERA framework for the region of Marmara can be potentially used by Turkish engineers to compare and update the current seismic hazard map included in the Turkish design code.

- The mobile app to collect crowd-sourced data will be freely available to the general public, eyewitness, rescue workers, structural engineers and other personnel on the ground. The gathered information will provide a significant level of real-time situational awareness to those coordinating the emergency/rescue actions. This information will include reports of what is happening, number or location of casualties, severity of structural damage (through photos/videos) so as to direct relief to the most needed areas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B7DC969F-EE57-4F22-8A38-BB70481A9E9A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6dcb1009038.06714973</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09D23DDE-1BA3-47D2-B875-A9B337103B6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis of substandard RC buildings strengthened with an innovative post-tensioned metal strapping technique</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4869415e931fe58fc13b71600f9899a"><gtr:id>b4869415e931fe58fc13b71600f9899a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garcia R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c94f77b82b98.08709451</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23FE3D12-3CDE-4810-802B-97F1DFA7FF06</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Situational Awareness Framework for Improving Earthquake Response, Recovery and Resilience</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2169fa149904b5fc39a142a3bbee11f4"><gtr:id>2169fa149904b5fc39a142a3bbee11f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gibson, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5811d2eab732e5.87700473</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P010016/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5AAD42DB-C6CB-4B09-8555-8ECA565B6B59</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ground Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>153EEBDB-0E76-4210-9687-2E4C43AE8DFF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
