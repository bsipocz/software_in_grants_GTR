We offer extensive expertise in characterisation, and access to characterisation equipment which is not widely available, identifying the most suitable characterisation techniques for the user's materials, and giving training and support in taking the measurements. We also guide users in the interpretation of the information obtained. 

FENAC's Steering Committee recently reviewed the facility's scope and future direction, and concluded that there is a wider need for nanomaterial laboratory characterisation and nanoscale process assessment, both in academia and industry, which is not covered by FENAC funding. The skills and equipment are available within the facility and there is spare capacity on the equipment. Stakeholders, including the FENAC Director and Manager, FENAC Steering Committee members, NERC, and University of Birmingham (School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science) are all in support of rolling out a commercial wing of FENAC. We also have the support of the European Biotechnology Network. 

FENAC could provide support to academics working in biosciences, environmental science and earth science, as well as a number of sectors of UK industry: nanotechnology; the environmental sector; mining; the water/wastewater industry sector.

This Pathfinder project will allow the FENAC team to fully explore the market potential of the facility as a commercially sustainable business unit. We do not have the expertise in house to undertake such an exercise so we will be appointing a specialist consultant who will provide us with the information needed to develop a full Business Case. To ensure we are the 'first choice' provider for the relevant sector and can meet the challenges of our users, the consultant will identify:
-Who our market is; 
-What that market could be worth; 
-Where competition lies;
-What the FENAC offer should be, at what price. 
The consultant will provide reliable indication of the revenue / timescales needed to move FENAC onto a commercially sustainable footing. They will also develop a marketing strategy to be delivered by the FENAC team once they have undertaken specific skills training in this area.

Through the provision of a service encompassing nanoscale characterisation and problem-solving, FENAC will be a key player in the transfer of both knowledge and technical capability into the private sector - supporting R&amp;amp;D for industry both large and small, and positioning the facility as a 'centre of excellence'. We would expect in due course to generate both income from the private and academic sectors, and benefits for industry and the environment in the UK, exceeding the initial NERC funding, and demonstrating the value of Research Council investment in this area.

At the completion of this project we will have developed a good understanding of the potential market, the customer base, and the marketing required to engage with clients. This will form the background to an application for Follow-on funding in support of the business in the initial stages of its development.

Stakeholders: FENAC Director and Manager, FENAC Steering Committee members, NERC, University of Birmingham business development offices and the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Science; potential clients within industry, academia and environmental sectors, DEFRA, Environment Agency, environmental NGOs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At the point at which we make an application for Follow-on Funding, our Pathfinder project will have already demonstrated the market potential for a commercially sustainable extension to the remit of the FENAC facility. We will have satisfactorily addressed the issues around the strengths and weaknesses of our proposal, assessed the market value of our target clientele, and have a marketing plan, and outline business plan in place. We will then require support for the execution of our plan to expand our remit from our existing model of fully-funded by NERC, to a twin facility, comprising an academic and a commercial branch.

Follow-on funding is essential to support initial marketing of the new business, and ensure dedicated staff to provide a quick and professional response to customers in the initial stages of growth, when the income would not cover the full cost of the enterprise. This support for additional staff at the preliminary stages of the business would be absolutely crucial, because industry will require a rapid and effective service, and it is not possible to provide this within current FENAC resources as there is currently no spare capacity, in terms of manpower, to take on additional work.

The establishment of a commercial wing to FENAC would have an impact in a number of different areas. Academic clients who need data at short notice could benefit from time at FENAC for characterisation work. Those with access to FENAC for a limited number of samples could pay for additional work to complete a large dataset.

FENAC support can have an impact on a number of sectors of UK industry, with wider implications for the public and the regulators: 
-The nanotechnology industry in the UK is an immature sector, dominated by SMEs who cannot afford R&amp;amp;D into the safety of their materials. By providing reliable data, and interpretation for an environmental context, activities undertaken at FENAC will not only help individual companies but the entire sector, by contributing to a reduction of the perceptions of risk around the use of nanomaterials by industry, regulators and the public.
-The environmental sector has applications relevant to nanotech waste and includes remediation using nanomaterials, e.g. nano zero-valent iron. 
-In mining, nanoscale processes are increasingly relevant to both ore extraction and post-extraction remediation.
-Water/wastewater industry sector may need support in looking at, for example, nanomaterials in domestic wastewater or nanofiltration in water-purification. 

The work with industry will further the knowledge base in academia, extending the range of publications in real-life situations, and enhance the reputation of the facility, the university and NERC in addressing industrial needs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P01366X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A600D1CC-E752-4522-95BC-916168B6C71B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Waste Minimisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>99C0726F-47B0-4500-8B73-4DD0C60E31DF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Water Quality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
