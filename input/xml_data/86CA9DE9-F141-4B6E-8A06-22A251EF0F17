But, these trials are often inconclusive leaving uncertainty about the value of the treatments tested. Over the past 30 years, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists? Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), coordinated by the MRC PHRU in Oxford, have gathered together and analysed individual patient data from hundreds of trials worldwide. These EBCTCG ?meta-analyses? have identified a number of survival improvements that were not apparent from the individual trials, but which only emerged when the data were pooled, and have also shown which patients should and should not be treated. 
Because the EBCTCG meta-analyses provide such reliable evidence, they greatly influence worldwide treatment patterns. This has been a major contributor to the big reductions in breast cancer mortality seen over the last thirty years.
Current EBCTCG meta-analyses are looking at a number of new questions (eg ?biological? therapies such as trastuzumab, comparing different types of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, how long to give hormone treatment, benefits and risks of breast cancer screening) as well as updating and extending previous analyses. Another aim is to design and implement new, large-scale trials addressing the key uncertainties about optimal breast cancer treatment identified through the EBCTCG meta-analyses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Early Breast Cancer Trialists? Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), coordinated by PHRU, was established in 1985 and includes almost all of the research groups worldwide that undertake randomised trials of treatment for women with breast cancer. In a series of collaborative meta-analyses, the global randomised evidence on particular therapeutic questions is brought together to compare the effects of different treatments on breast cancer recurrence, survival and other major outcomes. These analyses now include data on over 700,000 women in more than 800 clinical trials in 50 countries that have assessed surgical, radiotherapeutic, cytotoxic, hormonal and other treatments.
The EBCTCG meta-analyses have demonstrated many real but moderate differences in long-term survival that were not reliably demonstrable in the separate trials (including effects on breast cancer mortality and side-effects such as second cancers and vascular events). The uniquely reliable evidence from EBCTCG?s high-profile publications, which have already attracted over 20,000 scientific citations, profoundly influence national guidelines, changing worldwide treatment patterns. The long-term survival gains identified are each only moderate, but, in combination, have been a major contributor to the striking worldwide reductions in breast cancer mortality seen over the last three decades: eg, UK breast cancer mortality at age 35-69 has been halved.
Our current programme of work involves a number of individual patient data meta-analyses addressing new questions (eg HER2-directed therapies, chemotherapy dose intensification, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, duration of endocrine therapy, more extensive radiotherapy, breast cancer screening) as well as updating follow-up data for many of the questions addressed previously to assess longer-term outcome. Another focus is the collection of additional data (eg cell proliferation measures, gene expression indices, non-fatal bone fracture, heart disease and stroke) to investigate predictors of treatment response and long-term safety. Evidence of further moderate survival gains continues to emerge from these ongoing EBCTCG meta-analyses. But, each meta-analysis is a major undertaking: typically, it takes 1-2 years to plan, collate, check and correct individual patient data from relevant trials, then another 1-2 years to perform analyses and write collaborative publications. 
EBCTCG?s meta-analyses are sometimes inconclusive, highlighting the need, and informing the design of trials to generate new evidence. Because uncertainty remained about optimal duration of tamoxifen treatment, PHRU designed the aTTom and ATLAS trials that have randomised 18,000 women between 10 and 5 years of tamoxifen, showing that 15-year breast cancer mortality is improved with 10 years of treatment. Similar uncertainties about the value of breast cancer screening underlie PHRU?s collaboration in the NHSBSP/CEU trial of additional screening (n=3,000,000 randomised now, eventual target ~6,000,000, 10 times more than in all previous trials combined). Building on our worldwide collaborative group, a further aim of our ongoing programme is to design and implement new, large-scale trials (such as aTTom and ATLAS) addressing the key uncertainties about optimal breast cancer treatment identified through the EBCTCG meta-analyses.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F14ACED-011D-4D3D-AFA1-E6B24F86045C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimating the Risks of Breast Cancer Radiotherapy: Evidence From Modern Radiation Doses to the Lungs and Heart and From Previous Randomized Trials.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/74e33b6e6c73fb34506ed6a3ffcaa967"><gtr:id>74e33b6e6c73fb34506ed6a3ffcaa967</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0732-183X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa3c371f91e0.46355534</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E0331E7B-7A5F-4054-B649-3034123D3AA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>20-Year Risks of Breast-Cancer Recurrence after Stopping Endocrine Therapy at 5 Years.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The New England journal of medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5ca035eaffebd45bbb1ea7f5ec2d0e2e"><gtr:id>5ca035eaffebd45bbb1ea7f5ec2d0e2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pan H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-4793</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa3c374af570.61441636</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A1E93248-C30F-4B7B-A795-BB892C33EE0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Long-term outcomes for neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of individual patient data from ten randomised trials</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet Oncology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c24e347a951d222b260ac94aa4746ba3"><gtr:id>c24e347a951d222b260ac94aa4746ba3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Asselain B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa3c376ff2e2.51566864</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12026/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
