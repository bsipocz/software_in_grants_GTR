In his well-known study The Jaina Path of Purification, P. S. Jaini (1979) recalls that neither 'the Sravakacaras', the medieval texts outlining the rules of conduct for the Jaina laity, 'nor the practices of Jainism give any indication that a cult of relic-worship once flourished within the tradition. No stupas housing the remains of Jaina teachers have yet been discovered'. This verdict is echoed by K. Bruhn (1993): 'There is also the issue of 'actual evidence'. There were Jaina stupa.s but they did not survive. As a consequence, the stupa became a Buddhist monument'. Apart from isolated myths and legends in canonical and medieval Jaina literature, depicting the veneration of the relics of the Jaina Tirthankaras or prophets by the gods, there is no indication of bone relic worship in early and medieval Jainism to date. \n\nAlthough Jaina doctrine rejects the worship of lifeless, acitta, material objects the applicant's fieldwork in India on the hitherto unstudied contemporary Jaina mortuary rituals furnished clear evidence for the ubiquity of bone relic stupas and relic veneration across the Jaina sectarian spectrum. British Academy funded research (Research Grant 2001 APN 3/522) produced the first documentation of two modern Jaina bone relic stupas constructed by the Terapanth Svetambara Jains. Subsequent fieldwork supported by the Central Research Fund of the University of London (Research Grant 2002/2003 AR/CRF/A) demonstrated that relic stupas are not only a feature of the anti-iconic Jaina traditions, but also of image-worshipping Murtipujaka and Digambara traditions. Hence, the initial hypothesis that the contemporary Jaina cult of bone relics functions either as substitute or as a prototype for image-worship had to be amended. Modern Jaina relic shrines are evidently not only constructed in anti-iconic Jaina traditions as functional equivalents of temples. The findings also demonstrate that the Jaina cult of relic worship is not only a feature of lay religiosity, but deliberately fostered by mendicants seeking to perpetuate their influence. \n\nThe book on Jaina Rituals of Death, emerging from the research project, will offer for the first time a comprehensive summary and interpretation of these new findings. It will also reassess the evidence for historical antecedents and the relationship of documented Jaina practices to Hindu and Buddhist customs. The only previous book-length study on Jaina stupas is Vincent Smith's (1901) account of the fragmentary research of A. F&amp;uuml;hrer, who did not leave any notes of his excavation of the Jaina stupa in Mathura. Recent ethnographic and textual studies of the popular devotional rituals held at 'commemorative' Jaina shrines by Laidlaw (1985), Granoff (1992), Humphrey and Laidlaw (1994), Babb (1996), Laughlin (2003), and Dundas (2007) demonstrated the prevalence of worshippers' orientation towards the 'magical power' of famous deceased Jaina monks who are reborn as gods. Until the present author's recent, as yet unpublished, findings there was no evidence that many of these and similar monuments are veritable relic stupas. \n\nWhy do human beings venerate relics? Broadly speaking, three theoretical approaches have been proposed in academic discourses: (1) psychological theories, (2) sociological theories, and (3) fetish theories. Most current theories tend to presuppose rather than explain the power of relics within given cultural systems. The book emerging from this research project will suggest an alternative system theoretical approach focusing on the role of relics as social catalysts. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through the dissemination of information that is of significance both to specialist researchers and to the wider public the project will contribute to the advance of knowledge and an increased insight in cultural differences and similarities. In this way it will contribute to an enhanced mutual understanding between members of different religions and cultures, and culturally sensitive government policy and legislation. \n\nThe project will have an impact both in Britain and in India and around the globe. Not only on academic and community circles but also on interfaith movements and other forums of intra- and inter-community engagement. \n\nTo assure that the research will not only benefit academic research and the advancement of knowledge in different disciplines and areas of study concerned with mortuary and relic practices across traditions and members of the Jain communities, but also users around the world with an interest in the diversity of religious beliefs and practices encountered globally and locally three forms of communication will be established: \n\n(a) a project website, \n(b) open access internet publication, and \n(c) community outreach programmes of the Centre of Jaina Studies at SOAS. \n\nOverall, the research findings will be disseminated in the following ways. \n\n1. A comprehensive monograph on 'Jaina Rituals of Death' and research papers emerging from the project will be mainly directed at a specialist academic audience and at students as well as members of the Jain communities. \n\n2. Research papers will be delivered at international conferences, such as the Jaina Panels at the Annual Conference of the American Academy of Religion and the World Sanskrit Conference. \n\n3. For both specialist and non-specialist readership brief research reports will be published in Jaina Studies - Newsletter of the Centre of Jaina Studies at SOAS, both online and in print, and a variety of Indian Newsletters. See: http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies/newsletter/\n\n4. The public understanding of science and adult education and widened relations with the Indian and more specifically Jain communities will be enhanced by dissemination of research findings at the open access international Annual Jaina Studies Workshop at SOAS which in 2011 will address issues related to the research project. \n\nThe event is organized in collaboration with institutions such as the V&amp;amp;A Museum Jaina Art Fund and the British Library in London, the Centre of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Lund, and other academic institutions, as well as by voluntary donations by users. It features in media reports online, on BBC Radio, and in other forms. It is advertised worldwide: http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies/events. \n\n5. Other forms of free dissemination of information on the project to users include the online publication of post-prints of research articles on the SOAS e-prints repository (https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/view/divisions/1500.html) and a website which will be dedicated to the project on the webpages of the CoJS: http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies. \n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74540</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Textual Paradigms and Archaeological Evidence for Jaina Relic Worship in Ancient  	India</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDF630FA-BA10-4C12-BAC3-F874566EFFDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Questions and discussions.

Although Jaina doctrine rejects the worship of lifeless material objects, fieldwork in India on the hitherto unstudied contemporary Jaina mortuary rituals furnished clear evidence for the ubiquity of bone relic st_pas and veneration of the relics of renowned monks and nuns across the Jaina sectarian spectrum. The findings demonstrate that the Jaina cult of relic worship is not only a feature of lay religiosity, but deliberately fostered by mendicants seeking to perpetuate their influence. The monograph on Jaina Rituals of Death, summarizing the outcomes of this long-term research project, offers for the first time a comprehensive overview and interpretation of these new findings in the wider context of relic practices in South Asia and across the world. The only previous book-length study on Jaina st_pas was V. Smith's (1901) account of the fragmentary research of A. F&amp;uuml;hrer, who did not leave any notes of his excavation of the Jaina st_pa in Mathura.

Before the publication of the findings of this project, there was no evidence demonstrating that many of these and similar monuments are veritable relic st_pas. 



Why do human beings venerate relics? Broadly speaking, three theoretical approaches have been proposed in academic discourses: psychological theories, sociological theories, and fetish theories. Most theories presuppose rather than explain the power of relics within given cultural systems. The publications emerging from this research project offer two new perspectives: (1) a system-theoretical explanation, focusing on the general role of relics as social catalysts; (2) analyses of the culturally specific explanations of the extraordinary material rather than metaphysical qualities of the body relics of saints. Quality and function of 'special matter' replace the 'metaphysical presence' of the special dead in their remains.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The published findings on the role of relic worship and stupa construction in contemporary Jainism should not only benefit academic research and general education but potentially also the advancement of general public understanding of religious beliefs and practices. 



Through the dissemination of new information significant both to specialist researchers and to the wider public the findings of the project contribute to the advancement of public knowledge and increased insight in cultural differences and similarities. Hopefully they will also contribute to an enhanced mutual understanding between members of different religions and cultures, and to more culturally sensitive government policies. 



The project outcomes should have an impact both in Britain, India and around the globe. They will be of use for academic and educational institutions and for members of the Jain community, interfaith initiatives and other forums of intra- and inter-community engagement, as well as for public service providers. The results will be of particular interest for members of cultural traditions where relics play a significant role, such as Christianity or Buddhism, and for members of the South Asian traditions. Museums, galleries and the international art market are users which are expected to take note of the new findings of the project. 



To assure that the research outcomes will not only benefit academic research but also interested members of the Jain communities, service providers and users around the world with an interest in religious beliefs and practices three freely accessible tools of dissemination have been created: (a) a project website, (b) open access internet publications (e-prints), and (c) ongoing outreach activities of the Centre of Jaina Studies at SOAS.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BA010775-EFA7-402B-A39D-0C54693D943A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3812390206.206953775bd134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies/research/jaina-rituals-of-death/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0ECD1AAB-C1F6-4DB7-B1CD-872422CBF753</gtr:id><gtr:title>St_pa as T_rtha: Jaina Monastic Funerary Monuments</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff02f981dc8e8c4109fcc1f1e45810bd"><gtr:id>ff02f981dc8e8c4109fcc1f1e45810bd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peter Flugel (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_390253952363c5550a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C1433C09-59CC-4E53-B05D-34887B0141DB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Die Sthanakavasi Jaina Orden in Nordindien: Protestantische Und Post-Protestantische Jaina-Reformbewegungen</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b94fd4923638bd673fc2ec66d67aac72"><gtr:id>b94fd4923638bd673fc2ec66d67aac72</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flugel, Peter (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, UK)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-447-06714-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_59672281643c09b8f2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B8EA2C6-7168-4DA1-A0A7-8E7108579139</gtr:id><gtr:title>Burial Ad Sanctos at Jaina Sites in India</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2c23da4715847909414d0e76da92ea31"><gtr:id>2c23da4715847909414d0e76da92ea31</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flugel PF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464d72a1ebe56.51994743</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A250D295-07BB-4840-B362-DEEDDFBE30F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sacred Matter: Reflections on the Relationship of Karmic and Natural Causality in Jaina Philosophy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Indian Philosophy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/93b06bbf928cc0283b6a4ce5a0575fae"><gtr:id>93b06bbf928cc0283b6a4ce5a0575fae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fl?gel P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdbfdbd9da6b6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B47441AB-0E6A-4367-ADF6-175B70881971</gtr:id><gtr:title>Jaina Rituals of Death - AHRC Funded Project at SOAS</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d1ddb6b03a356797d4c4b020219ff851"><gtr:id>d1ddb6b03a356797d4c4b020219ff851</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peter Fl?gel (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_581538558563c54894</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EBF461A-192C-4C68-8069-83ECA3A3209E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Johannes Klatt's Jaina Onomasticon</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d1ddb6b03a356797d4c4b020219ff851"><gtr:id>d1ddb6b03a356797d4c4b020219ff851</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peter Fl?gel (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_443715850263c54704</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I002405/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp;
