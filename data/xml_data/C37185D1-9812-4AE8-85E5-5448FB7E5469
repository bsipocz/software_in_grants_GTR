inorganic solar photovoltaic (PV) research programme / this proposal is for a renewal for the second four year cycle. The Consortium has sharpened its focus on the science that will deliver our medium to long term goal of 'making a major contribution to achieving competitive PV solar energy'. In its initial period of activity, the Consortium has put in place lab-scale facilities for making three main types of solar cells based on thin film absorbers - copper indium diselenide, cadmium telluride and ultra thin silicon - using a range of methods. In the renewal programme, these three 'Technology Platforms' form the basis for testing new processes and concepts. To reduce costs, we shall concentrate on critical materials and PV device issues. For large-scale PV manufacture, the materials costs dominate, and together with module efficiency determine the cost per kW peak. A closely related issue is sustainability. For example the metal indium is a key component in PV, but is rare and expensive ($660/kg in 2007). Reducing the thickness of semiconductor by one millionth of a metre (1 micron) in 10% efficient cells with a peak generating capacity of 1GW would save 50 tonnes of material. The renewal programme therefore includes work on both thickness reduction and on finding alternative sustainable low cost materials (absorbers and transparent conductors). To increase efficiency we shall work on aspects of grain boundaries and nanostructures thin films as well as on doping. Nanostructures will also be exploited to harvest more light, and surface sensitization of thin film silicon cells by energy transfer from fluorescent dyes will also be investigated as a means of making better use of sunlight and substantially reducing the required film thickness to as low 0.2 microns. In order to ensure a focus on cost effectiveness, the renewal programme includes a technical economics package that will examine cost and sustainability issues. Future links between innovative concepts and industry are ensured by a 'producibility' work package. Two highly relevant 'plus' packages have been submitted alongside the renewal proposal, these being on a) thin film silicon devices, grain engineering and new concepts, and b) new absorber materials. The Consortium will also continue to run the successful UK network for PV materials and device research, PV-NET, which is a forum for the UK academic and industrial research communities. The Supergen funding mechanism has enabled the Consortium to assemble and fully integrate a critical mass of PV researchers in the UK, and the work packages outlined in the proposal interweave the skills and capabilities of seven universities and nine industrial partners. PV-21 is also plays an important role in skills development, with nine PhD students due to be trained in the first cohort. The EPSRC Supergen funding mechanism is absolutely vital for the continued growth and strength of the UK PV materials research effort.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1806675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We established methods to make world class thin film solar cell devices in the CdTe system.

Beneficiaries: UK academic groups working on CdTe. International groups working on CdTe

Contribution Method: This has established the international credibility of the UK thin film PV research effort, which has now laid down a marker with a high efficiency result in a mainstream PV technology

Method of making CZTS solar cells.

The best performing thin film PV technology is CuInGaSe2 (&amp;gt;20%). A potential barrier to its widespread use in future is the reliance on low abundance materials (In &amp;amp; Ga) that are byeproducts and produced in relatively small quantities. Northumbria identified early work in Japan and Germany on CZTS and developed this with the University of Bath. Northumbria used method in which metal layers were deposited by a vacuum process known as sputtering. These were then heated in selenium and or sulphur to produce the semiconducting layer that aborbs light. Making solar cells from this material resulted in a world's best performance. This idea and techique has now stimulated many other groups to try to duplicate the technique and this was given a much greater urgency after IBM had seen our use of selenium and used it with their nonoparticle sulphide films to produce a device with an efficiency of nearly 10% - a value that is important for future commercial production.

Beneficiaries: Northumbria University has benefited, is now a partner in the KESTCELLS Marie Curie ITN. PV21, other UK and European collaborators, have chosen to duplicate the 2-stage Northumbria route rather than IBM's record breaking non-vacuum path. The UK science base is enhanced, its PV community - stimulated and seen as competitive. It has led to submission of2 UK EPSRC proposals; researchers and UK collaborators (Strathclyde University) establishing expertise and journal/conference publications.

Contribution Method: The record CZTSe cell performance provided IBM with the idea to use selenium and annealing that helped produce a record CZTS,Se cell.

Production of sulphide absorber materials based on Cu-Sb and Cu-Bi was acheved by sputtering Cu-Bi or Cu-Sb metal layers and heating them in sulphur. Hese were then made into the first Cu3SbS3 cells.

Starting from thin film technologies that use indium and gallium and then identifying alternative abundant materials was a key part of PV21. Both bismuth (Bi) and antimony (Sb) are produced in much grater quantities than In and Ga. These materials were combined with copper and then heated in sulpur. Northumbria made material by vacuum processing whereas Bath University use non-vacuum wet processes to make the material and Cranfield - Shrivenham developed special techniques to find out about how the mixing of the elements changed the materials behavoiur. Northumbria produced the first working solar cell from Cu3SbS3. The impact of this together with the use of selenium /sulphur ratio to tailor properties, provides further opportunity for develpoment of new and sustainable pv technologies.

Beneficiaries: Northumbria University has benefited from establishing a device based on Cu3Sb(SeS)3 . Collaborators within and outside the PV21 consortium (Strathclyde University) have investigated the optical properties of this material, broadening their understanding of this materials family has led to work due to be published and the submission of a research proposal on the fundamental properties of new materials. The UK science base is also enhanced and a PhD student has established new expertise.

Contribution Method: This has brodened and deepened the understanding of this family of sulphur-selenisdes of abundant materials. As a consequence the reseach capability has been enhanced and the UK Science base developed.

A development of a system established at NREL in the US to characterise the electrical properties of PV and other materials.

The system measures fundamental electrical properties of transparent conductors and absorber layer PV materials. It is a joint development with a UK SME, SemiMetrics Ltd. This will both help Northumbria's and the UK's reseach base and also establish SemiMetrics Ltd as maker of this and related systems in future. Interest from Pilkington/NSG and other UK and EU universities.

Beneficiaries: Northumbria University will benefit from this unique characterisation tool with possible application for characterisation of a range of electronic and semiconducting materials. The research enabled a combined development with an SME, SemiMetrics Ltd and software engineer that provides opportunity for commercial exploitation in future.

Contribution Method: The ressearch and development of the 4C system has provided a deeper understanding of the roll of molybdenum doping of indium oxide in the high performance indium molybdenum oxide transparent conducting oxide. The development of this system has also begun to identify parameters within absorber materials that will be valuable in optimising these materials for solar cells.

Solar Photovoltaics: The challenges and potential for research into a sustainable future.

Invited talk at a UK-Brazil, Workshop on Physics and Chemistry of Climate Change, on Solar PV related challenges and opportunities for the Future.

Beneficiaries: Adacdemics from Brazil and the UK, students, Brazil - UK scientific interaction and the UK-Brazil year of science. The meeting was reported in the Brazillian media and some exchange of data has been achieved - contacts made for future reference. Local businesses in the North East of England were provided as examples of new PV related business opportunities (Romag and NaREC were given).

Contribution Method: The research provided a focus and underpinning scientific depth that enabled the talk to both inform the audience about the subject, highlight the activities and capabilities available at Nothumbria, its PV21 partners.

Thin Film Photovoltaics.

Invited talk on the thin film PV at Solar Flair 10, Lumley Castle, Co Durham.

Beneficiaries: Those attendees at the Solar Flair10 that were interested in PV developments, future technologies and research in the UK. Local government, industry, SME and academics.

Contribution Method: The research supported the theme of sustainability for future solar markets and helped make the case for and demonstrate the results of, research into PV tecnologies that is being undertaken in North East England as part of a successful national programme.

Materials sustainability: Thin film photovoltaics in a terrawatt solar electricity market.

Invited talk on the sustainability of PV materials in the context of predicted future electricity markets.

Beneficiaries: Members of the Materials community and industry gained an insight into

Contribution Method: The research supported the theme of sustainability for future solar markets. It provided current and practical UK examples of research progress into devices based on sustainable thin film PV materials as an example of alternatives to the current generation of technologies and the potential problems with these.

We developed a way to grow the NWs and make core-shell devices from them that is compatible with future PV devices. We demonstrated 2.5% for a lab device.

Beneficiaries: Academic groups working on II-VI nanowires worldwide. E.g. Ioffe Institute, St Petersburg

Contribution Method: Demonstrated a new method for CdTe NW growth. Provided experimental data for modellers. Opens up a new way to make nano solar cells

A new method was developed to establish the extent of the deleterious electrical activity of grain boundaries. It was applied to CZTS and it was found that secondary phases in CZTS help passivate the grain boundaries.

Beneficiaries: UK and international research groups working on CZTS solar cells

Contribution Method: This opens up a new strand of research in a burgeoning new area of PV

Increased doping in CdTe thin films: the upper limit to doping caps the efficiency of solar cells made from CdTe. We did a basic study of surface chemistry that lead to a way to increase the doping limit beyond the state of the art. It increased the performance of the devices.

Beneficiaries: Academic groups working on CdTe solar cells. Possibly industrial groups, but they may not disseminate

Contribution Method: The basic study allowed the performance of solar cells to be increased

We developed a new way to increase the grain size in CdTe thin films and thereby to increase the efficiency of solar cells. The patent was sold to Abound Solar.

Beneficiaries: The authors, Abound Solar

Contribution Method: A fundamental study generated the method to increase the grain size.

Beneficiaries: PV thin film industry generally plus academic labs

Contribution Method: Indium and tellurium scarcity has increasingly become a concern within the PV sector both in terms of absolute availability of the materials to support future market expansion of CIGS and CdTe technologies and of impact of materials prices increases on their cost reduction ambitions. This work provides detailed insights and analysis on both these aspects and it has raised considerable interest from both PV industry and academic representatives.

Application of photosynthetic light harvesting via nonradiative energy transfer between a molecule and semiconductor to enhance the photoexcitation of silicon.

Beneficiaries: Academic community

State of the art materials limit the performance of PV devices. We developed a new material that overcomes these limits.

Beneficiaries: University of Liverpool research team

Contribution Method: We identified a method to increase the window layer performance of solar cells

We used modelling to determine that the layer thicknesses in some PV devices could be tuned to increase the efficincy of solar cells by about 1/5th.

Beneficiaries: UK academic groups making solar cells

Contribution Method: This has become a major strand in the new UK SUPERGEN PV Hub

Significant advances in the understanding of light capture in solar cells.

Beneficiaries: Academic communityDevelopment of an non-contact fast imaging system.

This system was also developed with SemiMetrics as part of the Mid-term project of PV21. It is unique in the UK and enables rapid assessment of light emitted from the absorber layers following stimulation of electrons by either light or electricity. Offers a method for assessing the optical quality and conversion performance of materials and the identification of poor quality regions.

Beneficiaries: Northumbria university has a unique characterisation tool with possible apllication to production. The first version has demonstrated a capability of assessing both as produced absorber layers and completed cells. Successfully further development will enable Northumbria and Semimetrics Ltd will provide a valuable rapid characterisation of materials quality. This will help the UK science base and have commercial/environmental benefits for PV industry if used for minimisation of production waste.

Contribution Method: The results of photoluminescence have demonstrated that a rapid characterisation technique can be used to identify key materials parameters - relevant to solar cell optimisation. Further work is required to fully assess the benefits that this technique will provide in future.

Significant advances in understanding and methedology of low temperature Si nanowire growth using a catalyst which does not degrade device properties.

Beneficiaries: Academic community plus potential benefits to sectors listed

Use of S/Se ratios to cntrol the semiconductor electronic bandgap to tune the absorption to match the solar spectrum.

When copper is mixed with zinc and tin or with antimony or bismuth and then made into a semiconductor by heating with sulphur or selenium. The semiconductor aborbs light and if a solar cell is made from the material then electricity can be generated by this absorption. If sulpur is used then light with shorter wavelengths (green-blue) is absorbed whereas if selenium is used then longer wavelength (red) light is absorbed. Therefore the colour of light absorbed can be controlled by using different amounts of sulphur and selenium. Northumbria heated with different ratios of sulphur to selenium to demonstrate and control the absorption of light, in three different materials systems.

Beneficiaries: Northubria University has established, a capability and understanding of engineering pv materials, collaborative working relationships with institutions in the UK and via these to intistutions in Europe including Belarus and Estonia. Conference/journal publications and proposal submissions

Contribution Method: Use of sulphur-selenium ratios to control and engineer the properties has highlighted a route to tailor and optimise output of solar cells that use these copper based materials. This mechanism may provide a valuable tool to maximise energy yield from PV systems should they be based on such thin film technologies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Wide ranging development of new materials and processes that have the potential to create important new solar electricity generating devices</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>05C08125-E93A-4A22-B949-BEF53DBCFDEF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddfdc7ba4f86.56762035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7E02C2B-B388-424D-963C-92C1F2375DB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of secondary phase precipitation on grain boundary electrical activity in Cu
