The two most important consequences deduced from epidemiological studies are failure to produce sufficient blood cells and the development of certain leukaemias. Throughout life we are continuously exposed to low doses of radiation from natural sources (e.g. radon) and for most of us, our lifetime exposure is increased by low doses from man-made sources; these are principally medical procedures, but in some cases exposures at work and potentially from nuclear industrial processes. The health effects attributed to these types of exposures are far from understood.||The aim of the project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in determining how the haemopoietic system and other related mouse and human cell types respond to irradiation and to investigate how these responses are modified by genetic and other factors (such as radiation type and dose). The research builds on our discovery of radiation-induced GI, an effect that can be induced at very low doses and results in a long-lived increase in the rate at which mutations arise in cells.||</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aims of the research are to determine and characterise the factors influencing the induction and expression of genomic instability (GI) in irradiated and bystander populations (cell type, radiation quality and genotype); to study the relationship between responses in these two populations, including possible underlying mechanisms, and to identify practical health and risk implications (e.g. initiation and progression of cancer; environmental, occupational and medical risks of radiation exposure).||The main objectives are to investigate the influence of radiation quality and genotype on the induction and expression of GI by:||- Investigating the basic mechanisms underlying the induction of GI by ionizing radiation by quantifying the effect at low doses using different radiation qualities, and by extending some of our initial studies that have demonstrated an effect of certain cytokines by using the SELDI-TOF apparatus. ||- Investigating the mechanisms contributing to genetic variation in susceptibility to GI and the influence of different cell types, including primary human lymphocytes and murine neuronal cells. ||- Examining the relationship between the early and delayed responses in irradiated and bystander cells, and the associated mechanisms, using novel dish systems and extensive comparisons of endpoints (e.g.. chromosomal aberrations).||- Investigating the potential for an extra-nuclear target and the production of clastogenic factors (the involvement of microenvironment and sub-cellular organelles) in bystander effects.||Primarily using cells derived from the haematopoetic system, we will continue to use alpha-particle, conventional x-ray and ultra-soft x-ray irradiations to understand the role of radiation quality in the initiation of GI and bystander effects. ||We will assess clonogenic survival, delayed cytogenetic aberrations and induction of apoptosis using established techniques, in addition to novel molecular techniques, such as M-FISH, Comet assay, ELISA and antibodies against proteins associated with double strand breaks (e.g. -H2AX, 53BP1). Further, comparable studies will be carried out using other cell systems to more fully characterize these responses (GI and bystander effects). ||The research has implications for mechanistic understanding of the cancer predisposition in human chromosomal instability syndromes, as it involves extensive chromosomal analysis under radiation conditions that generate an instability phenotype reminiscent of that observed in chromosomal instability syndromes. ||The research also has implications for radiation risk and the pathogenesis of radiogenic malignancies with the associated potential for diagnostic and therapeutic developments, especially as some of the exposure regimens are similar to the clinical and environmental exposure situation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1999-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>456392</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U142784379</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
