Scientists, economists and other researchers engaged in forecasting the future regularly use probabilistic techniques to manage the massive uncertainties they face in estimating future values of parameters such as global temperature or human population. Rather than trying to guess the exact value of the variable they are interested in, they tend to think in terms of 'probability distributions' over ranges of possible values. In effect, they draw on the power of modern computing to model all possible futures in order to see how frequently different outcomes occur, rather than trying to model a single 'best estimate' scenario.

Probabilistic estimation of uncertain variables was pioneered in the field of nuclear safety in the 1970s and has since become a workhorse of the natural and social sciences. Decades of experience have refined both the theory that underpins it and the methods for implementing it. Probabilistic models are not infallible, but they capitalise on the power of computing and offer a balance of pragmatism and rigour that makes them far superior to the deterministic 'best estimate' models they displaced. The probabilistic approach is now de rigeur in fields as diverse as economics, meteorology and radiation oncology. Yet it has never been developed as a tool of historical analysis, although many quantitative problems in history share deep structural similarities with the problems where probabilistic approaches are deployed in other fields (most importantly: the presence of multiple independent sources of uncertainty). 

This Fellowship aims to demonstrate their potential as tools of historical analysis and to work towards disseminating the knowledge and skills needed to use them to other pre-modern historians. The potential reward is an improvement in the quality of our knowledge about many obscure historical parameters. In some cases this will involve generating robust estimates for parameters that have seemed unquantifiable given the current evidence base; in others it will involve unsettling established hypotheses that obfuscate the full extent of uncertainty.

The Fellowship will produce (i) studies of three long-standing problems in ancient history, to illustrate the method and its potentially wide application, (ii) a workshop to disseminate and refine the methodology in collaboration with other early-career researchers, (iii) a conference to stimulate wider reflection on the methods we use to think about uncertainty in the past and (iv) a book show-casing the state of the art in, and new approaches to, parametric modellin in ancient history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The essence of this project - borrowing an unfamiliar, analytically powerful and yet disarmingly simple idea from the sciences and redeploying it to long-standing problems in ancient history - makes for an exciting illustration of the vibrancy of humanities research and the value of interdisciplinarity. 

The application of probabilistic methods normally used to forecast the future to uncertainty about the past also raises profound and fascinating questions about the nature of uncertainty and historical knowledge. Their relevance extends beyond academic historian, particularly since they resonate with growing interest in the problem of how uncertainty is understood and managed in the light of the recent financial crisis.

I will use tailored internet resources to encourage the interested public to reflect on the nature of uncertainty, in both the past and the future, and the tools we use to manage it. I hope to show that the problems faced by ancient historians and my solutions to them intersect in surprising but enlightening ways with numerous topical issues that centre on uncertainty. Although it is impossible to predict what might be topical at the time of the Fellowship, ongoing issues that continue to generate heated debate include: the use of probabilistic models to measure financial institutions' exposure to risk, the best way to represent our imperfect knowledge about the trajectory of global temperatures over the next century and the ways in which medical and other scientific knowledge is distorted by the procedures that determine which studies are worthy of being published. The conceptual problems at the heart of all these issues can be both illustrated by, and used to reflect on, thinking about the nature of uncertainty about the historical problems I am working on.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150879</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P004571/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
