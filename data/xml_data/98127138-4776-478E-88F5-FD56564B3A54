Who will benefit from this research?
IBCarb will bring together a multi-disciplinary, academia-industry network to review and address the outstanding Glycoscience challenges of the day. Activities will be of direct relevance to:
*Industries associated with Health; Renewable Materials, Chemicals and Energy; Food. 
*Academics interested in carbohydrates in general, structural analysis, synthesis, biotransformations and materials more specifically.
*National and international Governments and policy makers involved in sustainable development and environmental impact.
*Public sector entities, such as schools, looking to raise awareness of diet-health, renewable chemicals and biodegradable materials.
*The wider public, with a general miss-guided perception that &amp;quot;sugars are bad for you&amp;quot;.

. How will they benefit from this research?
*Awareness of glycoscience opportunities will be raised with industry, presenting new opportunities for: biomarker discovery, biopharmaceutical quality control and drug targeting; biomass conversion and the generation of novel functional biopolymers, platform chemicals and energy supplies; development of novel prebiotic sugars to control gut microbiota, low calorie natural sweeteners and designer polysaccharides with functional food potential. As such, glycoscience presents new market opportunities.
*Academia will benefit from new opportunities to up-skill in carbohydrate chemistry and biology, increased academia-industry engagement, and access to seed corn funds to establish new interdisciplinary research and development programmes, and to develop preliminary data for larger applications. 
*Through the proposed IBCarb Roadmap, National and international Governments and policy makers will be better aware of the opportunities that glycotools and sustainable carbohydrate biomass feedstocks have to underpin the health, chemicals, energy and food sectors. 
*Outreach activities will increase awareness amongst school pupils and the public at large about the many and varied applications and benefits of carbohydrates. More directly they will benefit from improved technologies and products arising from (e.g. diagnostics, nutraceuticals, alternatives to antibiotics, biodegradable plastics, cleaner energy).

.What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?
IBCarb will hold annual meetings with international lecturers and extensive poster sessions. Satellite activities will include: sandpits, mentoring for PhD/postdoc projects, open forum discussion on glycobiotechnology challenges, scientific speed-dating for academics and industrialists. Newsletters and a website will provide links to resources, eg on-line tools in the social media and 'You-Tube' videos to bring glycoscience to the wider community. Proof of Concept Funds will support R+D projects, which will be focussed on strategic areas of glycobiotechnology and used to work up project ideas for applications for RCUK, Horizon 2020 and IBCatalyst Funding. 
Training courses, for academia and industry, will be feature of the network, providing a basic introduction in glycotechnology through advanced hands-on and theoretical training courses, as well as providing access to specialised facilities.
A key element of IBCarb activities will be the development of a Glycoscience Roadmap, which will provide a strategic overview of the opportunities for carbohydrate IBBE. This will result in solicitation of targeted investment, the development of new technologies, processes and products, resulting is targeted investment and creating new commercial and job opportunities cross-sector. 
Building on our recent highly successful exhibit (Complex Life of Sugars) at the Royal Society Summer Exhibition 2013 (over 12,000 visitors), for outreach activities we will generate core components (experiment, films, videos) for an 'IBCarb roadshow', which will be used to promote opportunites to policy makes and the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>736704</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>IBCarb is delighted to present 'Sweet Existence' by artist Karen Barber - a vibrant, colourful collection of abstract paintings that showcase the incredibly diverse and vital roles of sugars.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7EE2B138-AE3E-439E-B9D5-5425D8012DBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sweet Existence will be showcased across the UK in a variety of locations and as part of various meetings and events.

A MOOC provides: open education, global reach, improves recruitment in emerging areas (for example glycoscience), widening participation. The MOOC contents level is aimed at students aged above 16 studying A-Levels in Science or adults with an interest in Science. However, the demographic split of students is typically 31% student/pupil, 20% curious amateur/hobbyist, 20% industry professional, 10% academic/teacher, 9% research scientist, 10% other.
 
The MOOC will be made available on Coursera https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera?static=true for free; however, if students require a verified certificate then they must complete the quizzes and pay a small fee. The course takes typically 6-8 weeks to complete and comprises of interactive video lectures, a narrative, supplementary links, self-test quizzes, forums and assignments. The glycoscience module is based on 'A Roadmap for Glycoscience in Europe' produced by IBCarb and the EGSF. It covers an introduction to glycoscience, key results and challenges in the areas of Pharmaceuticals and Personalised Medicines (addressing challenges in Health), Food (food security and wellbeing) and biomaterials (resource efficiency and raw materials). Underpinning these opportunities are a number of emerging Glycoscience Tools, particularly in synthesis, analysis, bioinformatics and modelling which open up glycoscience to a much wider scientific and industrial community and overcome barriers to entry for commercial applications. Importantly, full exploitation will only be possible, if the broader community is educated in the opportunities brought by the emerging field of glycoscience, through cooperation with the media and policy makers, as well as Education and Training for students and scientists at all levels. The course will be available online from May 2016 on Coursera.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d58e52a87994.27294331</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.mooc-list.com/initiative/coursera?static=true</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IBCarb Network: IBCarb Glycoenzymes for Bioindustries 02/04/14</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AF6FD66-70E1-4280-9CD3-BC1BC55AEBF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of key lectures were presented on carbohydrate microarrays followed by flash presentations.

The exhibition was visited by over 12,500 people including the following categories: students, teachers, public, scientists, media, potential donors/key decision makers and celebrities. The complex life of sugars webpage http://sse.royalsociety.org/2013/exhibits/sweet-complexity/ proved a great success, including one of the most popular 'how it works' videos. The webpages also include scientist profile videos for four members of the group http://sse.royalsociety.org/2013/exhibits/sweet-complexity/scientists/. The videos range from a PhD student just beginning their career all the way up to an internationally established Professor leading their field. We hope that these videos show the range of job opportunities available within an academic career (STEM subject) and also the person behind the scientist. As part of the exhibition we also commissioned a three minute animation which provides an introduction and overview of the whole area of carbohydrate science. This video has had over 700 views http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uT9dQ-s1yo in three different places (available on other websites). We were also successful in the Royal Society Games Jam competition. Our game, 'Cell Invaders' was voted the best game at the exhibition and won &amp;pound;2,000 worth of development. It is now available to download on PC http://coolcherrytrees.com/cellinvaders/web/web-new.html and ipad https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cell-invader/id664340722?mt=8. One of the main exhibition activities was focused on cell surface sugars and visitors were encouraged to build a cell surface sugar and explore its interaction with cell invaders both on a cell surface and also a gold glycan array.

Multidisciplinary teams work all summer long to build genetically engineered systems using standard biological parts called Biobricks. iGEM teams work inside and outside the lab, creating sophisticated projects that strive to create positive contribution to their communities and the world.

Manchester-Graz team developed a novel system for treating Parkinson's disease using engineered bacteria. The aim was to make the first steps in the development of a unique technology of drug delivery by developing self-regulating drug-producing bacterial strains that, in the future, could be incorporated into patients' intestinal and gut microflora to secrete medicines directly inside the patient's body in response to any physiological changes, in particular low levels of dopamine. To control the bacterial L-DOPA production, they developed an innovative multidimensional cell density dependent auto-regulation system that could also be used to control other multistep enzyme pathways.

The NRP-UEA team investigated 2 approaches towards improving butyrate levels in the gut. Colon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death with 30,000 new cases diagnosed every year in England and Wales and a registered cause of death in half that number. Recent studies have suggested that high dietary intake of resistant starch may reduce colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Resistant starches escape digestion in the small intestine and are fermented by microbiota in the colon. A small proportion of these colonic bacteria produce short chain fatty acids including butyrate, which can activate apoptosis in colon cancer cells. We are taking two approaches to improve butyrate levels in the colon. In the first we produced modified starches that might be consumed as prebiotics. In the second approach the butyrate biosynthetic pathway was transferred to culturable bacterial species with the long-term aim of producing a probiotic. They also investigated the policies and practices around nutritional intervention studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de9f72be45a8.30678002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://igem.org/Competition</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IBCarb Network Event: Glycoanalysis for Industrial Biotechnology Applications Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF59E7EB-F5D5-410A-B2DF-2DCBE290D201</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Glycans, in the form of polysaccharides or glycoconjugates, are the most abundant class of biomolecule on the planet.

Given that the IBCarb network is primarily focused on tools it is not surprising that this is area that we have had most activity and impact, especially in the analytical sciences which impacts all industrial sectors. 
This is evidenced by the number of collaborative funding applications between our members under our Tools remit (8 of 12 Business Interaction Vouchers awarded and 6 of 8 Proof of Concept projects awarded).
In addition, 2 spin-out companies have formed to capitalise on ideas formed and needs established through discussions with industry delegates at IBCarb network events.
Bio-Shape Ltd - is a contract analytical company that offers ion mobility separation coupled with mass spectrometry detection to determine the size and shape of biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Established by network members Sabine Flitsch (University of Manchester), Perdita Barran (University of Manchester), Claire Eyers (University of Liverpool) and Hannah Roberts (University of Manchester). http://bio-shape.com
Iceni Diagnostics - is a contract research company offering a rapid diagnostic testing technique using nano-gold particles employing recent discoveries in glyco-biology established by Rob Field (JIC). http://www.norwichresearchpark.com/space/parkdirectory/icenidiagnostics.aspx
Two network members are currently participating in Pitch@Palace - http://pitchatpalace.com, Hannah Roberts (Bio-Shape Ltd) and Jerry Turnbull (Intellihep). This is a high profile event that provides support for entrepreneurs which will undoubtedly raise the profile of capabilities within IBCarb further to the wider biotech community.
An additional resource now available as a result of early IBCarb community discussions to industry members is Glyconeer - an automated carbohydrate synthesiser recently installed at the University of York.

Impact on academic sector:

IBCarb has actively encouraged younger researchers, especially PhDs and PDRAs to attend IBCarb events. This is facilitated through the availability of travel bursaries for ECR members to attend events. We anticipate this will encourage younger researchers to consider careers outside academia in the IB sector and allow them to establish the necessary industrial connections for that next career step through networking at IBCarb events. 
There are also examples of early career academics who have already hugely benefitted from participating in network events.
As a result of discussions at one of the first IBCarb events, 'Glycoscience Tools for Bioindustries,' Dr Martin Fascione, (University of York), co-ordinated a consortium bid for BBSRC ALERT-14 funding for the 'Glyconeer' project, headed by leading carbohydrate chemist Professor Gideon Davies (YSBL). The project is a multi -disciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Chemistry and Biology at York and scientists at the universities of Leeds, Oxford, Liverpool, Manchester and Imperial College London. Recently installed, this will prove to be a useful addition to the glyco-biotechnological tool kit available to researchers in the UK (see Q1).
Sarah Allman (Open University) - 'I participated in the IBCarb event 'Glycan Microarrays 2.0' where the idea for the IB Catalyst project 'Chemo-enzymatic production of specialty glycans' was identified. As a result, I am a participating member of this project consortium - a fantastic opportunity for me at this stage of my academic career, which possibly would not have happened had I not engaged with IBCarb.'</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are currently driving an initiative on the 'Metrology of Carbohydrates', which requires close interaction between industry and academia. IBCarb has recently hosted a workshop which was attended by ~57 delegates from a range of industries and academics from across the EU. This was a scoping workshop focusing on future metrology and analytical science needs over the next decade concerning carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, with particular reference to structure determination, sequencing, modeling, databases and standards. There were 22 flash presentations from the majority of the industry delegates (x30) present to establish the current state of the art and gaps in capabilities, and to formulate a list of potential metrology and measurement challenges, current &amp;amp; future, in various application areas. In order to maintain the momentum we are working to secure further funding to support the initiative (e.g. Horizon 2020 Coordination &amp;amp; Support Actions, COST Actions).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>425D3690-6701-4C3C-BA55-61EF90655F9B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54759a77f15370.61646088</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ibcarb.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>IBCarb Director Professor Sabine Flitsch shadows an MEP</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A9C49C5-AD13-44BB-B1E0-FA85774FECC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The IBCarb Director Professor Sabine Flitsch is participating in the MEP-Scientist Pairing Scheme and has been paired with the MEP Mairead McGuinness.
