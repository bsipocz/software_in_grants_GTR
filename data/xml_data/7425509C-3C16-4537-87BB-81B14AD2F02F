Whilst some research has focused on suitable leadership frameworks (Crosby and Bryson, 2005; Huxham and Vangen, 2000) and leadership capabilities (Vangen and Huxham, 2003; Williams, 2002) for these multi-organisation partnerships, relatively little is known about how they are governed. The aim of this research is to develop knowledge about the governance of partnerships involving TSOs. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Governance can be defined as the structures, systems and processes concerned with ensuring the overall direction, control and accountability of a partnership (Cornforth, 2004). Participant diversity, dynamics and change in roles challenge how governing is carried out. The focus of this research is on how participants use formal and social mechanisms to govern and manage the challenges, tensions and ambiguities that arise. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This will concentrate on how individuals make sense of working in and governing partnerships. Multiple cases will be selected and classified to extend existing theory and acknowledge key themes in current literature. Data in each case will be collected over a period of time to appreciate partnership development and how they change. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reporting research findings - 5 presentations at 5 meetings</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DEBDDD9E-333E-4766-B783-2CBAE1788CF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Findings were disseminated to the practitioner communities through five presentations and two reports (September 2011, July 2012). Three presentations and one report with one case, two presentations and one report with the second case.
Presentations attracted between 10 and 20 participants each time, with the grant holder facilitating reflection on their current governance arrangements and what was required in the future.

Subsequently there were changes in each collaboration. In the first, the local authority in the first collaboration fundamentally redesigned their governance structure in light of the findings to fit better their current demands. In the second, this led to the partnership to review its governance structures and processes and using the findings to emphasise the importance of participation to key stakeholders in the geographical area. This led to successfully gaining participation from absent key services and the new membership starting to redefine their terms of reference to reflect their purpose.

In one of the case study collaborations the grant holder remained engaged with decision-makers on neighbourhood regeneration after the end of the research grant. This involved discussing findings and developing suggestions in re-designing their governance structure to reflect their current aims, objectives and participants. The engagement beyond the grant suggests that participants benefited from the research and that it impacted their understanding about governance influencing how they took the next steps in their collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544c3efc5ca023.75441729</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011,2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8250</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Fellow funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Open University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7DFD71A9-E61F-4C96-954E-354D23509A98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544c3c8cb52f34.06695686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant holder used the emergent research findings to prompt and facilitate participants in the public-third sector collaborations to reflect on their current governance arrangements and what was required in the future. Subsequently there were changes in each collaboration and hence a social impact on broader society. Significantly, the local authority in the first collaboration fundamentally redesigned their governance structure in light of the findings to fit better their current demands. For example, the findings suggested that the original governance structure did not engage key stakeholders and was too complex for the purpose of demonstrating equitable and legitimate distribution of resources across deprived neighbourhoods. In the second collaboration research findings led to the partnership to review its governance structures and processes. In particular, this involved using the findings to emphasise to key stakeholders in the geographical area of the importance of their participation in the collaboration. This led to successfully gaining participation from absent key services and the new membership starting to redefine their terms of reference to reflect their purpose.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D0FB3C8E-BEE4-4402-A490-ACED4A7B5C39</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447d240dc1fe9.49645585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through this research, findings highlighted challenges, tensions, successes and participants' suggestions for the future. Challenges included difficulties in engaging residents and partners, defining purpose and specific tasks. Tensions described competing elements in carrying out governance e.g. competing priorities from individuals and the collaboration, developing both short and long term strategies, building engagement and getting some regeneration done. Successes recognised various achievements in the governance e.g. aligning resources, building a cross-sector focus and developing relationships between participants. Participants suggestions' for the future were analysed and developed into an approach for them to reconsider governance issues. This emphasised understanding the links between two potentially competing activities e.g. establishing a broad shared purpose and specific working groups, facilitating top-down and bottom-up relations, and allowing and area and theme focus to activities. Overall, findings that governance is a continuous and iterative process taking time and effort as individuals develop suitable governance structures. Any structure or the components of it are most likely to be short-lived, and individuals require skills to develop and maintain them. Failure to adapt, or gather support for change, may lead to the decline of a collaboration. 
Furthermore, the grant has allowed significant personal academic development. I have developed specialist knowledge on management, business and policy literature; professional networks through the British Academy of Management and become a reviewer at a number of journals (Public Management Review, Voluntary Sector Studies and Organization Studies). I have also gained experience of distance-learning in management teaching acting as a critical reader on a new MBA module, and continued developing publications from my doctoral thesis focusing on management.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings highlighted challenges, tensions, successes and participants' suggestions for the future. These may be taken forward by academics and practitioners (from civil society, public and private sectors). 
Findings were published in conferences and two academic journals: Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly and Public Management. For academics, findings offer new insights into how governance is conceptualised in cross-sector collaborations. In the first journal article, we outline new areas for academic research on the development of governance in collaborations to understand how effective governance unfolds over time and to investigate governance and leadership across multiple organizational levels. In the second, we create a distinction between two existing governance concepts highlighting the influence of design choices and how participants address them. This provides further approaches to investigate the highly dynamic nature of governance in collaborations. 
Practitioners in cross-sector collaborations can use research findings to reflect on the suitability of their current governance arrangements. As highlighted in the research, this could include identifying areas of inherent tensions (two competing activities and the link between them), assessing governance structures and demonstrating legitimate use of resources, prompting participation from key stakeholders or updating the terms of reference.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0D921502-822B-4D0B-B9B9-E745F74F3CE8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447d1e10344c2.98088671</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8B39B879-B7D9-43A2-84CC-3287188C8854</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nonprofit-Public Collaborations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/741ae46250c15c19a93de676d59b861f"><gtr:id>741ae46250c15c19a93de676d59b861f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cornforth C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543eea89899d70.78840876</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7561EAF3-A592-4D34-B30A-7ECA194C2AD5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tensions and governance in cross-sector partnerships</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bdf6a1316f16394cf9c8f6382dfec020"><gtr:id>bdf6a1316f16394cf9c8f6382dfec020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>John Paul Hayes (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_682559158113c6d230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC1CC437-F624-46D4-870A-8D0D63742F6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tensions a challenge to governance and cross-sector partnership survival</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bdf6a1316f16394cf9c8f6382dfec020"><gtr:id>bdf6a1316f16394cf9c8f6382dfec020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>John Paul Hayes (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_630316286513c6d168</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>40244685-6B3B-472D-8EEB-AFD753ADAAA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Governing Cross-Sector, Inter-Organizational Collaborations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Public Management Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bdd021e1b2a034325289e80a984a524c"><gtr:id>bdd021e1b2a034325289e80a984a524c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vangen S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543eea89da19e2.22260537</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-073-27-0033</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-073-27-0033</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
