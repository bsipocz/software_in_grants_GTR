&lt;p>The project aims to deliver an innovative programme of applied work that will foster improvements in the practice, monitoring, impacts and marketing of sustainable wildflower harvesting in South Africa's Western Cape. It does so through a partnership with a Western Cape NGO-the Flower Valley Conservation Trust (FVCT). The project therefore seeks to influence the policy and practice of ethical production for global markets in locally-specific ways, and also to promote learning from sustainable harvesting to a broader set of stakeholders beyond the case study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The specific objectives are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to build audit tools designed to improve sustainable picking practices in wildflower harvesting&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to develop training materials in order to improve the skills, opportunities and socio-economic gains of a culturally-diverse harvesting workforce&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to develop a better understanding of how sustainably-harvested wildflowers fit into the wider context of ethical consumerism in South Africa&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to promote the sustainable harvesting agenda to the biodiversity-conservation community in the Western Cape.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have a wide series of impacts, ranging from local-level improvements in operations, ecological management and wellbeing for suppliers and workers in sustainable wildflower harvesting in the Western Cape of South Africa, to cross-institutional learning outcomes for wider stakeholders in the South African biodiversity-conservation community and corporate responsibility management of UK corporations. Indeed, the central objectives of the project and its four inter-connected work packages are all tied to achieving a set of ambitious, yet achievable, targets with respect to harvesting improvements, more effective routes to sustainability, and knowledge exchange with stakeholders on the subject of corporate responsibility and sustainability.

Through Work Package 1, the key beneficiaries will be: the suppliers, picking teams and Flower Valley Conservation Trust's (FVCT's) conservation management team in terms of improved monitoring systems and techniques for sustainable harvesting, and the FVCT and its commercial partner, Fynsa, in terms of increasing the credibility of their Sustainable Harvesting Code of Practice. There will also be ecological benefits from this work package through the longitudinal assessments of harvesting impacts.

Through Work Package 2, the key beneficiaries will be: the Xhosa-speaking migrant workers from the Eastern Cape who will have access to the new multi-lingual learning resources used in training; members of picking teams benefitting from further ecological training and upskilling; and potential entrepreneurs in the local rural economy benefitting from training and support in small business start-up.

Work Package 3, embodying an original research component on the emergence of ethical consumerism in South Africa as a 'rising power' economy in the global South, will directly benefit FVCT and its commercial partner, Fynsa, in terms of a more comprehensive understanding of how their sustainably-harvested wild flowers fit into a broader South African 'ethical marketplace' through both niche and mainstream retail channels. This constitutes both a commercial and an ethical benefit for the organisations. However, the potential for knowledge exchange opportunities reaches further into benefits for wider stakeholders, such as Fruit South Africa (FruitSA) who work with transnational corporations as well as South African NGOs, consultancies and government to harmonise the implementation of ethical codes within South Africa's agricultural industries. Our pilot research will be valuable in enabling their programme to be aligned to the ethical concerns of domestic consumers. Similar learning outcomes are possible for UK-based retail members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), who have store networks in South Africa. Benefits from this work package are also expected to extend to the academic community in terms of shaping the agenda for knowledge exchange in applied geographical research on the 'rising powers'.

Work Package 4 represents the section of the project explicitly focused on communications and cross-institutional learning through the two Cape Town workshops and the UK-based presentation to the ETI in London. Key beneficiaries are numerous and fall into the following two categories: members of the Western Cape biodiversity-conservation community (e.g. the South African National Biodiversity Institute, Green Choice, CapeNature, Table Mountain Fund and Provincial Government) through the workshops on the operationalisation of biodiversity-business initiatives and discussion of Work Packages 1-3; and the ethical trade practitioner community in the UK including the corporate, NGO and union membership of the ETI to whom we will present the learning outcomes of this project and for whom learning on corporate engagement with innovative overseas partners will be valuable. The presentation to the ETI will be enhanced by the attendance and participation of a member of the FVCT.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74811</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Flower Valley Conservation Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Flower Valley Conservation Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A4446C0-EB4B-4F03-9B4C-8921407851FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work Package 1: Developing audit methodologies to enable effective monitoring of sustainable picking practice and landscape management.
Two tools have been developed: the Sustainable Harvesting Field Assessment and the Sustainable Harvesting Audit. These have been successfullycompleted and left as planned with FVCT to refine and pilot.

Work Package 2: Developing training materials and programmes to support social upliftment.
1) Content for a 'Working for Fynbos Field Guide' has been produced. This provides comprehensive information on wildflower species, including geographical distribution, market demand and vulnerability;
2) Working for fynbos video training resources have been developed;
3) Content for a national certificate course for emerging entrepreneurs within the landscape was developed.

Work Package 3: Research to improve understanding of the ethical consumerism context that drives the domestic market in South Africa for sustainably-harvested bouquets.
21 interviews with key institutional actors involved in shaping ethical markets in the Western Cape were conducted. 10 focus groups with Western Cape consumers were also carried out. The findings were presented at our project dissemination workshop on 27th March (see below) and also form two academic papers completed in draft and to be submitted to a Geoforum Special Issue. Key findings concern the significance of local and national cultural politics to the consumption of sustainably harvested fynbos bouquets and the rising significance of ethical consumption in South Africa more broadly. We plan to develop an ESRC Responsive Mode grant application on the theme of ethical consumption in the global South, which takes forward this research.

Work Package 4: Promoting the sustainable harvesting agenda in the Western Cape and UK.
1) A highly successful project dissemination workshop was held on Thursday 27th March 2014 at the headquarters of the World Wildlife Fund in Cape Town. Some 30 members of the Western Cape conservation community, corporate retailers, ethical trading associations and NGOs attended to hear work package presentations given by all members of the academic and FVCT project team. These presentations appear on the project website. We also incorporated interactive sessions. The workshop and project findings were very well-received.

2) FVCT Conservation manager, Roger Bailey, visited London in May 2014 for a successful Knowledge Exchange visit involving attendance at an ethical trading workshop on 21st May, a visit with the RA to a commercial flower distributor and a meeting to present project findings to Marks &amp;amp; Spencer (one of FVCT's key customers).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a30e77ec0c2.83223060-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>FVCT provided botanical expertise and access to their farms, plus organisational assistance with creating audit tools and training materials.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project sets out to develop the work of the FVCT and to promote the cause of sustainable harvesting in both South Africa and the UK through a set of progressive and applied mechanisms.

Content for the sustainable harvesting tool, the videos to guide workers in sustainable harvesting of wildflowers and the Field Guide for Wildflower Harvesting was produced with KE funding from this grant. With ESRC IAA (January 2015-) funds at both Newcastle and Durham Universities, the outputs of the videos and Field Guide are now being professionally designed, produced and printed and will be ready from Summer/Autumn 2015 to be widely used in practice by FVCT and its trainers and workers. Funding from this KE grant therefore enabled the production of content for the audit tool, videos and Field Guide ready for FVCT to use. However, IAA funding has been used to enhance this content by actually producing 'hard' outputs for use by FVCT and their stakeholders. IAA and internal university funding has been used to embed the impact of these hard outputs, in particular the field guides.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD661976-E545-4183-A776-0C0AC712D1BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463e816381ce0.45800726</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Knowledge Exchange project developed and promoted best practice in sustainable harvesting within the South African wildflower industry-a sector supplying high-value, ethically-sourced bouquets to UK and South African high street retailers and supermarkets.
