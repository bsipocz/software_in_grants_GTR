The continued failure to reach agreement concerning how to deal with the past has created destabilising social and political tensions in Northern Irish society. Both the collective memory and forgetting of traumatic events of the past has political implications, affecting prospects for peace and reconciliation. Commemoration in Northern Ireland is thus fraught and contested. 

The societal role of commemoration in all its forms is of critical importance for policy makers and those seeking to understand both the perpetuation and successful regulation of conflict. The notions of memory, commemoration, contested space and territory will be central to the seminar, a key site of conflict in the culture wars in Northern Ireland. These debates are not only academic: the effects of territorial struggle and claims on contested space continue today, with effects ranging from the recent social unrest surrounding parades, to dissident paramilitary violence and the future political development of Northern Ireland.

We recognise that it is essential that policy makers have an improved understanding of the role of social memory and commemoration within communities. The seminar will help to facilitate such an understanding through a dialogue between academics, practitioners, politicians and policy makers. 

Broadly, this will include examining the political and social policy implications emerging from a detailed scrutiny of the roles of memory, commemoration and forgetting in Northern Ireland. This will include the role of history and heritage education and its effects on young people, identity formation and citizenship issues. It will also include a comparative dimension, reflecting on the role of truth recovery and dealing with the past in other divided societies, the heritage industry and the official (and unofficial) role of commemoration both in societies divided by violent conflict and those whose divisions are predominantly cultural and ideological. Meetings 2, 4 and 6 will include international keynote speakers.

The series will draw on the organisers' expertise in conflict analysis and bring together participants from several
disciplinary backgrounds, including political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, historians, policy analysts, alongside those working in the heritage sector, education, government and NGOs, and other civil society organisations. It will reflect on both past and recent issues concerning the role of memory and forgetting in Northern Ireland in comparative perspective.

The proposed seminar series will consist of six open one-day events, each engaging with specific issues relevant to the seminar theme,
broadly defined as: the analysis of current research trends and methodologies of memory; symbols of commemoration and
sites of memory (both physical and intellectual); collective memory and forgetting (including the re-memorising of 'great
events'); the culture wars - the politics of commemoration and socialisation; the role of memory and reconciliation
(comparative approaches) and a final seminar discussing the policy implications of the research, with input from Northern
Ireland politicians, NGOs, media and members of the policy community.

The organisers have well established academic, practitioner and community links across Northern Ireland which will ensure the successful composition, engagement and delivery of the seminar series

Proposed outcomes from the seminar will include academic publications, downloadable policy resources, and an open access report of discussions and recommendations, ensuring broad public engagement and wide dissemination of the seminar findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is envisaged that those involved in the seminar will benefit in differing ways, broadly as follows:

Seminar participants
As outlined in our section on academic beneficiaries, the seminar series will expand our knowledge base, build
interdisciplinary networks, facilitate new research partnerships and develop links between established, early career researchers and postgraduates. The seminar offers participants scope for developing multi-disciplinary methods to ensure that evidence provided across various research approaches is properly exploited and linked to policy developments. It will bring together established academics, policy formulators and practitioners, as well as less experienced colleagues and postgraduates across related fields. While the seminar series rests on a core grouping of selected individuals, open invitations will be issued to all seminars, expanding the level of engagement with the wider academic community. The network generated by the seminar will facilitate further bids. It is envisaged that these may include Research Councils and Horizon 2020.

Government and Policy-makers
Issues of memory and forgetting cut across a range of policy areas, influencing governmental and non-governmental initiatives concerning social, cultural, political and economic citizenship and identity(ies). Changing established methods of remembrance and commemoration can be a fraught if necessary process as has been shown in Northern Ireland by the failure of the Haass/ O'Sullivan initiative to resolve such issues which have resulted in violent protests about parades and flags and dealing with the past. Drawing on expertise focused both on Northern Ireland and comparable divided societies the seminars will critically reflect and review ideas for a more consensual solution to these issues and encourage critical reflection amongst those involved in projects designed to encourage accommodation and partnership on the ground. The seminar will compile a report on its findings to the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.

An online resource consisting of policy recommendations will also be produced. This downloadable toolkit will provide legislators and practitioners with valuable policy advice, gleaned from the conversations between the seminar participants. This public resource will strengthen and complement the academic, peer-reviewed publications generated by the research seminar.

Heritage Professionals, archivists, librarians and event organisers
In encouraging participation from those involved in staging exhibitions and managing sites or festivals the researchers within the network will broaden their knowledge of methods and locations of commemoration. In turn the seminar will act as a repository of information on relevant institutions and exhibits and encourage the development of non-academic networks. The emphasis on addressing (deliberately) forgotten events and figures and the encouragement of more plural interpretations of the past will also provide a wealth of ideas about events and people with legacies to explore that would secure funding and attract visitors.

The third sector and community organisations
Civil society organisations and grassroots groups will be fully engaged in the seminar driven by the ethos of mutual inspiration from the project in terms of generating new ideas, create positive associations and legacies as well as a forum for the mutual transfer of ideas and experience. In addition, groups working within single-identity frameworks would benefit by being able to gain information on perspectives and activism within other communities by there will be a further exchange of information generated by the diverse set of case studies that will be introduced throughout the seminar.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30033</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Northern Ireland: memory, commemoration and public symbolism - dealing with the past</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF545345-B4FB-4161-BF5A-EF35A994F3EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10.00-10.15 The Dean of Portsmouth and Dave Carpenter (University of Portsmouth) give an introduction to the event
