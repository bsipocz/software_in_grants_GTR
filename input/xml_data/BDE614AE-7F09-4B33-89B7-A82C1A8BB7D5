Before medical applications can be realised safely, it is vital that we develop a deep understanding of the biology behind stem cells. Our proposal aims to provide a significant and timely contribution to the understanding of a type of stem cell that generates pigment cells and part of the nervous system. It builds on our recent discovery that a gene better known for its importance in human cancers has a critical and totally unexpected role in a zebrafish model in development of these stem cells, probably in helping them choose which type of cell to develop into. We propose a set of experiments that address exactly what this gene is doing in these stem cells. This is highly relevant because although the defect is in a specific type of pigment cell that humans do not share, nevertheless equivalent decisions (e.g. the choice between neurons and associated cells called glia) are of fundamental importance. Our system presents major advantages for the study of this sort of process within the complex living organism and thus will be a suitable test case enabling deep understanding. Furthermore, we have significant reason to expect this same gene to also function in development of the brain and we strongly expect this function to be shared between humans and zebrafish. We propose methods to study this role in our accessible zebrafish model which will provide vital background for subsequent work in higher animals, whilst at the same time limiting the amount of exploratory work necessary in these mammalian animals. This study is made very timely by recent work from a collaborating laboratory in Germany that suggests precisely what this role, hitherto completely unclear, might be. We will test this proposed role directly. This work, due to its nature as a fundamental contribution to scientific knowledge, is best presented in the scientific literature and at conferences where the relevant specialists will be able to see it. In addition, we may, where relevant, incorporate some of this material into talks for a general audience that we give.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>While stem cells have great potential for disease therapy, their safe use in human patients demands a deep understanding of their biology. Neural crest (NC) cells are a population of stem cells. Their biological interest partly derives from their ability to generate multiple cell types (e.g. neurons and glia; different pigment cell-types) that will occupy adjacent embryonic sites. Their medical interest derives from the multiple human inherited conditions resulting from failures of NC development or physiology. Receptor tyrosine kinases are key mediators of diverse functions in NC development, but to date Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) has not been implicated in any aspect of NC development. The endogenous function of this key proto-oncogene has remained elusive, but it is implicated in CNS development. Here we plan to exploit our recent molecular identification of a zebrafish pigmentation mutant, shady, as the first loss-of-function mutants of an ALK orthologue, alk. Our initial data suggests that Alk affects an early step, most likely fate choice, of pigment cell development from NC. We will test definitively this and alternative models of Alk function in NC. We will use in situ hybridisation, expression of tagged activated Alk protein, transgenic reporter lines and single-cell labelling to address when and how Alk functions in NC development. We have strong evidence identifying Midkine A (Mdka) as the endogenous ligand mediating Alk function in NC. We will test this indirectly via a genetic enhancer test and directly via yeast two-hybrid studies. We will address where and when Alk ligands (Mdka and potentially others) are expressed in vivo using an affinity probe. We hope that publications resulting from these studies will identify the role and timing of Alk in pigment cell development and will inform our biological understanding of NC cell fate choice. Then we will broaden our investigations to assay shady mutant embryos for defects in CNS development. Work by our collaborators identifying a role for Mdka in medial floorplate specification suggests the floorplate as a likely site of Alk function in the CNS. We will test this, using multiple tools generated by their lab to assay Alk function in the ventral CNS. Thus, we hope to outline an evolutionarily-conserved role of Alk function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>299934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B5168FB-C5A5-4A98-B295-D7848BA76823</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The University of Bath issued a press release around the time of the publication of the Lopes et al, 2008 paper, the first publication to result from data acquired during this project.
