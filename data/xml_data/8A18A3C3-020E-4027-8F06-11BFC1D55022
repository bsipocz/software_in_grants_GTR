Migration Crisis in the Mediterranean.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N013727/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The ongoing migration crisis in the Mediterranean affects all European Countries and is one of the major challenges in European policy making. According to the UN Refugee Agency, 103,000 boat migrants crossed the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2015. 54,000 of them arrived in Italy and 48,000 in Greece. More than 1800 perished, or are missing at sea.
 In 2014, Kirtsoglou, Lyon and Knight carried out a Durham University funded pilot study of migrant communities in Greece and established links to an international network of academics, governmental and non-governmental organizations eager to develop new grassroots initiatives and collaborations. We propose to extend and deepen our initial involvement, by investigating in situ the management of migration emergencies in the critically affected regions of south Italy and the eastern Aegean islands. Our aim is to document and understand migrant subjectivities and motives behind high-risk irregular migration, to identify potemtial gaps in reception structures and to assess the effects of migration on receiving communities. We will engage in a programme of rigorous anthropological research that will involve extended interviews with migrants, local communities, NGO staff and policy makers. We will also carry out extensive observational research in a range of settings such as reception centres, migrant support groups and other community-based locations. Working in collaboration with humanitarian organisations and local government authorities, we will use this data to inform migration policies in the region. 

Capitalising on our existing links with a network of major stakeholders in two countries and a bottom-up comparative research approach we will pursue the following interconnected questions that demand immediate attention:

1) What are the main drivers of high risk migration journeys and how do migrants calculate and weigh-up risk prior to the journey and in its aftermath? 
2) How do migrants negotiate the macro-processes that govern migration including border control and asylum seeking policies, and what are the main deficiencies in governmental structures and local systems of reception, including accommodation and screening infrastructures?
3) What is the role of local communities in managing migration flows and what is the importance of new forms of social interaction and relationships that emerge from emergency migration encounters in building networks of solidarity toward irregular migrants? 
4) What can the comparison of Italian and Greek contexts teach policy developers and NGOs as they endeavour to respond to this crisis? 

Irregular migration is a complex phenomenon intimately related to different fields such as human rights, national and supranational policies, labour exploitation and economics, lack of sustainable development, international conflict escalation, corruption and security. A fine-grained anthropological account of the social dynamics of emergency migration encounters can provide critical insights on all these different fields. The proposed research aims to go beyond offering a critique to migration policies. By focusing on key actors involved, we lay the basis for comprehensive collaborations between social scientists, humanitarian aid practitioners, governmental and non-governmental authorities. A network of Greek and Italian NGOs support the project, alongside a team with long term involvement and a track record of outstanding research in the critical regions of south and south-eastern Mediterranean. We are uniquely equipped to deliver a wide evidence base of the social, material, legal and political dimensions of migration emergencies and to build new information channels that will help practitioners and authorities exchange knowledge, refine policies and improve the management of future migration crises.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The present project has been carefully designed to produce research-led impact appropriate for the crisis situations that are currently unfolding. Specifically, it is directed towards the development of new policies that would improve the management of the Mediterranean migration crisis in line with UNHCR initiatives towards preventing deaths at sea. While acknowledging the centrality of South Italy as one of the major Mediterranean migration routes, we also place special emphasis on eastern Mediterranean, in line with UNCHR observations and two stress calls in June 2015 (9/6 &amp;amp; 16/6) for support to Greece that has long reached reception capacity limits. This cross-country, combined focus has multiple benefits including coverage of the affected area and the opportunity to compare migrant experiences, reception structures, acute and more long term problems. 

A key pathway to impact will be a large collaborative network of academics, governmental and non-governmental authorities and actors engaged in migration management which will create new information-exchange channels between practitioners on the ground and policy makers at various levels. For this reason we have invited a number of NGOs operating in both countries and internationally to support the project. This research is the first of its kind in that it combines the experience of academics with long-term exposure in the critical regions, with the expertise of stakeholders involved in human rights organisations, humanitarian aid, and international advocacy. Comprehensive attention to the perspective of afflicted persons, the micro-structures of migration and the larger problems related to states, bureaucracies, national and international legislation makes this project at once sensitive to the demands of a social emergency, and capable of generating theoretical advances in the social sciences and policy development recommendations. 


The goals of our impact strategy are: 

1. To build an international network that will allow practitioners and academics to compare knowledge and data from two different countries currently at the epicenter of the Mediterranean migration crisis. 
2. To produce specific, research-led and practice-informed recommendations that will be shared with policy makers locally and across Europe through our network of NGOs and key stakeholders.
3. To bring governmental authorities together with academics, human rights and humanitarian aid practitioners establishing new communication channels between the three sectors in order to address: security, legislative and economic considerations, the improvement of humanitarian-aid and asylum seeking structures, issues related to protection-capacity building and new forms of citizenship that might arise as a result of migration flows.
4. To sensitise the public on reasons behind migration emergencies through publicising the results of our research in accessible print formats, targeted media interventions, public debates and dissemination events organized in the field sites and broadcasted in local media. 

Beneficiaries of this research therefore include migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, academic users, NGOs, governmental authorities, policy makers, receiving communities and the general public. By building awareness among key stakeholders and co-producing knowledge will them, this project will build sustainable links between academics, practitioners and policy makers that would result in enhanced future planning capacity, and significant improvements in the management of migration emergency contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>143545</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Additionally to other outputs expected from this project, we are preparing a documentary film that follows the lives of several refugees who were trapped in Greece following the border closures in March 2016.

Key findings will be shared at the end of the award, but some preliminary findings include: 

1. Refugee movement into Europe depends more on 'push' factors (war and conflict in countries of origin) than 'pull factors' (the promise of economic prosperity in Europe). 

2. Greece and Italy remain in the consciousness of refugees as transit countries. This is especially true for Greece and relates to the effects of the Greek crisis on local economy and national infrastructure. Despite the fact that displacement is not driven by economic factors, displaced populations wish to make a fresh start in countries that are considered as offering job opportunities and relevant infrastructure that would make this possible. 

3. The current refugee crisis has unprecedented consequences (physical and emotional) for the protection and well-being of minors (both accompanied and unaccompanied children). Relevant preliminary report was shared with both ESRC and DFID. 

4. Local governments (Greece and Italy) engage in serious efforts to provide shelter and protection to the refugees but there is still considerable work to be done in building the kind of infrastructure that could provide safe and human conditions of living to the displaced. 

5. National (Greek and Italian) and international NGOs are providing significant humanitarian aid but the changing landscape and the continuous movement of displaced persons pose serious challenges. Current border closures (Balkan route) have caused the exposure of a large number of refugees to the elements of nature. The re-deployment of humanitarian aid from other parts of the country where is currently concentrated (Greek islands) cannot be realised in a short period of time. 

6. Local communities (Greece and Italy) remain of vital importance to humanitarian assistance. This is especially true for Greece where new spots of humanitarian need (borders with Macedonia) have emerged.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project is still at the stage of preliminary findings. The team will report on key findings in 2017 when the project finishes. It is however important to note that our research findings are relevant to non-academic and academic users. 

According to the project's timetable a policy-recommendations' report will be prepared by the end of June 2016. This report will be shared with policy-makers in Greece and Italy and relevant stakeholders in the two countries and the European Council. The findings of this research will:
 
1) Provide politicians and policy-makers with research evidence on the reasons behind the journeys of refugees to Europe (access to the perspective of the displaced)

2) Provide policy-makers with a comprehensive report on the current problems with reception structures (hot-spots and relocation camps). 

3) Demonstrate the importance and role of actors at local level. This includes NGOs, local authorities and local communities. 

These findings will inform policy-making. 

The project is also furthering academic research as it provides the academic community with new insights on emergency migration encounters.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49B61370-83D3-449A-A684-525787A2C4E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16a75be8fe9.29484451</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://transitorylives.net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>High Level Conference on the rights of Children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D9B07EA-9FDF-4145-B756-E5426EBFD8C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>RA, Dr. Tyrikos-Ergas participated in high level policy conference to launch the Strategy for the rights of the Child 2016-2021, Sofia, Bulgaria.
