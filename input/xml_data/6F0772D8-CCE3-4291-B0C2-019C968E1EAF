EPSRC DTP-funded students at Glasgow are split between the Colleges of Science &amp;amp; Engineering (the majority) &amp;amp; Medical Veterinary &amp;amp; Life Sciences. In the former, students are selected for projects across 5 Schools (Chemistry, Computing Science, Engineering, Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics &amp;amp; Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy). In the latter, students are engaged in projects mainly in the Inst of Molecular, Cell &amp;amp; Systems Biology broadly related to biomedical engineering. College-level Grad Schools provide a focus for activity for students &amp;amp; embed them in an environment of equal opportunity for all.This maximises the opportunities for students to benefit from inter-disciplinary interaction &amp;amp; engage with other students who will form the professional networks that will enhance their future careers. We also create opportunities for our students to engage with the external stakeholders of their research.
Studentships are allocated across Schools broadly using an approach based on the value of the current research portfolio to ensure that students are aligned to areas of particular strength within EPSRC research areas. This is further refined through consideration of current large projects that would provide supportive environments for students, areas where other significant investment has already taken place or an emerging collaboration is making an impact or to develop early career researchers who are ready to take on more supervision.
Areas given priority for developing studentship projects in the near future are:
 Biomaterials &amp;amp; Tissue Engineering
 Chemical Biology &amp;amp; Biological Chemistry
 Energy Efficiency (End Use Energy Demand)
 Energy Storage
 Fluid Dynamics &amp;amp; Aerodynamics
 Human-Computer Interaction
 ICT Networks &amp;amp; Distributed Systems
 Microsystems
 Non CMOS Device Technology
 Quantum Devices, Components and Systems
 Quantum Optics &amp;amp; Information
 Sensors &amp;amp; Instrumentation
 Statistics and Applied Probability
 Synthetic Biology
 Synthetic Coordination Chemistry
 Water Engineering
The DTP studentship application process is identical to other University of Glasgow
scholarships. In response to advertised studentships or research group openings, students submit on-line applications http://www.gla.ac.uk/research/opportunities/howtoapplyforaresearchdegree/ (either in CSE or CMVLS). This process requires the same documentation from all students (degree grade transcripts, CV, references &amp;amp; usually a project outline). Scholarship funding calls are released in the autumn &amp;amp; early winter, generally with early spring deadlines. Students may apply for several funding opportunities &amp;amp; students applying for DTP funding are considered alongside the wider cohort. Excellent students may be asked if they would like to be considered for DTP funding where they are eligible. We can thus ensure the best students are appointed to the appropriate funding opportunities. If DTP places remain unfilled during this spring assessment then applications will be considered as received until places are filled.
DTP funded students at Glasgow benefit from School-level subject specific training to
support the development of their research skills. They further benefit from Grad School &amp;amp; University level programmes that support their personal and professional development. There is an impressive range of activity on offer &amp;amp; students have opportunities to develop, for example, basic skills (presentation, project management), research-related skills (research integrity, data management), science communication &amp;amp; public engagement skills (Science Slam, Three Minute Thesis, Ideas Exchange, Explorathon) &amp;amp; enterprise skills (Insights to Industry, Research Frontiers Challenges, Innovation Platform activities). These activities also allow students to interact with industry partners, students from other areas within the University as well as students from other institutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6095718</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509668/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
