Most neurons of the system are grouped into ganglia that lie along the spinal column, called dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Axons from DRG neurons grow to the skin, muscle, organs and other tissues of the trunk and limbs (target fields) where specialised nerve endings sense stimuli such as heat, cold, movement, vibration and harmful chemicals. Each DRG contains a number of different types of sensory neurons each specialized to sense a particular type of stimulus. Neurons that detect extremes of heat, cold and mechanical stimuli and harmful chemicals, signal pain to us and are called nociceptive neurons. Neurotrophic factors are a group of proteins that have beneficial or trophic effects on neurons. In the developing embryo, sensory neurons require various neurotrophic factors for survival and for growth of their axons to target fields. After birth, neurotrophic factors are still required by some sensory neurons to survive. They are also required to keep axons in contact with their target fields and help axons re-grow to their target fields after injury. Neurotrophic factors also direct different types of sensory neurons to become specialized to sense particular types of stimuli. Different functional types of sensory neurons require different neurotrophic factors for survival, maintenance of axons and maintenance of specific functional properties. Macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) is a protein with numerous effects on skin, blood, epithelial and bone cells. MSP exerts its effects on responsive cells by binding to a cell surface receptor protein called RON. Much of the research investigating the roles of neurotrophic factors has been carried out in the mouse. Recently, MSP has been shown to have a novel neurotrophic role on mouse sensory neurons, promoting their survival in embryonic development in much the same way as another neurotrophic factor, NGF. It also appears to behave like NGF in regulating the expression of functionally important genes in adult mouse DRG neurons placed in tissue culture, suggesting that some adult pain-sensing DRG neurons require MSP as a neurotrophic factor for normal functioning and MSP may determine the functional characteristics of some types of sensory neurons. This project will study, in detail, the role that MSP plays in the normal development and functioning of mouse DRG neurons. First, I will carefully characterise what types of DRG neurons respond to MSP at different ages from birth to adult. Next I will determine whether MSP is required for the survival of DRG neurons, especially pain-sensing neurons, in newborn, juvenile and adult mice. To make this possible, a genetically altered mouse will be created that allows the MSP receptor RON to be functionally disabled in pain-sensing neurons when desired. Next, I will investigate whether MSP can promote the growth of newborn, juvenile and adult DRG neuron axons and whether the number of nociceptive neuron nerve endings are reduced in the skin of adult mice in the absence of functional RON. Following this, I will find out whether the ability of mice to detect heat, mechanical stimuli and chemicals is altered when the neurotrophic effects of MSP are blocked by disabling RON in pain-sensing neurons. Nerve injury and chronic diseases like diabetes can stop neurons working properly resulting in either persistent pain (neuropathic pain) or the sensation of tingling, pins and needles and/or numbness (neuropathy). The symptoms of neuropathy are often associated with a loss of nociceptor nerve endings in the skin. I will investigate whether MSP normally provides protection against nerve injury. I will do this by disabling RON in nociceptive neurons and seeing whether this makes neuropathic pain and diabetic neuropathy worse in experimental mouse models of these diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neurotrophic factors play an important role in the developing embryonic peripheral sensory nervous system by regulating neuroblast survival, neuronal differentiation, post-mitotic neuron survival and target field innervation. Postnatally, neurotrophic factors promote the survival of some subpopulations of sensory neurons, maintain correct terminal arborisation/innervation in the target field and promote neuronal survival and regeneration of axons following nerve injury. In the adult, neurotrophic factors also play a crucial role in determining the functional characteristics of different types of sensory neurons with different modalities. MSP, a protein that has multiple actions on blood cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes and osteoclasts, has recently been shown to have novel neurotrophic properties on developing mouse sensory neurons. MSP promotes the in-vitro survival of and neurite outgrowth from a subset of NGF dependent DRG neurons during the late embryonic and early neonatal period. MSP can also mimic NGF in regulating the expression of a number of functionally important genes in cultured adult DRG neurons, with preliminary data suggesting significant overlap between NGF and MSP responsive neurons. I propose to fully elucidate the normal role of MSP in the neonatal, juvenile and adult mouse sensory nervous system in terms of regulating neuronal survival, target field innervation and the functional properties of neurons. This information will significantly add to current knowledge of how the co-ordinated actions of neurotrophic factors promote the survival, target field innervation and biochemical differentiation of different subsets of neurons, leading to the generation of adult sensory neuron sub-populations with distinct functional characteristics. I will create a transgenic mouse line in which cells expressing the MSP receptor, RON, are fluorescently labelled with EGFP. This line will be used to determine the number of MSP responsive DRG neurons at different ages from birth to adult, and to characterise them in terms of cell size and the expression of established sensory neuron markers. DRG neurons will be isolated from RON-EGFP mice at neonatal, juvenile and adult stages and the ability of MSP to promote in-vitro survival and neurite outgrowth/branching will be ascertained at each age. A triple-transgenic mouse (NFRER) will be created that allows tamoxifen induced, temporally controlled deletion of functional RON in nociceptive sensory neurons and the identification of putative MSP responsive neurons by EGFP fluorescence. The in-vivo survival requirements of DRG nociceptive neurons for MSP will be determined at different ages by tamoxifen induced deletion of RON in NFRER mice and subsequent quantification of EGFP fluorescent neurons. To ascertain whether MSP is required for normal terminal arborisation of nociceptive fibres and reinnervation/arborisation following injury, the effect of RON deletion on the intra-epidermal innervation density of footpad skin will be assessed in non-lesioned mice and mice that have had footpad nerve endings ablated by capsaicin treatment. Behavioural testing in tamoxifen induced and non-induced adult NFRER mice will be used to determine whether MSP contributes to the setting of thermal, mechanical and chemical nociceptive thresholds in adult DRG neurons. RT-QPCR will also be used to quantify the expression of a number of mRNAs encoding neuropeptides and ligand/voltage gated ion channels in DRG of these animals. The effect that nociceptor RON deletion has on the severity of surgically induced neuropathic pain and chemically induced diabetic neuropathy will be determined, in appropriate mouse models, to assess whether endogenous MSP has a neuro-protective role in situations of nerve trauma. If MSP is neuro-protective, this will be of interest to researchers in pain and neuropathy fields as it raises the possibility that exogenous MSP may be beneficial in these pathological conditions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224265</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>06F098ED-4F62-4E3D-8C1D-245AE22183AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Macrophage stimulating protein is a neurotrophic factor for a sub-population of adult nociceptive sensory neurons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and cellular neurosciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ba9446a75744955ded8c5e9005ab2b8b"><gtr:id>ba9446a75744955ded8c5e9005ab2b8b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Franklin SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1044-7431</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544d2888719fd4.25962884</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D01168X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
