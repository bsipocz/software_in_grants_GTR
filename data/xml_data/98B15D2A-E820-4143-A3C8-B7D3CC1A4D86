money and credit management through visually engaging, easy-to-use gaming mechanisms. It
is an independent and unbiased financial tool, which will serve to start building an early real
world credit score for its users and is powered by a real-time, real credit-data website.
For the user, it is a first step into the world of finance and credit. It will teach students about
credit and give them the tools they need to budget responsibly; a vital skill, which they
currently aren?t being taught in school. A survey undertaken by the Save The Student
organisation found that 80% of students surveyed said that money worries are on their mind
throughout university, with quotes like:
We should have been given finance lessons when coming to university, most students have
never had to budget before. I came from earning &amp;pound;200 a month in a part-time job at Halfords
to being given &amp;pound;1,750 in my first month at university. I spent the lot in the first two weeks and
survived on pasta and lentils for the next two months!
The App will also provide financial institutions with predictive insights into behaviours and
aptitudes which can then replace guesswork and translate into higher customer acquisition and
loyalty whilst significantly reducing their exposure to bad debt. In real terms this would mean
more favourable credit and loan terms for the user, less risk for the lender.
Ultimately, we envisage that $core will make a significant positive impact on society and will
be beneficial to the UK economy. We see better management of credit and finances as a key
requisite for the employees and entrepreneurs of the future. Facilitating the early repayment of
student loans, driving reduction, eliminating or reducing the need for payday loans and
providing increased early investment opportunities for the savvy student would serve a future
economy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700469</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
