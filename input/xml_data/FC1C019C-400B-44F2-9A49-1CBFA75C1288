We use the Alkire-Foster or AF (2011) method, in two very new and policy-relevant ways. The AF method first observes which deprivations each person experiences. It identifies people as multidimensionally poor based on the percentage of deprivations they have, then builds a rigorous but simple measure. 

1. Repeated cross-sectional AF measures now exist for a large number of countries to analyse the trends and drivers of extreme multidimensional poverty-at both the individual and group level. Poverty levels and trends will be disaggregated by ethnicity, regions, caste, religion, age group, and the drivers of change will be analysed. At the macro level we will study pathways out of poverty related to public expenditure, growth, inequality, governance, policy integration, and other variables. Because ethnic and religious groups are often among the poorest of the poor, we will look up close at poverty of these different groups, to see if a general reduction in poverty included them--or left them behind. At the micro level we will check whether households without an empowered woman seem to have been left behind more often. We will then be able to analyse whether and in what circumstances settings with 'integrated policies' go along with high rates of poverty reduction, or more equalizing trends across social groups. 

Doing this research requires us to construct, first of all, an innovative, high quality, and large set of poverty statistics ('databank). We anticipate that this data bank will include data on sixty countries, including over 30 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, plus 13 of the 15 poorest countries in South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America. We should have disaggregated data down to the subnational level for about three-quarters of the countries. The final dataset with its associated statistics will be made publically available, and will provide the basis for the proposed micro and macro-econometric analyses to be undertaken in this research.

2. We aim to evaluate what policies have been effective in enabling the poor to escape multiple interconnected dimensions of poverty. We will undertake two country case studies (probably Nepal and Senegal), working closely with government members of the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network. Through extensive qualitative interviews with policy leaders and analysts, we will undertake a study of integrated policy interventions and their effectiveness in reducing poverty in several dimensions. These studies provide the project with more localized, contextualized insights that impact project outputs and poverty reduction policies. This research will prove invaluable to other countries wishing to design integrated policies to reduce multidimensional poverty.

We will also design and test a new multidimensional methodology for formal impact evaluation. This innovative approach to impact evaluation will enable research users to evaluate programmes and certain policies using a multidimensional lens. This will provide a new tool to pinpoint what kinds of integrated policies better enable the poor to leave and stay out of several dimensions of poverty at the same time. The use of multidimensional outcome measures in RCTs could alter the RCT landscape.
 
An objective of this research is to focus on the possible policy uptake of lessons learned and research findings. Our experience with the country members of the MPPN, a network of 37 countries for which OPHI acts a Secretariat, shows us that involving these governments as partners from the very beginning is essential to insure research uptake. Also essential are effective and proactive communications strategies to reach strategic audie</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Stream one of the research will produce new econometric analyses of multidimensional poverty that will go beyond description to analyse the determinants of poverty reduction, and do so in over 60 countries. Academics and others working in poverty research and analysis will benefit since this is brand new research in terms of methodology and country coverage. The findings will also impact integrated policy responses-as we uncover what have been the most effective combination of policies to reduce multidimensional poverty. The research outputs will provide insights on how the different aspects of poverty are interrelated-giving governments policy levers for more effective anti poverty policies. Since the work will be planned from the beginning with MPPN country members, it will be through this forum that we expect the immediate uptake of this work.

In Stream 2, the major impact will be on impact evaluation methodologies and their alternatives. The use of multidimensional outcome measures in RCTs could alter the RCT landscape. These multidimensional RCTs will provide better, more integrated analyses of changes in interlocking deprivations to those wishing to evaluate multi-sectoral, multi-objective projects. The qualitative country case studies will complement the quantitative work and methodologies, and will provide the two countries chosen (most likely Nepal and Senegal) with detailed and policy-oriented analysis to inform actions in the short term. 

Through uptake of its findings in both research streams by the public sector as well as other agencies (as in the case of the MPI), the expected impact is on the lives of the poor-better data leading to more integrated and effective policies to move the poor out of poverty.

To the greatest extent possible, we involve collaborators from the study contexts and we invest in junior scholars with mentoring and capacity building via email and Skype.

Both streams of research will generate papers to be published first as OPHI working papers and then as peer-reviewed academic papers. The econometric analysis and the RCTs will each yield a set of field-building papers that may form at least one special issue of a journal. 

Our harmonized databank on multidimensional poverty will be freely accessible online. The proposed ground-breaking studies on ethnic and religious decompositions of multidimensional poverty will be posted with the same detail as existing subnational tables over time. This will enable other researchers to use the databank for additional research.

With our close working connection with the MPPN countries, we will translate research results into policy briefs, and make presentations at the annual meetings of the MPPN. Based on the results of the research we will make recommendations for improved anti-poverty actions.

We will publish the two case studies and with our local collaborators in those countries make presentations of results to the governments, academia and civil society of those countries.

A new set of empirical studies on multidimensional impacts will be published as working papers as well as in peer-reviewed academic journals, We will develop and publish a modified multidimensional RCT evaluation method.

To make the methodologies and results developed under this project accessible to stakeholders and researcher users, they will verified, then be made available in OPHI's training courses and website. OPHI stresses individual capacity building through intensive, technical training and technical support. OPHI will incorporate this project's research outcomes into its (separately funded) training and technical support programs so that research users have accessible guidelines for implementation based on extensive and detailed academic studies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400637</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>OPHI Side Event at March UN Statistical Commission</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA8FEF60-50A5-469F-8BB9-DADD7F7445BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a special High-Level Side Event at the UN Statistical Commission in New York on Tuesday 7 March.

The Commission is the key UN statistical entity, with participation from national and international statistical leaders from across the world. The very first agenda item at this session is the indicator framework to be used for measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). For OPHI and the MPPN, this Side Event was a good opportunity to share countries' experiences with multidimensional poverty measurement.

The side event brought together an overflowing room of participants, among them many leading statisticians at the forefront of innovations in poverty measurement, to discuss and share experiences with using multidimensional poverty measures for analysing poverty and as a governance tool for targeting, monitoring, and coordination of poverty reduction programmes. 12 National heads of statistics addressed the audience.

Overall, the participants strongly highlighted the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) as a tool that can rigorously measure poverty in all its dimensions and fulfil SDG indicator 1.2.2.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02bb6280977.26382840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ophi.org.uk/un47sc-outcome/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Atkinson Commission report Launch 4 November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C654F6ED-A859-4F36-A722-63B7142C6349</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As the December workshop came in under budget due to some senior discussants from abroad participating by Skype, we used the ESRC funding to organise a high profile launch of the Atkinson Commission report to the Chief Ecomomist of the World Bank, Monitoring Global Poverty. the event was co-hosted with the Oxford Martin school which provided space.

In 2009, Mexico became the first country to launch an official national multidimensional poverty measure. Many other countries are in the process of developing multidimensional poverty measures.
OPHI provides extensive technical assistance to government technical staff, ministers and policymakers to support them in the development of their measures. OPHI's outreach work has included many seminars and hands-on training sessions, enabling them to build rigorous multidimensional poverty measures. 
OPHI acts as Secretariat for the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), a group of more than 50 governments and institutions that promotes the use of national multidimensional poverty measures.
The impact of the AF method extends well beyond national multidimensional poverty measures. In 2009-2010, OPHI worked with the Human Development Report Office at the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to construct a Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), a measure of acute poverty covering more than 100 developing countries, for UNDP's flagship Human Development Reports. OPHI has updated the Global MPI annually since 2010, and from Winter 2014/2015 has make updates twice a year. OPHI produces a wide range of policy briefings and web resources on the Global MPI, including an interactive databank.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F8EC9156-21B1-4E5F-A298-A7C3D6D92481</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9998379679.58978725</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A new method for measuring poverty, developed with the help of an ESRC-DFID grant, has been adopted by governments and organisations around the world to improve the effectiveness of poverty-reduction programmes. The AF method provides policymakers with a 'high-resolution lens' on individuals' lived experiences of poverty. By doing so, the method suggests real improvements in how poverty-reduction interventions are designed, implemented and monitored. Demand for the methodology has been so extensive that a global policy network has been created to provide support, advice, and 'South-South' learning opportunities for the policymakers using it.
Conscious that poverty is more than a lack of income, Dr Sabina Alkire and Professor James Foster developed the Alkire Foster (AF) method to capture the aspects of poverty that blight poor people's lives at the same time, such as poor health, lack of education and inadequate living standards. An AF measure reflects both the incidence of poverty (the percentage of people who are poor) and the intensity of poverty (the average percentage of dimensions in which poor people are deprived). This flexible method can incorporate context-specific variables, providing an at-a-glance poverty 'rating' which can be broken down to show who is poor - by gender, ethnicity or region - and how they are poor: which aspects of poverty they are experiencing.
Demand for AF measures has escalated in recent years and now far outstrips the capacity of the small OPHI team to meet it. In response, in June 2013, OPHI, together with the governments of Mexico and Colombia, launched the Multidimensional Poverty Peer Network (MPPN), an international network that connects senior policymakers exploring or implementing AF measures. The Network enables early adopters to share experiences of poverty measure design, political processes and institutional arrangements. Participants include countries as diverse as China, India, Nigeria, Morocco and Chile (a total of over 50 countries and institutions now participate).
OPHI was requested by members to host the Network Secretariat. In this central coordinating role, it pro-actively facilitates knowledge-sharing, convenes regular communications, and establishes working groups to take timely topics forward.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through the work of the MPPN we hope to continue to provide support and advice to countries developing and implementing national MPIs, as well as providing a strong coordinated voice for inclusion of multidimensional poverty analysis in the post-2015 SDGs.
Over the time of the grant we have run a two-week intensive summer schools (Beijing). These courses have provided methodological and practical training to high-calibre participants from across the world, who have in many cases have gone on to develop MPIs within their home countries or furthered research in the field. .
Following substantial interest generated by UNDP's release of the global MPI in 2010, plus growing awareness of the limitations of using income measures of poverty alone, OPHI has been invited to present in academic and policy forums around the world.
OPHI researchers have applied the AF method in academic studies, comparing their results with income poverty to show value-added. They developed methodologies for analysing poverty dynamics and robustness to changes in weights and other parameters. Their findings, published in journal articles and working papers, demonstrated how the AF method provides credible policy insights regarding the structure of poverty and how it varies between regions and groups of people, enabling policymakers to improve targeting, address interconnected aspects of poverty together cost-effectively, and monitor progress swiftly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A60F20B-2916-4F89-A9D8-5737418302AC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9ce92a8802.46520697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
