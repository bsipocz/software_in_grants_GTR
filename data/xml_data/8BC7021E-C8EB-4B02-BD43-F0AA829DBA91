Although different diseases have different patterns, in general they are all responsible for causing some damage to the retina at the back of the eye that gradually spreads and increases in magnitude reducing visual function gradually over time. Early diagnosis is therefore essential for saving as much of the retina as possible and preventing blindness. Obtaining images of the retina is one of the tools used by clinicians to assess the retinal health and diagnose disease; but good, detailed images are very hard to obtain for optical and biological reasons. Complex retinal imaging systems have been developed over the past couple of decades to obtain better images of the retina and improve the success rate of diagnosis. This project proposes a novel technique to image the living human retina based on a technology developed in microscopy. By illuminating the retina with patterned light instead of an even illumination and performing mathematical transformations to the images obtained, it is possible to get good quality three-dimensional images of the retina in a manner simpler than with existing techniques and providing images that are more faithful to the real retina. Such a technique will enable more accurate screening, owing to the better image quality, and also wider screening of the population, since simple low-costs instruments are more likely to be wide-spread to high-street optometry clinics than expensive instrumentation.The project will design and develop a first prototype using this novel technique after studying, both theoretically and experimentally, various possible configurations for this device. The prototype will be then tested on a group of volunteers to assess its performance and it will be compared with existing commercial retinal imaging instrumentation. Possibilities for commercial exploitation and clinical collaborations will be considered throughout the project. This work will provide an ideal 3-year training programme for a PhD student.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this work can be categorised into three distinct groups: (1) Industrial/commercial stakeholders (2) Public and private health care providers (3) The general public/patients The technology developed in this project will provide a novel retinal imaging system which provides high quality images (enabling accurate and early diagnosis) in a simple and inexpensive manner. For this reason it is expected that there will be considerable interest from industrial stakeholders in the retinal imaging field. It is one of the aims of this project to identify and protect intellectual property and seek collaborations from industry to develop this technology further. The PI has already collaborated with leading companies in retinal imaging and ophthalmic devices and is well placed to use these links or develop new ones. Further collaborative applications will be submitted within the lifetime of this project using results from the prototype developed as part of the project. In the longer term, the potential that this technology will offer in terms of providing wider access to eye screening will benefit public and private healthcare providers by enabling them to refer patients to treatments at an early stage of disease progression, thus reducing the incidence of blindness. The other beneficiaries of this are of course the patients themselves, many of whom will have an increased quality of life through earlier accurate diagnosis that can potentially save their sight. The Research and Enterprise team at the host institution, City University, will provide key support and facilities in pursuing paths that will lead to maximum impact from this research, such as assistance with patenting and setting up industrial collaborations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A patent has been filed (GB1018560.1) that discusses the innovation within this work, specifically the novel illumination methodology proposed for structured illumination and an implementation of such a method.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>EP/H017933/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>994DFD79-0982-4F6F-958C-D6807F8E0EFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A spin-out company has been formed with H2O Venture Partners and the technology has been licensed to the company, called Structured Eye Limited</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>m-881894352.735853276673aaa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>GB1018560.1</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Optical Imaging System</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2010</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The theory of this new retinal imaging technique has been studied and simulated on computer.
