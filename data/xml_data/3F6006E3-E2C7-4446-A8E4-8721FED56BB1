The infection is eliminated by T cells of the immune system which produce interferon-gamma, a protein that activates other cells, including infected cells, to kill Cryptosporidium. Another cell that produces interferon-gamma in sufficient quantities to kill microbes is the natural killer (NK) cell. Hosts that have poor T cell function, such as neonates or AIDS patients, may develop severe infection with Cryptosporidium and die. We studied this problem using a mutant mouse that, like the AIDS patient, is T cell-deficient but have NK cells. We found that the mutant mouse develops a chronic infection similar to that often observed in AIDS patients and is often fatal. Initially the mouse controls infection by producing interferon-gamma but, later, this production ceases and the mouse loses the ability to curb parasite multiplication. This suggests that early in infection NK cells provide partial but potent immunity but later the chronic infection causes NK cells either to disappear or malfunction. In this investigation, we will investigate in detail the role of NK cells in the control of chronic C. parvum infection in T cell deficient mice. Use will be made of different mutant strains of mice that have no T cells and either possess or do not possess NK cells. By comparing infection levels in these strains of mice it will be established whether NK cells are required for control of infection. NK cells will be isolated during infection to determine whether they are the source of interferon gamma. NK cells were originally named because of their capacity to directly kill tumour cells while in direct contact and we will determine whether they can also kill cells infected with C. parvum. The cells infected by C. parvum produce molecules that are known to activate NK cells and we will investigate whether NK cells isolated from the intestine and other organs can be activated in the presence of infected cells to produce interferon -gamma. Finally, to find out why mice eventually succumb to infection, intestinal cells will be isolated from mice at early and late stages of chronic infection and comparisons made of NK cell numbers and functionality. This study may lead to new therapies that allow NK cells to survive and maintain production of interferon-gamma during chronic infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Little is known about the nature of intestinal NK cell responses in immunity to infection of enterocytes by protozoan parasites. Cryptosporidium parvum infects enterocytes and causes cryptosporidiosis, an important diarrhoeal disease of humans and livestock. Elimination of infection requires CD4+ T cells in a Th1 response but we described an IFN-g-mediated innate immune response that initially controlled chronic infection in T and B cell deficient SCID mice. Neonatal SCID mice also survived a severe acute infection. Chronically infected mice eventually failed to express IFN-g and died, but the reason for this is unknown. The most likely source of IFN-g in innate immunity is NK cells and, in vitro, SCID mouse splenocytes stimulated with parasites produced IFN-g but only if NK cells were present. This project will characterise NK cell activities in innate immunity to C. parvum. Studies will employ T and B cell-deficient mice that may also be deficient in NK cells or IFN-g. Investigations with neonatal mice will determine if IFN-g-producing NK cells are responsible for the innate response that initially controls infection and whether NK cells can help to activate Th1 development that clears infection when T cells are transferred to the mice. In vitro studies with a murine enterocyte cell line that supports parasite development will assess whether NK cells have increased cytotoxicity when cells are infected and elucidate mechanisms that induce cytotoxicity. A further investigation will ascertain whether the proinflammatory phenotype of infected enterocytes directly induces NK cell cytokine production. It will be established whether the protective innate response during chronic infection is lost due to NK cell depletion or loss of functions such as IFN-g expression or cytotoxicity. The techniques employed include qPCR/ELISA for cytokine measurement and flow cytometry/confocal microscopy for characterising the phenotype of intestinal cells after isolation or in situ.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>442477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>505E5FA4-C69C-4158-901C-BA7050D15874</gtr:id><gtr:title>CD4+ T cells are not essential for control of early acute Cryptosporidium parvum infection in neonatal mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Infection and immunity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/abe96d18db4c115538bcad17de733e28"><gtr:id>abe96d18db4c115538bcad17de733e28</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korbel DS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0019-9567</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758ea4e94e6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE274C92-8261-4270-B9D4-A8334D4CC6C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>A protective role for interleukin 18 in interferon &amp;Icirc;&amp;sup3;-mediated innate immunity to Cryptosporidium parvum that is independent of natural killer cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of infectious diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/56b2d90eb469a207980b8ace0bd12b36"><gtr:id>56b2d90eb469a207980b8ace0bd12b36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Choudhry N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1899</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675d714273f4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F13F8E9-9981-4846-B766-8C64C009E0A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cryptosporidium parvum infection rapidly induces a protective innate immune response involving type I interferon.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of infectious diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c978cedf911afaf5d9610436e881a499"><gtr:id>c978cedf911afaf5d9610436e881a499</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barakat FM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1899</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758c85ec0ee</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F006179/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
