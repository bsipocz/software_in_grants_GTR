Specifically it will establish new reading groups in a total of ten targeted prisons, Youth Offender Institutions (YOIs) and secure hospitals across the UK and provide mentoring and support for prison personnel and volunteers to run them. This will be achieved through a partnership between Roehampton University and the Prisoners Education Trust.\n\nResearch shows that reading groups have particular benefits for prisoners and can play a useful role in rehabilitation. Literature provokes powerful personal responses. Reading groups provide a forum in which those responses can be tested out against the views of others, thus developing both emotional and critical intelligence. For prisoners especially, these are crucial objectives and are recognised as such by the Prison Service through its provision of cognitive skills and victim awareness courses in prisons throughout the country. \n\nEducation is widely recognised as central to rehabilitation. Reading groups improve the speaking and listening skills needed for work and social interaction both inside and outside prison. The learning that takes place in prison reading groups is informal but it can encourage and develop important study skills such as the discipline of sustained reading and thought outside the classroom. The experience can build self-confidence and become a stimulus to pursue formal education and training courses.\n\nReading groups are also a means of social inclusion and cohesion. By definition, prisoners are cut off from society. An important first step towards re-integration is the sense of having a stake in that society, a feeling of community with strangers. Reading groups not only provide the cultural capital of literature, but they can connect members to the wider culture outside through discussion of books, especially those being reviewed and talked about in the media.\n\nThe proposed Fellow and Co-Investigator surveyed and researched the whole field of reading groups in Britain and beyond. The results were published in Reading Groups (OUP, 2001). This is the only British study based on extensive survey data and it is widely recognised as the most authoritative. Since 1999 they have been closely involved in setting up and running groups in a range of prisons, including a women's prison and a YOI. They have also undertaken further research into the specific characteristics and benefits of prison reading groups. \n\nThe partnership between Roehampton University, The Prisoners Education Trust (the Trust) and the participating prisons will increase all the partners' understanding of the relationship between informal and formal learning in prisons, with respect to both experienced and emergent readers. It will provide the Trust with access to research on reading and book discussion, which can offer models of how personal response and critical awareness interact in the learning process. The partnership will enable the Fellow and Co-Investigator to draw on the Trust's expertise in prison education. It will also make access to prisons easier and provide better understanding of how to work most effectively with them.\n\nBoth the reading groups and the processes of knowledge transfer among the partners will be documented through participant reflection by both prisoners and facilitators, and formal evaluation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries will be the participating prisons and prisoners. However, the project is designed to have a much wider impact. The establishment of new groups across a large geographical area will create critical mass, which will extend awareness and encourage more groups to start. We will also publicise the project at the annual Prison Libraries Group conference and through the Prison Libraries Journal.\n\nRehabilitation is an essential area of prison policy. Reading groups address central elements of this process, especially the development of empathy and critical intelligence. They thus complement and extend the enhanced thinking skills and victim awareness courses run by all prisons. The proposed Fellow and Co-Investigator have already submitted a commissioned article to the Prison Service Journal, the professional journal for prison managers and policy-makers. The project will increase the evidence for the benefits of reading groups. The final report will bring this evidence to the attention of the prison service and encourage prisons to support the further spread of reading groups. \n\nPublic perception is a key influence on rehabilitation policy. The project enjoys the advantage of being centred on reading, an activity that tends to command more immediate public support than other arts-based initiatives. The project will increase public awareness of the benefits of reading groups in three ways: through the network of recruited volunteers; through the ongoing support of high-profile organisations such as English PEN and its member authors; and through talks and articles by the proposed Fellow and Co-Investigator. Audiences for the latter have been wide-ranging: academic and health professionals at Liverpool University's Reading and Health Day (2007); teachers and educational advisers eg London Association for the Teaching of English [LATE], National Association for the Teaching of English [NATE], National Association for Advisers in English [NAAE] (2007-9); reading groups and general readers (pieces in newbooks etc); talks at readers' days and literary festivals (eg Oxford, Dartington, Cheltenham). We will continue to publicise the work as widely as possible. We have also been consulted by the National Literacy Trust and the Reading Agency and are currently in discussion with the latter's research director, Debbie Hicks, about their new project, Reading and Health. \n\nThe project will enable Roehampton to further the aims of Crucible, the university's centre for education in human rights, social justice and citizenship (a Centre of Excellence in Teaching and Learning, funded by the Higher Education Funding Council). It will help Roehampton develop its contacts with a range of relevant voluntary sector organisations including the Shannon Trust, the Prison Reform Trust, Supporting Others Through Voluntary Action (SOVA), The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (NIACE), the Book Trust, and the Reading Agency. \n\nThe project will increase the mutual understanding among universities, prisons and the voluntary sector of the aims, structures and working methods of each. This will make future collaboration easier and more effective. Partnership with the Prisoners Education Trust will increase the university's understanding of how best to engage with prisons. For example, initial access is much easier through personal contacts; those developed by the project will be available to academic researchers at Roehampton and elsewhere. The academy and the voluntary sector have much to offer each other, in terms of both the development of practical projects, and in providing research evidence of the benefits of the work undertaken. The project will contribute substantially to this dialogue.\n\nAs outlined in the academic beneficiaries section of this application, the issues raised by the project cut across discip</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H016414/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
