(As) is a carcinogenic and toxic element. Natural contamination of drinking water with As is the main source of exposure to this element in many areas and is particularly prevalent in areas such as Bangladesh, West Bengal, and parts of China and the USA. Arsenic contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh and West Bengal has been described as the largest mass poisoning of a population in history, with millions of people affected. Rice is one of the main foods in As-epidemic areas and irrigation with As-contaminated water has resulted in rice with elevated levels of As. The European Food Safety Authority has called for As intake to be reduced. This can only be achieved with a better understanding of the pathways of As uptake and transport within rice plants and this is the aim of the first part of my project. This is a problem of genuine international significance that can only be addressed by an interdisciplinary approach.Wheat grain storage proteins are of immense importance in food processing as they form a viscoelastic network in dough trapping the carbon dioxide bubbles formed during sugar fermentation causing the dough to rise when baked. These proteins are deposited in the starchy endosperm region of the grain, which gives the white flour fraction on milling. However, the starchy endosperm is not a homogenous tissue, with clear gradients in the content and composition of starch, protein and cell wall polysaccharides. These gradients have implications for grain processing as they may allow the production of flour fractions with specific compositions and processing properties. However, they are also of fundamental interest in relation to understanding the control of endosperm development and the synthesis of the gluten proteins which determine the processing properties.This project will use NanoSIMS - state of the art high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry - to localise As in the nodes of rice plants, the point in the stem where solutes are split into two streams with one controlling uptake to the leaves and one to the rice grain. Several transporters controlling As uptake into the grain have been identified and I will be comparing the distribution of trace amounts of As at the nodes of wild type rice plants with mutants which are missing these specific transporter genes therefore blocking the uptake of As. In the second part of my project I will use the capability of the NanoSIMS to detect isotopes to investigate the distribution of proteins in developing wheat grains. Wheat plants will be fed with compounds used for nitrogen fertilisation which have been isotopically spiked with 15N. The plant is unable to distinguish naturally occurring 14N from 15N, which has a low natural abundance, therefore its distribution in the grain can be used to directly infer mechanisms of protein synthesis. This research will primarily be undertaken at the Department of Materials at Oxford University. This is a highly collaborative project and will involve scientists working in the fields of plant physiology, environmental science, crop nutrition and cereal grain structure and composition to develop new methodologies and improve understanding of the uptake and deposition of key elements in plants. Sample preparation of biological samples for SIMS analysis is difficult and complex. The Life Sciences department at Oxford Brookes University have a lot of expertise in preparing biological materials for TEM and, as we have discovered, NanoSIMS analysis. Samples will be grown at Rothamsted Research, prepared at Oxford Brookes University and the distributions of the key elements will be determined with the NanoSIMS in the Oxford Materials department. The strong collaborative links will be used to interpret these results to make an impact to the scientific knowledge in many aspects of plant science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Both projects outlined in this proposal will contribute new information to the scientific community and offer scientific advance in the fields of secondary ion mass spectrometry, plant nutrition and uptake mechanisms of important trace elements. The proposed research uses high resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry, traditionally a physical science technique, and applies it to 2 key biological problems showing how integrating existing techniques in the life sciences with advances in instrumentation in another discipline can provide new information in the fields of plant physiology, environmental science, crop nutrition and cereal grain structure and composition to develop new methodologies and improve understanding of the uptake and deposition of key elements in plants. The first part of my project focuses on understanding the mechanisms of uptake of As in rice plants with the aim of being able to reduce the As concentration in rice grains, a severe problem in areas such as Bangladesh. The immediate beneficiaries of this research will be those scientists who are working in this field with the research providing key data which either supports their theories or gives them key information to develop new ones. My previous research using the NanoSIMS has discovered several new and unexpected results in the subcellular distribution of metalloid elements and I am confident data from this new project will also have impact in both SIMS and plant science communities. Ultimately this research is aimed at helping the millions of people in South East Asia and other countries worldwide that are affected by As contaminated water by reducing the amount of As in rice grains and therefore improving their health and quality of life. Although a complete resolution of this problem is a long way off, this research will contribute information which could help researchers plan strategies to block As uptake before it enters the grain. The second part of my project is to investigate the deposition patterns of protein in wheat grain using isotopically spiked compounds. Again the immediate beneficiaries will be researchers in the areas of protein and wheat grain development as it will enable them to better understand these important yet poorly understood mechanisms. Nitrogen fertiliser is currently the major energy input to agriculture worldwide with major environmental as well as economic impacts, the current high yields and high protein contents required for breadmaking are not sustainable in terms of cost, energy requirement for fertiliser production and environmental footprint. Targeting applied nitrogen more effectively to optimise crop yield and quality is therefore a major goal for crop research worldwide. The bread industry is the second largest food sector with annual sales of 3 billion. Wheat grain storage proteins also play an important role in food processing ultimately controlling how well the bread rises by creating a viscoelastic network which traps carbon dioxide bubbles formed from the sugar fermentation. There is a strong gradient in protein concentration and distribution in the white bread part of the grain, the endosperm, and these gradients have implications for grain processing as they may allow the production of flour fractions with specific compositions and processing properties. The impact of the proposed research will be to provide the plant science and food processing industry with a more detailed mechanistic understanding of how to tailor growth and processing strategies for improved yield and manufacturing. I hope that my research will also benefit the general public by raising their awareness of the value of the research that is being undertaken at UK universities. This interdisciplinary project is very approachable by the general public, as I have discovered during my current research, as is work that they can relate to because these problems directly affect human lives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rothamsted Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rothamsted Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C4B8708-F6CA-4EB5-B665-714C1D8DA7AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many publications, research talks and future collaborations

Ultimately it is hoped that the arsenic related research will help towards breeding cultivars or developing mutants that can block arsenic entering the rice grain and therefore minimise arsenic intake in humans in areas such as Bangladesh, India and China. 

The findings from the wheat grain research will hopefully allow wheat breeders to develop cultivars with specific protein properties and hence produce flours with specific compositions and processing properties. This could result in improvements in bread production and nutritional quality and lead to significant cost savings or an increase in revenue.</gtr:description><gtr:id>65259927-48B1-4BD0-A631-6331DF726D1C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54589ea558d383.80254847</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has demonstrated the capability for physical science techniques to be successfully applied to analytical challenges in plant science and investigate key problems at the nanoscale. The main analytical technique used was the NanoSIMS, high spatial resolution chemical mapping with very good sensitivity to low concentrations. The main areas of research were to investigate arsenic distributions in rice plants, specifically the node and stem, and protein deposition in wheat grain. 

To determine arsenic distributions in the relatively large node samples it was important to be able to map over a range of length scales so complementary synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (S-XRF) was used as well as NanoSIMS. A methodology was developed to allow analysis of the same sample in both techniques as both required different sample preparation. A microtome was used to create adjacent sections allowing essentially the same cells to be investigated. Results showed excellent correlation between the two techniques. 
This research showed for the first time the detailed distribution of arsenic in the node and stem of rice plants and correlated it to important macro and other trace elements. Vacuolar storage was a common feature responsible for the strong localization in specific cell types, although Cu and Si were localised in some cell walls. Strong co-localization of As with S and Fe with P in specific cells also provided important clues to the detoxification mechanisms for these elements. The distribution of these elements are highly heterogeneous, implying different storage capacities and/or different functions in trace element homeostasis among different cell types. Sequestration of arsenic in companion cell vacuoles in the node may explain the limited phloem mobility of arsenite. The distribution patterns observed should aid future research into the investigation of cell type-specific expression patterns of responsible genes. This research was published in New Phytologist in 2014.
The other half of this research was concerned with understanding protein development and deposition in wheat grains. Even though wheat grain proteins are vitally important in the food processing industry very little is known about how and when they are formed and why there are gradients in the composition and amount across the wheat grain. Complementary techniques were also used to investigate this, in this case NanoSIMS and antibody labelling, on adjacent sections cut with a microtome. To determine temporal variations in protein deposition 15N labelled glutamine was injected into the ears of wheat plants and they were allowed to grow for up to a week after labelling. The 15N labelling marked the locations of actively growing protein and the intensity of the labelling indicated how active that part of the grain was. Antibody labelling was used to give information such as protein type and molecular weight. This project was challenging in terms of acquiring enough NanoSIMS data to be statistically significant and correlating the NanoSIMS and antibody labelling images was very difficult. This research was published in the Plant Biotechnology Journal in February 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research mainly has impact in academia, it is not clear at this point that there will be any directly exploitable results that can be turned into intellectual property. My arsenic research has already been used by other researchers to understand elemental uptake into rice and infer the mechanisms of specific transporters. Ultimately it is hoped that my research will contribute towards the breeding of cultivars or development of mutants that can block arsenic entering the rice grain and therefore minimise arsenic intake in humans. With regards to the wheat grain research it is hoped that understanding how the gradients in protein composition and content arise will allow for the production of flours with specific compositions and processing properties. This could result in improvements in bread production and nutritional quality. In this project I have also developed a methodology to allow complementary analysis of the same sample with many techniques requiring different sample preparation (e.g. synchrotron and NanoSIMS) and this information will be of general use to the NanoSIMS and plant science communities. Working with my collaborators I will continue to take this research forward into new areas of plant science even though my fellowship has now ended.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>95F7ACA6-ABA1-438F-B428-024381292F22</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453a79a549f08.87375449</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B4B316AB-FC45-447E-840A-7AB9A1C9B209</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rough and tough.
