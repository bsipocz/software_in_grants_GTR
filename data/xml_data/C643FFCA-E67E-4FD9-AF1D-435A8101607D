Studying children's growth pattern (velocity of growth and shape of the growth curve) rather than their height at a specific age is a significant methodological innovation. Adaptive theories of human development and growth stress how exposure to poor nutrition or disease, especially in utero, does not merely affect the child's current height but also the timing of the pubertal growth spurt, their velocity of growth and the length of the growing period: in other words, their growth pattern. This project will extend existing knowledge of children's growth in Britain in three ways: first, by reconstructing boys' longitudinal growth measurements from training ship records spanning the century and a half from 1865 onwards; second, by producing and analysing new growth profiles from historical sources; and third, by placing the change in Britain's growth pattern in international context using growth profiles (the average height and weight of children across a number of ages) collected from 1850 to the present from around the world.

Four new datasets will be produced and deposited in the UK Data Archive as a part of the project: three individual-level datasets with the heights and weights of children and a dataset with growth profiles for a wide range of countries around the world from 1850 to the present.

The data produced will supply a longer-run perspective on the immediate and intergenerational factors influencing children's growth patterns in Britain and internationally and indicate how the shift from an unhealthy to healthy growth pattern took place. The data will also assemble new evidence on historical BMI growth curves and child obesity rates, providing historical context for the current child obesity crisis. The project's findings are particularly relevant to the current discussion about a post-2015 development framework to replace the Millennium Development Goals and to understanding the childhood obesity crisis and will inform health interventions and development policy goals for improving the health of children in both the developing and developed worlds. 

I am uniquely suited to carry out this research because I have conducted extensive research on historical children's growth and understand the potential problems that surround these data (Schneider, 2013a, 2013b). I have also developed substantial knowledge on the biology of human growth, allowing me to bring a necessary interdisciplinary approach to the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Beneficiaries

As mentioned above, there will be academic beneficiaries to this research beyond the narrow fields of anthropometric history and auxology, the study of human growth. First, the results will inform debates in development studies about the persistence of stunting in India and more generally how health and malnutrition indicators can remain stagnant during periods of economic growth and wage increases. Second, the project will be of interest to historians and economic historians interested in placing broader social and economic changes within the framework of changing health over the past 150 years. Third, future researchers will use the datasets produced to answer questions beyond the original scope covered in this project. Individuals in the datasets can be linked across sources to analyse different topics such as social mobility and the influence of growth on later life outcomes. Finally, the interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide a strong example of the benefits of using the newest theories in human biology to interpret historical data. The advisory committee meetings and the one-day workshop at the end of the grant will also help establish new networks and collaborations between development economists, economic historians and human biologists.

National Policy Makers

National policy makers such as politicians and civil servants in the Department of Health and the Department of Education will benefit from the results of this project because it will provide long-term historical context to the current child obesity crisis. Children's weight-for-age and BMI-for-age growth profiles have not been constant over time. Evidence from one poor law school in the early twentieth century (along with other BMI-for-age growth profiles) suggests that the BMI growth curve may have changed substantially over the past 100 years (Schneider, 2013b). Thus, this project will identify when the modern BMI growth curve appeared and what factors have led to shifts in the BMI growth curve. These factors will inform policy interventions targeted at reducing childhood obesity today.

International Policy Makers

International policy makers will also benefit from this research. From a current policy perspective, it is useful to understand which immediate and long-term (intergenerational) factors helped transform children's growth from an unhealthy to healthy growth pattern in developed countries and how this occurred. Thus, understanding the British health transition may yield insights into the progress that different developing countries have made in their own health transition, barriers preventing childhood stunting from improving, and appropriate growth-related indicators for measuring progress in the future. This information would help governments and NGOs in the developing world focus their health interventions more effectively. It would also help international policy makers set realistic development targets and policy implementation plans for the post-2015 development framework. This study will be especially important if childhood stunting, underweight and obesity are added as nutrition indicators in the post-2015 development framework.

Public

As the recent press coverage of Tim Hatton's paper (2013) has shown, there is substantial media and public interest in the secular increase in height and by extension the change in children's growth pattern over the last 150 years. Thus, I will seek to engage with the public and the media by designing a branded website, writing quarterly blog posts for non-specialist audiences and writing press releases about my working papers.

I will also engage with historical societies with a particular interest in training ships in order to disseminate the historical aspects of the research. Thus, I will present preliminary results to the Indefatigable Old Boys Club, the Liverpool Nautical Society, and the Marine Society charity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with School Children</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1081687-6314-4FDA-A76D-E7CA11E16737</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I spoke to approximately 30 children at Churchfields Primary School in Bromley about what life was like for children in the Victorian era. I also had them measure their own heights and compare their heights with British children who went to a school just down the road in the 1870s (data collected as a part of the project). The children found this very interesting and it was a good way to engage them about how the health of individuals has changed over time. This was a small-scale effort, but I am now seeing whether a lesson plan could be developed and systematically disseminated to teachers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9a535f03a2.06145336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog Posts on Project Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2A136C6A-4149-4D77-98B4-707CEDEEC46B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have been writing a periodic blog post, which has explained the foundation for the project, provided updates on data collection and visualized the data in interesting ways for the public.
