This shift in emphasis from 'top-down' direct government, to 'bottom-up' stakeholder engagement is particularly pronounced in managing risks to critical infrastructure and the environment.

Current methodologies and tools, such as surveys and stakeholder focus groups, aimed at consultation with stakeholder organisations and citizens are however generally limited in scope and insufficiently open or adaptive. Thus, they do not effectively inform the complex planning processes underlying comprehensive, multi-faceted infrastructure development planning as undertaken for example in the Thames Estuary. In order to inform and reconcile planning approaches to heterogeneous challenges such as environmental risk protection, economic viability (e.g., fisheries) and ecosystem management, new consultation methods and novel ways of combining multi-stakeholder views with quantitative data are urgently needed.

The Thames Estuary Partnership (TEP) and its partners are facing the challenge of stakeholder integration in the planning of imminent, major infrastructural development in the context of large scale projects in the areas of pollution (sewers), flood protection and ecosystem management. 
This project is designed to leverage, apply and evaluate - in the Thames Estuary Infrastructure context, cutting edge methodologies and software tools for value-based, data-driven planning methods developed and tested as part of the recent, interdisciplinary EPSRC funded project &amp;quot;Towards Data-Driven Environmental Policy Design&amp;quot; (TDDEPD). 
Building on novel developments in human data capture and computer science, these techniques enable the rapid and comprehensive capture of qualitative data; e.g., stakeholder opinion and their integration with quantitative data sources such as sensor measurements (e.g., rainfall levels) and process outputs. 
While these planning methodologies were developed in a very different topical (i.e. environmental protection planning) and geographic (Western Australian wetlands) context, this project will explore their adaptation and application to the context of infrastructural planning in the Thames Estuary. In order to establish their viability, the project brings together an exceptional team, led by the TEP and including the Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute and School of Computer Science from the University of Nottingham (Horizon) and integrating key expertise in planning contributed (as an in-kind contribution) by the Department for Parks and Wildlife by the Western Australian Government.

The ambitious project will deliver a novel value-driven methodology for infrastructure planning, including an adapted framework for stakeholder engagement. A digital platform enabling the capture and processing of both stakeholder input and (often uncertain) quantitative data (e.g., water levels) will be developed and will provide essential management support tools such as sensitivity analyses for potential infrastructure changes. The latter will also directly support the evaluation of the proposed approach and will enable addressing a concrete use case within the project time frame (Clean Seas Please). 

TEP believe that a values-based approach to managing infrastructure, risk, and habitat creation will be the only effective way forward. They believe that using the methods to be developed in this work by a team with a strong track record and significant expertise will transform the way they interact with those to whom they are responsible at the levels of policy setting, and policy implementation and will enable the comprehensive planning and development of infrastructure in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39853</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In this project, the usefulness of applying the Values-based Decision Framework, initially developed for conservation management in Western Australia, has been explored more widely in the context of infrastructure planning and management in the UK Thames Estuary.

Building on that work, this research project is developed to explore the usefulness of this novel framework for planning infrastructure management within the Thames estuary. 

In order to achieve this, the project focused both on new methodological challenges (such as the combination of abiotic elements, e.g., flood defences, with biotic elements) and a more comprehensive engagement with local stakeholders who hold insights into the priorities and extremely complex challenges of managing the estuary. 

Through four comprehensive workshops, Thames Estuary stakeholders and experts from the Thames Estuary Partnership (TEP), and researchers from the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and the University of Nottingham (UoN) were brought together. As a result, the framework has been re-developed to fit the new context.

Based on results achieved, plus the very positive stakeholder and expert feedback, we are confident that the framework has the potential to contribute very positively to the management of complex multi-stakeholder systems, such as the Thames Estuary.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It was clear from the progress made, the information achieved and the positive responses of stakeholders and experts that the developed Framework could make a useful contribution to infrastructure and environmental planning in the Thames Estuary and beyond, provided sufficient resources are made available. 

Since the project has shown such scalability of the developed framework and the developed information processing tools, the experiences, methodologies and tools can be used by other environmental policy makers in other UK/non-UK contexts.
