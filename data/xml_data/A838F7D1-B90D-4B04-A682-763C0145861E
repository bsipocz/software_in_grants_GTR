Questions have been asked about the possible impact of more women judges and, in particular, how the introduction of women's lived experience and feminist theoretical perspectives might affect the development of the common law and the interpretation of key statutes. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Feminist Judgments Project represents a timely, dynamic and innovative next step in this debate. The project is a unique, imaginative collaboration in which a group of feminist socio-legal scholars will write alternative feminist judgments in significant legal cases. Thus, rather than simply critiquing existing judgments, the participants will engage in a practical, 'real world' exercise of judgment-writing, subject to the various constraints that bind appellate judges, including consideration of the extent to which, and the form in which, a judge's political commitments and social experience may or may not be introduced into her decision-making.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will inaugurate a new form of critical socio-legal scholarship, one which seeks to demonstrate in a sustained and disciplined way how judgments could have been written and cases could have been decided differently.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56161</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research-Led Teaching: How Does it Impact on Students?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>061AB721-3E6C-4A94-B99D-06D92C8EBF16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited presentation to an Away Day for the Law Department, University of Middlesex.

Methodologically, we have explored the extent to which appellate judgment-writing is open to the introduction of feminist perspectives, and have concluded that feminist judging is not only possible within the judicial constraints of independence, impartiality, fairness, consistency and certainty, but can provide a more satisfactory way of meeting these requirements. We have identified a distinctively feminist approach to judgment-writing, and examined its similarities to and differences from other approaches. Feminist judgments, like all others, must be based on the application of legal reasoning to the facts of the case, but the way the facts are understood and the choices made about legal relevance, categorisation and interpretation may be different. In particular, feminist judges may be more inclined to refer to social science research literature and policy reports in order to place the issues in the case within their broader context. We have also found that in many cases, there is no singular feminist position available on the issues raised by a case; rather, those taking different feminist theoretical approaches may arrive at different decisions. At the same time, it is clear that a feminist judge may not always be able to reach the result she might prefer within the bounds of the judicial role. 



Substantively, the cases and commentaries produced by the project show how the particular feminist approach adopted by the judgment writer 'makes a difference' in the specific cases chosen for analysis. The commentaries also describe how the feminist judgment differs from and adds to the existing judgments in each case. In a number of the cases, the feminist judgment agrees with the original outcome, but reaches that result by quite a different route. These judgments underline the discursive power of law and show that for the wider audience beyond the immediate parties to the case, the reasoning adopted in the judgment is at least as important as the result. The cases also highlight some of the limitations of individual litigation and available legal remedies to address wider social issues.



Finally, we have found that if the imagined feminist judgments had really been made, they would have had wide-ranging material, policy and discursive implications. The judgments demonstrate very clearly the contingency and lack of inevitably of the decisions actually made in these cases, the kinds of biases and habitual modes of thought embedded within the existing common law, the extent to which women's experiences and concerns continue to be poorly reflected in law, and the kinds of changes that would need to be made to remedy this situation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF4FBD2F-31EA-4928-AAE9-8FB88325FBB1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2180735740.978956b2f10c9a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services/ and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.feministjudgments.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9F815DE6-5756-49F8-B22B-0F1FCDF70294</gtr:id><gtr:title>More Than Just a Different Face?
