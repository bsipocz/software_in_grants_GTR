Pacific, and its future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J008494/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Britain was one of the most significant sources of missionaries to Africa and the Pacific during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. While histories of missionary activity are matters of ongoing importance in these now strongly Christian parts of the world, attitudes to Christianity in Britain, and its history of missionary activity are increasingly ambivalent. However, a great deal of material heritage associated with early missionary encounters remains in Britain, where it is widely neglected. This material includes:

* items collected as evidence of pre-Christian religious practices, many of which are now regarded as rare and major works of art
* gifts received by missionaries from local people
* the personal possessions and portraits of famous missionaries
* relics of the ships used by missionaries to reach their destinations 
* material, such as collecting boxes, that were used to appeal to supporters in Britain

This project aims to create a conversation between academics, museum curators and representatives of missionary societies, as well as heritage organizations in Africa and the Pacific to establish who cares about this heritage in the present, and who should care for it in the future.

Three workshops will be held during 2012 at the National Museum of Scotland, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich. The project is a partnership between researchers at these three organizations, as well as the Museum Ethnographers Group, a charity that exists to 'Make connections through world collections'. As a recognized 'Subject-Specialist Network' in the museum's sector, the Museum Ethnographers Group will use its connections to influence museum practice in relation to the cataloging, conservation and exhibition of collections of missionary material.

Each of the workshops will include a presentation by an international academic researcher, as well as by knowledgeable museum curators and missionary organisations about their experiences of working with missionary material. These presentations will be the starting points for a series of structured conversations about the future of collections of missionary material in Britain, and the best ways of making them available for study by international researchers, as well as those in Britain and overseas for whom they have a significant value as items of heritage.

The National Museum of Scotland will be opening an exhibition on the life and legacy of the famous missionary David Livingstone towards the end of this project, organized in collaboration with colleagues from Museums of Malawi in Africa. We expect the opening of this exhibition to be an important moment when the conversations that begin during these workshops can receive a more public airing in the media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Both the Principal Investigator and the Co-Investigator have experience of working on projects that have achieved a considerable range of impacts. With experience in academic research as well as curatorial practice, we are keenly aware of the potential of the insights and perspectives developed during research to benefit practitioners in a range of sectors. The workshops and outcomes will be of direct benefit to a range of researchers in mission studies, museum studies and Pacific and African studies, notably art historians, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and museum curators. 

By working in partnership with the Museum Ethnographers Group (MEG) we will engage with those with curatorial responsibility for missionary collections in a range of UK institutions, from national and university museums, to local authority and small independent museums. We will assist them to make effective use of these collections, which should generate new research and exhibitions with the potential to generate significant economic impact in a range of locales.

By including policy makers from British and international bodies we hope to draw attention to the significance of missionary heritage as a unique resource in Britain, the presence of which deserves to be supported. Failure to recognise the potential significance of such material allowed the disposal of the George Brown collection in 1985, because it was not understood as a significant part of British heritage, and its acquisition by the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan. 

By engaging with and involving representatives of missionary societies with ongoing responsibilities for the stewardship of material heritage that has accumulated during their long histories, we hope to provide significant assistance to administrative officers in the development of effective policies for the management of these resources, so that they can be effectively curated and made effective use of. By involving representatives of heritage organisations in Africa and the Pacific, we hope to develop international bonds of collaboration and share expertise with colleagues working in these parts of the world. 

We also plan to engage the wider public through targeted media engagements, timed to coincide with the opening of the David Livingstone exhibition in Edinburgh. We hope to initiate a wider conversation about the significance of the material heritage of British missions for British, diasporic and overseas communities.

As well as short-term impacts generated during the project, the range of planned engagements has the potential to generate a significant economic impact over the medium to longer term by drawing attention to the unique and significant potential of an under-appreciated and under-utilised resource in the United Kingdom and by generating a range of new activity around this. 

We expect to increase the effectiveness of museums as public services through the ways in which they document, conserve and display collections. We also hope to influence the activity of heritage policy bodies, and assist them in the appropriate targeting of resources, by recognising the various constituencies with a stake in Britain's missionary heritage. 

By engaging the wider public in a conversation about the historic significance of the missionary endeavour, and its material heritage in Britain, we hope to contribute to the mutual understanding of different groups of people within Britain, as well as a better appreciation of Britain's historic role in shaping the modern world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33133</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'David Livingstone.

Even though it was mainly set up for other academics, the listserv has attracted interest from outside academia and sparked broader and interesting discussions than anticipated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7061651588.4750070cbcd4ba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 1 - Africa focus</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6897C97-BBEE-4D90-A54C-F4D596FE15AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised three workshops. During each workshop it was important to invite a wide interest group. The involvement of curators from a range of institutions enabled them to make more effective use of their collections of missionary material. By including policy makers we drew attention to the significance of missionary heritage as a unique resource in Britain, the presence of which deserves to be recognised and supported both nationally and internationally. Failure to recognise the potential significance of such material enabled the sale of the collection of the Methodist missionary George Brown in 1985, and its acquisition by the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan. We invited representatives of the main UK-based missionary societies, who contributed insightfully to the discussions. The first workshop held in Edinburgh on 27-28 November 2012, was timed to coincide with the opening of the Dr Livingstone, I Presume? exhibition,4 and had a focus on Africa. The keynote speakers during the workshop were Sarah Worden, of National Museums Scotland, who curated the Livingstone exhibition, and Friday Mufuzi, Curator of History at the Livingstone Museum in Zambia. Tamanda Mthotha, who was in Edinburgh at the time as part of a partnership that has been established between National Museums of Malawi and National Museums Scotland, also attended the workshop and contributed to the discussions.

The workshop informed the following workshop in Cambridge and led to the general outputs and side-projects reported elsewhere. This particular workshop also led to an exhibition in Malawi, reported separately.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462158f7ee4b9.77733771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 2 - UK/Collections focus</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F68AC8A-6468-4992-81B0-C8A9B2B16536</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See general information on the workshops in 'Workshop 1'. The second workshop, held in Cambridge on 22-23 March 2013, had a focus on Britain, and the significance and fate of material deriving from the history of missionary encounters. The keynote speakers were David Maxwell (Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge), Rosemary Seton (Research Associate and former Head of Archives and Special Collections at SOAS), and the Reverend Ben Wate (of the Anglican Church of Melanesia). Maxwell's presentation made it clear that much of the material that was collected and transported to Britain was the result of a common enterprise, rather than one that was entirely directed by the interests of European missionaries. Seton spoke about her experience of developing Mundus, the online reference tool for locating missionary archives. Unsurprisingly, her talk led to a discussion about the possibility of developing, as a possible outcome of the networking project, something similar that would function as a directory to missionary-related artefacts in museum collections This developed into an interesting discussion about ownership and the ethics of making such material public. Who, for example, decides whether or not it is appropriate to publish the large missionary photographic collections, much of which might dwell on pre-Christian practices, with which Christians in Africa and the Pacific today might not want to be associated? Wate pointed out that even today many children in the Solomon Islands are named after early British missionaries. He also highlighted the continuing spiritual potency associated with the relics of John Patteson, the first Anglican Bishop of Melanesia, martyred at Nukapu in the Solomon Islands in 1871, which are kept in the Anglican Cathedral at Honiara. It was clear that these relics were more evocative for many Solomon Islanders than the ethnographic materials collected by other missionaries that are now in European museums.

The workshop informed the third workshop and led to the general outputs and side projects reported elsewhere.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546216339ba0f6.32048897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>17626</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of East Anglia</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>33BAD4E3-2AEF-4A97-A98B-88573D9B34CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee24fb65ee24fca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Conference and Travel grant - Mc Donald Institute for Archaeological Research</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Cambridge</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E2E9D44D-7D21-45AA-A3F7-00083CB2A1E6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5458c52f837bd3.80121468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The main idea was to form a network of various stakeholders: academics, museum curators, representatives of heritage and missionary societies and African and Pacific stakeholders. Through the relatively open structure of the workshops, we encouraged interactions between these different parties. This means that research findings have been and will be used in a variety of ways. One publication was written for a clear academic audience, one for a museum curators audience and one for the general public. Discussions during the workshop led to an exhibition in Malawi, to a new display in the Fiji Museum and led to an international conference on missionary heritage. Discussions also resulted in a funding application for a larger research project, which was unsuccessful but was the basis for an even stronger and wider network of colleagues with shared interests. These are actual and tangible projects. However, curators of smaller museums in the UK who look after missionary collections have reported that they now think differently about these collections and acknowledge the complexity of their nature. Indirectly, this will influence the way curators deal with these collections in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C55202D3-16A7-45F7-81D5-82DAE09A6850</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546219aa5ec2c8.26480841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to set up a network of academics, museum curators, representatives of missionary organisations and heritage groups, and African and Pacific stakeholders to discuss the stewardship of the material heritage resulting from two centuries of British missionary work in Africa and the Pacific. During three workshops we worked with a core group of participants and asked the question 'Who cares?' for and about this material in the present, and who is likely to care most about it in the future. The variety of perspectives that came up during the keynote presentations and discussions were eye-opening. What became clear from all the discussions over the three workshops is that a great many people do care. Christians in Africa and the Pacific may care because material was associated with significant events in their history. Indigenous activists may care because some missionary collected material offers the best opportunity for reconstructing pre-Christian practices. Agnostic British people may care because they feel that this material represents a history of which they are faintly embarrassed. The issue seems not to be whether anyone cares, but whether the ways in which people care makes it difficult for them to find a way of talking to and understanding each other. We concluded that the way forward was to highlight the potential of missionary heritage to become a focus for reflections on shared histories by people from different parts of the world, with the attendant ambiguities and complexities that this involves. This project was timely because museums across the UK as well as elsewhere in Europe are reconsidering the significance of 'ethnographic' collections as 'world cultures'. The latter rubric may diminish the historical significance of the materials in question. Tangible outcomes of the project have been: three publications, an exhibition in Malawi, a future new display in Fiji, but, most of all, a network of specialists have been formed who have already organised an international conference and look forward to continuing collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A very successful network of specialists was formed. Not only did the network meet during the workshops and everyone contributed to a publication, smaller collaborations have been formed between network participants. One important side project has been an exhibition in Malawi, another has been the planning of a new missionary display in the Fiji museum in Fiji. Many of the network participants participated in a larger scale conference held in Cambridge in September 2014, which was organised by the core team that organised the workshops for the networking grant. There, network participants were able to widen their network and some spin-off projects have been started. In South Africa, people are currently preparing a publication. The P-I, together with people who participated in the network workshops, is currently putting together a proposal for a larger project. These are actual and tangible projects. However, participants working in museums have reported that they now think differently about missionary collections. This might indirectly influence the way curators deal with these collections in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A32058D1-1342-473B-B6D5-4DB4A17CE8A0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461d73d4f8987.36933551</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.museumethnographersgroup.org.uk/en/projects/330-ahrc-network.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1FB249E5-AF6D-4892-BF06-FA72A9A21995</gtr:id><gtr:title>Trophies, relics and curios?
