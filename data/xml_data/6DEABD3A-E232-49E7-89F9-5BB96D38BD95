This proposed studentship is specifically aimed at this objective but also takes the 'next step' in the assessment of these spatial data, by investigating how to use maps of marine mammal distribution and abundance to inform policy decisions, namely the development of offshore marine protected areas (MPAs). The development of offshore MPAs is increasingly advocated, particularly with the increasing demands on the marine environment, most recently due to marine renewable energy sources. However, there are currently few guidelines available as to how to base decisions on location, let alone size, and spacing of such protected areas. Different criteria are often suggested to guide the design of reserves but problems could be foreseen with many of these. For example, identifying MPAs based on hotspots of animal use might give priority to commoner species and neglect those that are of most concern (endangered or threatened species). Similarly, identifying MPAs based on high biodiversity (areas where the most species are found) may suggest protecting areas where species overlap, but due to avoidance between these species, these may be at the boundaries of their ranges and therefore represent only marginal habitat for them. Conducted in collaboration with the Sea Mammal Research Unit, this studentship will use their datasets on the distribution and abundance of seals and whales in UK offshore waters. This project aims to develop an ecologically-based computer framework for the design of offshore MPAs for marine mammals around Britain based on quantitative objectives, with the broader aim of providing a generic framework that can be used in other areas and for other species. Aims and Objectives: 1) To develop a model framework for the objective identification and design of offshore MPAs based on ecological first principles; 2) To inform the model with analysis of existing data on the abundance and distribution of marine mammals and human activities around Britain; 3) To investigate the impact of a range of different objectives and constraints on the resulting selections of MPAs; 4) To develop objective criteria that could ultimately be used to advise national and international policy on marine protected areas for wide ranging marine mammals. Potential Application and Benefits: The primary outcome of this project will be the assessment of priorities and constraints for offshore MPA design for marine mammals. This will be of primary interest to policy-makers and the major project deliverable to this community will be software for use in dynamic ongoing assessment and prioritisation of areas based on updates for species maps, population estimates and variations in anthropogenic risk. This software will also lend itself well to public exhibition, illustrating how management of the open ocean can be achieved. Within the Oceans 2025 community, this work is also likely to be of interest to the Sustainable Marine Resources theme, particularly elements concerning marine spatial planning and analysis of marine policy drivers to enhance decision-support. We aim to forge links with these researchers, and to feed the data and outcomes associated with this project into this broader analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>67925</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/F012357/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
