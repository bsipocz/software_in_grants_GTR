The research aims to have reach and significance in its field, and will have a wide variety of beneficiaries, who are listed below:

Academic community
The academic community interested in sustainable SCM research will benefit from the field being advanced by the findings. These will be communicated through Conference papers for EUROMA, IPSERA and AOM, and journal papers for JPSM, IJOPM. 

Cardiff Business School
The Logistics and Operations Management (LOM) section where the Fellow will be based, the Business School and the ESRC funded BRASS centre will benefit from the wider programme development in this relatively new area of research for the University, and specifically the new perspectives provided by the research on sustainable SCM. The research will also be incorporated in teaching and learning, and will benefit undergraduate, postgraduate and executive education students.

Participating organisations
The research explores how to improve performance and efficiency in the supply chain, improve competitiveness of the organisations, and impact on the triple bottom line of sustainability. The research activity itself will therefore contribute to commercial practice. The organisations participating in the research will be provided with feedback from the research, as a means to improve sustainable SCM and organisational performance. Participants will be invited to a workshop, to feedback lessons learnt and to ensure knowledge exchange. We will also collect 'before' and 'after' data to assess improvements in performance following the study, as a means of assessing the impact of the research along the supply chain

Practitioner community
Recent studies have shown that sustainability is rising on the agenda of CEOs (Posner, 2009), and is of increasing concern to purchasing supplier managers (Hopkins et al., 2009). The findings of this project will inform the purchasing and supply practitioner community of how to balance a profitable supply chain with sustainability concerns, which is increasingly important to them. We will share the findings of our research through practitioner journals such as 'Chief Procurement Officer' and 'Supply Management', to ensure the findings reach as many practitioners as possible. 

BRASS research partners
The findings will be disseminated through the ESRC Research Centre on Business Relationships Accountability, Sustainability and Society (BRASS). BRASS has a variety of research partners. We will disseminate the findings to these research partners via newsletters and seminars.

Broader community
The research investigates how sustainability benefits are experienced along the supply chains of participating organisations, contributing to quality of life for employees, organisations and communities, who will benefit from reduced environmental impacts, improved social impacts, and improved economic performance in the supply chains. We will co-produce summaries of the research with the participating organisations, that they can share on their websites, with their employees, and with the communities they are situated in

Policy makers
The research will also result in practitioner and policy guidance to feed into the DEFRA sustainable procurement policy group (the government lead department on sustainable SCM), the British Standard Committee on Sustainable Procurement, and the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply. All these organisations give guidance to purchasing and supplies managers on sustainable SCM, and our research can contribute to future policy iterations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>B.A.M.

Of two main forms of decision analysis, 'alternatives-based' and 'values-focussed', the former is subject to greater formal study, yet is dependent on performance attributes. Relationship attributes remain largely phenomenological, yet relationship management is central to supply chain management, and sustainable development prompts increased need for collaboration, so better understanding of relationships will aid success. Stakeholder theory, systems theory and service-dominant logic are examined for potential theory development. The talk was very well attended and followed by an engaged discussion including from senior academics present.

Relationships with a number of international academics were established as a result of conversations held as a result of the talk.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8633559279.7338582b188d08</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ipsera.com/event-1778201</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Newton Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4ADA5BE8-169F-43F2-B749-A8F2F86C1097</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e1fe9fee67.34701056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Strategic Impact Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1A3A7587-9302-458D-AD20-99C06CDBDC24</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d58bde44da63.42461181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>25000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Professor Roger Mansfield Research Fellowship Prize</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Cardiff University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2D11B4BD-62B5-495A-8994-D111A1D7098A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d58c45aaada2.56784626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research outputs have been presented and well received at various conferences. To date on paper has been published in Supply Chain Management: An International Journal (an ABS3* journal) with another under review in the Strategic Management Journal (ABS 4*) with more papers being written at present. A research seminar bringing together experts from relevant disciplines (maths, psychology and business) was organised in December 2014 (Cardiff), and results were also presented to the British Academy of Management Responsible Leadership symposium in May 2015 (London) and the British Academy of Management workshop on inter-organisational relationships for sustainability also in May 2015 (Coventry). To date a small number of references to the work published so far have been found in other publications and conference papers. It is too early to point to other applications of the research by practitioners as the final results are not yet communicated to these groups.
However, the nature of the subject is fundamentally about improving economic performance and beneficial societal impact and so it is hoped that a very strong application of these ideas will be delivered in the near future. Notably, the addressing of drivers and barriers for climate change mitigation via agricultural practices and fossil-based energy consumption are noteworthy output of the research. Other social challenges relating to the use of conflict minerals and biodiversity loss are also addressed. In addition, a short feature on the topic was published in the ESRC Britain in 2016 magazine.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92CF4172-C0D6-4F16-B486-3805AA5B9769</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5452af82cce267.67440292</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As sustainable supply chain management is a relatively young topic and hence under-developed in theory, an approach of 'theory elaboration' has been undertaken. An exploratory approach based on qualitative case study methodology has been used. This addresses the different internal and external influences on managerial decision making on the issues. Internal factors are described as the culture and mindset, external factors are stakeholder influences. A comparison of firms against macro-level sustainability criteria is then taken.
Findings are:

1: companies that are privately owned appear less cost-sensitive than publicly listed companies and are able to act on the basis of values-based rather than clearly defined, metric-based arguments. This is important when a values-based approach is able to better deal with uncertainty or ambiguity in the business case for sustainability. 

2: Taking a cross-sector analysis of firms has meant being able to model the economic constraints that certain firms and sectors exist in. Regulation is a major driver for change that once introduced can eliminate uncertainty around the business case. Pressure from investors or consumers is a further form of external influence.

3: A further finding from this is that where firms are consumer-facing, the economic argument can be driven by consumer values more strongly than in business-to-business firms. As a result, many high profile firms obtain a competitive advantage by satisfying consumers values.

4: However, when studying the relative impacts of organisations on particular environmental challenges, high profile pro-sustainability companies may have a very low substantive impact, and vice versa, low profile ones may have a very high impact. 

A divide can thus be seen between substantive sustainability actions and symbolic sustainability actions and a model is developed to show the alignment between economic outcomes and sustainable &amp;amp; responsible business outcomes. 

Where aligned, there is an economic benefit in sustainability practices. The scale of this progress on a macro-scale can then also be considered. However, if there is no alignment, then for privately owned companies it is easier to decide to invest in developing these areas. Or, these are areas where regulators may step in (as in the principle of market failure), or investors or others may push for innovation to address the misalignment. 

This is then the basis for a model of sustainable supply chain decision making. A firm's supply chain context and economic context, and influence on managerial decision making, are described. A normative element based on macro-scale sustainability goals (using the 'planetary boundaries' framework, and the UN Rio+20 social indicators), provide an example of what firm-level sustainability policy should or could address. Thirdly, a prescriptive element shows the gap between the firm's context and the macro-scale goals in order to determine the firm's significance and hence recommendations. This establishes whether a firm is making a meaningful contribution to sustainability, or only a relatively meaningless one. Furthermore, by mapping the impacts made by certain sectors and their supply chain links, it is possible to see which companies do play a substantive role both negative but also, more importantly, positive.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has involved working with senior management in a range of companies and there has been enthusiasm from these to receive the findings on completion. A workshop of findings was proposed, however scheduling constraints by the participants and the wide geographic range means that a practitioner-facing summary on final completion of the research will be the preferred route. Some participants are keen for follow up meetings, and these may lead to future research partnerships. In addition, discussions have been help with consultancy practices (including Accenture, McKinsey, Carbonsmart, Futerra) who are also interested in the findings.
In terms of policy-maker impact, there are a number of potential routes via BIS, DEFRA and DECC, as well as the Welsh Assemble Government. However, this route is being considered in more detail for a post-doctorate funding award recently submitted, involving staff from Cardiff Law School and Politics Department via the ESRC BRASS Centre network (Business Relationships, Accountability, Sustainability and Society).
For academic impact, a new area of interaction between supply chain management, decision sciences, ethics, sustainability and strategic management has been established. Findings have been presented at various conferences and symposia and professional and personal relationships have been established across these respective communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5A3FE8DA-3692-4475-B1F2-CCE7869C9D20</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5452b2c8692e65.84443174</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Creative Economy,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://business.cardiff.ac.uk/people/staff/anthony-alexander</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Qualitative data set from organisations implementing sustainable supply chain management policies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4E2F911A-5E24-4A4E-935C-13B821AD1CB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of data to other researchers in the field via ESRC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7f90af373b4.19667967</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sustainable Supply Chain Management data set</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>03DC303E-382B-4EE9-9234-5AE541FED4E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Decision theory in sustainable supply chain management: a literature review</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Supply Chain Management: An International Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/02234af7b2d10401a100bdb7f0ad2c8c"><gtr:id>02234af7b2d10401a100bdb7f0ad2c8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alexander A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5452ad56dff806.13733877</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2CC1ED12-29CB-46DE-9FE0-0E843D380E6D</gtr:id><gtr:title>A decision theory perspective on complexity in performance measurement and management</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Operations &amp;
