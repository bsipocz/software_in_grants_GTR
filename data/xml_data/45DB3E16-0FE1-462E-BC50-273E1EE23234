Existing research concerning such 'sovereign defaults' is typically based on quantitative data, however, which assumes short-term causes and consequences based on rational calculations of states' economic interests. Curiously, scholars and policymakers have not adopted qualitative methods to analyse such events in detail or context. As such, the longer-term and wider-ranging causes and consequences of sovereign default remain neglected, which distorts academic analysis and misleads governments seeking to avoid unpaid debts. My project adopts historical and case study methods to answer two questions. First, what are the longer-term and wider-ranging causes and consequences of sovereign default? Second, to what extent is it possible to generalize the non-economic causes of unpaid debts across history?

The research project consequently divides into two parts. First, I will produce a book that presents the first historical analysis of one sovereign default--namely, the UK's failure to repay $4.2bn of war loans from America after 1933--to provide the most nuanced account of any unpaid debt to date. Drawing on six decades of archival material in both countries, and building on an earlier pilot-study, I will analyse the period from the end of World War I to the UK's return to the New York bond market in 1978. I will pay particular attention to political, diplomatic and social variables, in an effort to show that a focus on short-term economic measurements provides an incomplete and sometimes misleading account of default. I will document the default for both states by focusing on institutional changes concerning national finances, variations in key areas of transatlantic relations, and shifting national attitudes towards debt.

Second, I will build on my archival research to produce an article in a leading journal that establishes and tests two novel and generalizable explanations for sovereign default by major economic powers. The consensus view within the International Relations and Economics literatures, which focus on rational calculations of a state's economic interests, is incomplete because default can serve other objectives. Defaults sometimes reflect domestic-political interests or shifts in national identities. Using secondary sources and published data to examine decision-making at the time, I will test my claims by examining case studies across the twentieth century where major economic powers failed to pay their debts. These case studies will also test my assumption that states tend to downplay the longer and wider consequences of default.

It is an opportune time to conduct such research for two reasons. First, it is highly relevant to contemporary debates about debt. My work will inform the cost-benefit calculations of policymakers, whether they are considering lending, borrowing or defaulting. I plan to share key archival data in online and searchable data repositories to ensure that financial analysts have easy access to raw data to inform their own work. Second, the project coincides with the centenary of the end of WW1, thereby benefiting from growing interest in the consequences of the Great War and war debts more broadly. Building on this rising interest, I will encourage policymakers, scholars, and the public to rethink the orthodoxies of sovereign default. 

My research project will connect scholars in the humanities and social sciences, establishing me as a leader in the interdisciplinary study of sovereign default. I will then seek to reset the international research agenda by guiding research towards a wider range of variables and multiple methodologies. An AHRC fellowship would develop my leadership skills by allowing me to organise international events, gain project management experience, and expand my professional network. The fellowship would thus amplify the project's impact and support my career development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fresh insights concerning the causes and consequences of sovereign default will be of substantial interest for policymakers, financial analysts, and the public (for further details, see PtI). My work will benefit these groups by informing economic policymaking, providing new ways to think about unpaid debts, and offering an accessible historical account of sovereign default.

I present an impression of the scope of the project's impact below, but the research and networking activities that form part of the project should result in additional impact, which I will explore as they arise. As my research initially focuses on the UK, I will concentrate my efforts on British policymakers before targeting other countries. The University of Nottingham has supported these efforts by choosing me as its representative for a Whitehall-based placement scheme in 2016.

Practitioners and policy makers
By revealing that the causes and consequences of sovereign default extend far beyond short-term changes in rational economic interests, and sharing key evidence in searchable online repositories, my research will feed directly into the cost-benefit calculations that policymakers use to decide whether or when they should ever default. In addition, my work will offer novel insights into how lenders can recognise borrowers that might fail to repay their debts. Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) and the History and Policy Unit have already expressed interest in my preliminary research in this area. Indeed, there is a growing appetite for historically informed research (see CfS). I will also attempt to build closer relations with the Bank of England, the Debt Management Office and the U.S. Treasury, all of whom manage sovereign debts. I will enhance impact through an end-of-project workshop (run in conjunction with the History and Policy Unit) and a daylong suite of training seminars based in Nottingham targeted at a practitioner audience interested in qualitative research. Both will serve as a forum to communicate the research findings to practitioners, publicise my online repositories, and encourage ongoing knowledge transfer. 

Financial analysts, think tanks and non-academic researchers
Research that moves beyond narrow, short-term assessments of the causes and consequences of sovereign default will appeal to analysts in the financial sector seeking to protect their investments and to research groups interested in improving economic policymaking, such as Chatham House or the Peterson Institute for International Economics. My findings should encourage new ways of thinking about achieving such objectives. These could range from generating interest in mixed-methodological approaches when researching the subject to encouraging closer engagement with historians and social scientists. Having worked in the financial sector and with research groups in the past (see CV), I intend to draw on my existing networks to help disseminate my findings (see PtI).

The public
Sovereign default is a fascinating, controversial, and emotive topic. Countries' unpaid debts have dominated headlines for centuries, especially in recent decades following major financial crises. The subject interests and angers the public around the world, but most people know little about the causes or consequences of such events beyond the vast sums involved. Moreover, in the UK and US, the risk of default appears for many as a problem for other, typically less-developed countries; few people are aware that both states have defaulted on their own debts in the twentieth century. I will use traditional and social media, alongside public talks and academic articles, to provide the UK and US public with a better understanding of their own histories of sovereign debt and the wider consequences of default. This project also coincides with the centenary of the end of WW1, thereby contributing to growing media and public interest concerning the costs and consequences of the Great War.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171828</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006582/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E889DE6C-93D7-4BC9-92AA-7A4698F7D850</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat Political Economy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
