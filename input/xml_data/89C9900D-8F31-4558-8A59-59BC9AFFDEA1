Cities need to be sustainable, to be resilient and to thrive no matter how the future unfolds. This means we need to be smart about how we plan and operate our cities and decisions need to be made using the best available data - a strong evidence base where multiple and varied datasets can be integrated to answer shared challenges in our cities. 

Understanding and valuing our natural environment is important for city development. For example, the subterranean environment is utilised for space, water, minerals, heat, waste and water disposal, transport and communication networks. The natural environment may therefore be considered as a service-provider for our built environment E.g. the natural environment provides a 'platform' for development, 'provision' of resources, 'regulation' of human activity e.g. pollution and 'supports' habitat. By assessing the environmental and socio-economic services provided by the natural environment it is possible to develop city-wide tools that integrate the environment with land use and city services such that space in our urban areas is used most effectively for environmental, economic and social well-being.
&amp;gt; Objective: to develop multi-dimensional city-wide tools that integrate the environment with land use and city services.

In future our cities need to cope with increased pressures such as changes in population, land use and climate. Higher 'loading' on our urban areas can lead to significant environmental constraints such as increased flood risk and resource insecurity. For our cities to be more resilient we need to evaluate these environmental constraints against future scenarios and predictions.
&amp;gt; Objective: to integrate multiple datasets to assess environmental constraints for city resilience under future scenarios.

To meet these objectives I will address the following:
1. What environmental data can be applied to urban challenges?
I will meet with city partners to identify their drivers, challenges and needs and I will present this information to data providers to align environmental datasets with the urban challenges. I will collate and classify relevant research and datasets to increase awareness and accessibility.
2. How is environmental data presented, what are the high-impact exemplars, what new technologies are emerging?
I will work with data experts to review existing data formats, platforms, presentation and tools. I will evaluate best practice, emerging technologies and feedback from end-users to produce impact case studies.
3. Existing environmental datasets are used more widely for urban challenges.
I will promote existing environmental datasets and capability to stakeholders through interactive workshops, smart-media and networks.
4. New datasets and tools are developed for urban challenges and to inform city processes.
Using the knowledge exchange I will develop a series of datasets and tools, framed around city environmental needs (platform, provision, regulation, support); Data will be integrated with the Cities-lab and the value of environmental data for city services will be presented more explicitly.

This programme of work will enhance NERC's reputation by delivering knowledge to end users in the urban environment, which combines robust science data with sound scientific advice. The impact of the fellowship also extends to the FutureCities groups, city stakeholders and academic partners where access to environmental data improves, science research is aligned to urban challenges, new tools and technologies are validated in city-labs and multiple environmental datasets are integrated with other city metrics lead to the development of coupled city models and optimised planning tools.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>London 2036 - Created by the Future Cities Catapult in Partnership with NERC and CASA, UCL.
What would your ideal city be like, and how would you create it? London 2036 puts the public in control of London, painting pictures of many possible futures for the city through data modelling techniques.
The gamified data model asks quick-fire questions around civic problems, policies and personal preferences. It then predicts how these choices would impact the social, environmental and economical state of the city in 2036. You can compare your London 2036 vision to the city we live in today, and explore the model of the future London predicted by the aggregated choices of exhibition visitors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5C76E16-AD78-4E1E-98B2-3D2E5615E3E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact from this piece is at an ealry stage as the exhibition is still on and the full impact hasn't bee collected at this stage.

It is recognised that existing data, in particular environment and utility datasets, are not fully utilised to inform planning decisions at a local and strategic level. Failure to consider the full suite of data for cities weakens the evidence base on which planning decisions are made and leads to inefficiencies and a late stage awareness of potential issues. This situation is most pronounced for underground development in cities.
There is currently no formal policy for integrating urban underground space and above ground city services within the planning framework and no one organisation with a mandate to take ownership of this issue. However there are a number of projects and initiatives underway which are beginning to address elements of the issue, such as city data management tools, infrastructure mapping, integrated city modelling, building information modelling systems and collation of good practice demonstrators. To capitalise on these initiatives and bring the subsurface into strategic city planning the workshop, hosted by the Future Cities Catapult at their Urban Innovation Centre drew together science expertise and city innovators that work across the boundary between surface and subsurface spatial planning and use, and city modelling. The aim was to demonstrate capability and share learning, identify commercial opportunities to address the challenges, and consider how we can advance this topic at a strategic level within UK cities.
Outcomes and Impact:
i) City mapping platform: The use case developed in the workshop on a 3D approach to city mapping standards and models is being taken forward by the Future Cities Catapult, NERC (BGS) and the Ordnance Survey (OS). A project outline has been prepared and funding routes for a prototype are being pursued. Partners:Future Cities Catapult; NERC(BGS); Ordnance Survey
ii) Brownfield cost calculator tool: A follow up meeting with Manchester local authority and the Homes and Communities Agency highlighted the potential for a brownfield cost calculator tool. The tool would bring together various environmental datasets, planning information and economic information to highlight where redevelopment of brownfield land is most cost-effective. A proposal to prototype the tool for Manchester has been submitted. A linked KE fellowship proposal on Brownfield development is being developed. Partners: Future Cities Catapult; NERC; BGS; Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA); Homes and Communities Agency.
iii) Glasgow spatial planning: Glasgow City Council are introducing supplementary planning for the subsurface in conjunction with BGS through a NERC KE fellowship. Following the workshop the OS are working with them to help create a demonstration of an integrated above-below ground city BIM system. Partners: Glasgow City Council; Ordnance Survey; NERC (BGS).
iv) Data exchange and BIM demonstrator: Through the BGS national capability programme and a linked NERC secondment with the Environment Agency new protocols for data exchange have been agreed and a cross-organisation demonstration of the use of BIM is underway. Partners: NERC (BGS); Environment Agency
v) Urban Underground Space: A new committee has been formed called Think Deep UK which aims to reform the management of urban underground space through better planning and policy. Outcomes from the workshop are informing the aims of the group and planned activities.

Cities face a myriad of potential future shocks and stresses. To meet these challenges they must work to identify risks and mitigate against them with location as a key component. The conference asked the following of participants: How should we best monitor, measure and manage our cities? The growth of the Internet of Things: will it improve the way we all navigate our cities? How do we successfully translate urban data to measure our key cities' economies? How do we capture citizens' wishes to shape the urban environments of the future?

Insights gained from the fellowship on the role of environment for economic cities that are also resilient and sustainable are captured in two invited Thought Pieces for the GO Science Foresight Future of Cities programme. 
i) Future of Cities: development underground https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-cities-development-underground.
ii) Future Visions for water and cities written collectively by the UK Water Partnership Water and Cities task force, into which I provide advise on urban groundwater issues. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-cities-water-and-cities.

(2015) Big Bang Data Exhibition, Somerset House:
The Future Cities Catapult created a gaming model - London 2036 - for the Big Bang Data exhibition at Somerset House which was done in partnership with my NERC fellowship and CASA, UCL. The gamified data model asks the general public questions around environmental, mobility and housing problems, policies and personal preferences. It then predicts how these choices would impact the social, environmental and economical state of the city in 2036 to invite people to think about the social, environmental and economic factors that together determine the future landscape of the city. NERC data (Future Flows) and expertise were used to develop the water and energy sections of the model and to inform the climate and environment related outcomes. The game has been play by over 12,000 members of the public. 

(2016) Follow-on commercial funding and practitioner buy-in: An expert workshop on integrated city mapping and modelling approaches has resulted in:
- a collaborative co-funded innovation project between the Future Cities Catapult, Ordnance Survey and the British Geological Survey (Project Iceberg) to evaluate the technological capability, market drivers and societal and business benefits of an integrated data system that enables the complementary use of above-below ground data to support e.g. utility sector, brownfield development, street works.
- support for the inception if Think Deep UK a newly formed group of built environment experts committed to creating resilient, sustainable and liveable cities through smart use of underground space. The launch was attended by &amp;gt;100 professionals across geotechnical, urban planning, law, architecture, environmental, utility sectors. www.tduk.org https://vimeo.com/206363371

(2017) Decision-support tool for brownfield redevelopment:
- A prototype Brownfield Cost Calculator tool has been developed for Greater Manchester in partnership with the Environment Agency, Greater Manchester Authority, New Economy and the Future Cities Catapult. The tool uses environmental data held by NERC and the EA in combination with methodologies developed by the Homes and Communities Agency to estimate brownfield remediation costs. The tool help local authorities to identify land for their brownfield register which is more favourable for development and allows small-medium developers to identify economically viable land. Funding is being sought to take the tool to prototype to full-implementation phase.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>715E0B0F-4F63-4795-8166-C6F252ED3668</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56daf9672b55d1.07595721</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF568120-AFC7-463C-969A-CB3D4FFF2873</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accounting for groundwater in future city visions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f5db27ffb341b32ee78d0dc83c593a30"><gtr:id>f5db27ffb341b32ee78d0dc83c593a30</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bricker, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c03dd2e3da16.59909281</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>64E665C7-681E-4253-8A46-995B452AFD93</gtr:id><gtr:title>City Spatial Planning and Modelling: Hidden Depths, Workshop Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebacbf20ee646b5dc615ec3cb5431ce8"><gtr:id>ebacbf20ee646b5dc615ec3cb5431ce8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bricker, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56db0003234563.90857346</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B207D846-7A39-4C62-B5CF-8E737CB9F8C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>To dig or not to dig?
