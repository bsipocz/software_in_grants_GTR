The use of light to communicate and process information is widely recognised as the technology that will drive innovations in the 21st century across a wide range of areas, from information technology, energy and sensing, to healthcare. So far, control of light flow has been achieved by carefully and periodically structured materials, which can bend light, slow it down and stop if for a short time, to allow for the processing steps to take place. 
Due to advances in theoretical, computational and nano-fabrication capabilities we are no longer restricted to well-defined periodic structures. Instead we can construct complex systems made of apparently random patterns, which when suitably designed, can lead to performances superior to those offered by conventional photonic systems. 
The proposed project will focus on the development of hyperuniform disordered nanophotonic materials, a novel class of photonic structures in which structural correlations and disorder are accurately controlled. Discovered in 2009, these new materials have already attracted considerable attention as they combine the robust properties of periodic systems with the flexibility of disordered ones. We will explore the properties of hyperuniform media with the goal to control light flow, to enhance light emission, and to construct novel type of lasers and optical circuits.
The research proposed will enhance UK's capabilities in disordered photonic materials, laser technology and integrated photonics circuitry, will have direct impact on more efficient and cost effective photovoltaic power generation and efficient lightning; the advanced optical capabilities to be enabled by our research will support the constant exponential growth of the &amp;quot;internet of things&amp;quot;.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of advanced photonic materials and novel characterisation, design, simulation methods to characterise them are critical for enabling the next generation of future technologies for information processing and communication, advancing the infrastructure for the &amp;quot;internet of things&amp;quot;, energy harvesting and energy conversion systems, healthcare and biophotonics, and quantum information processing on nanophotonics platforms. For many of these applications photon management on versatile photonic-circuit platforms, integration of light sources with on-demand spatial and spectral characteristics, and addressing the effects of structural imperfections are major challenges that need to be urgently addressed. 
We strongly believe that the research we propose will produce fundamental and technological advances in the field of nanophotonics, from novel disordered photonic materials to laser technology and integrated photonics circuitry, which will be of benefit to industry and researchers alike. These advances will contribute to setting the international agenda in the field of disordered photonic materials. Immediate commercial benefit will be in the fields of network components and optical equipment where our patent applications and industrial collaborations can be directly exploited. On longer term, developers, manufacturers and integrators of optical interconnection systems will benefit from denser, faster and more energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits enabled by our research. Furthermore, the development of flexible strategies for efficient light trapping and light coupling in thin hyperuniform disordered films to be pursued in this project is expected to have an important impact on new technologies related to thin-film photovoltaic cells.
The field of disordered photonics has grown tremendously in the last years and the advances in this field are currently being exploited to challenge existing technological roadblocks and deliver photonic devices with performance far superior to current technologies. The research proposed is an integral part of a global effort to pursue new disruptive innovations such that photonic technologies (a $375 billion market in 2013) can reach their full potential. The United Nations has proclaimed 2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies (http://www.light2015.org), recognising the importance of raising global awareness about how light-based technologies promote sustainable development and provide solutions to global challenges in energy, education, agriculture and health. The broad impact of our research on hyperuniform disordered structures will also be of benefit outside of academia and industry, to governmental and independent policy makers, funders of academic and industrial research, to the educational sector, and ultimately to the wider public and the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356873</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Together with Dr. Marian Florescu, Surrey University, we have made a short video about nano photonics and hyperuniform photonics materials, which is almost complete</gtr:description><gtr:id>65729DE4-4A81-4CF5-9C0E-F2A935D52BAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not complete yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b941d8ed2a75.71769199</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Film on Nanophotonics and hyperuniform photonics materials</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press Release from Phys.org</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5CB284F8-92D4-49F9-B3B4-918DDAC2C12B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our publication &amp;quot;Local self-uniformity in photonic networks&amp;quot; has attracted great interest from both the scientific community and the industry community.

A major finding of the research funded on this grant has been the discovery of local-self uniformity a amendment concept inspired by hyperuniformity. We have found a direct relationship between the uniformity of the internal structure (at wavelength scales) and its ability to block certain wavelengths in natural materials. We have also developed a new mathematical metric to measure which photonic structures best control the propagation of light enabling the design of new materials with different functionalities dependant on need. We have also fabricated and characterised the first-ever alumina amorphous gyroid structures and demonstrated the presence of large photonic band gaps. Our finding have been recognised as an important advance not only by the scientific community (see our recent Nature Communication publication), but also by a variety of news outlets and the 3D printing industry (see press coverage from Phys.org, Optics.org, Science Daily, 3DPrint.com, 3D Printing Industry).

2. We have discovered a new class of hyperuniform disordered materials that can block the propagation of acoustic and/or elastic waves through the presence of a phononic band gap. We have also introduced the first designs of elastic cavities and waveguides that are able to precisely confine and control the flow of elastic waves.Our discovery has important applications towards the realisation of integrated phononic circuits.

3. We have introduced the first hyperuniform metasurfaces that allow the control of light scattering and fluorescence forcing a ring-like emission.

4. Employing methods developed for photonic systems, we have been able to explore band structure unfolding in dilute bismide alloys. Our work provide a solid fundamental basis for the development of transferable computational methods, and the exploration of disordered metrics spanning a variety of physical systems, from photonics to electronics and phononics.

Hyperuniform phononic materials can provide a flexible platform for integrated phononic circuitry. 

Metasurfaces are very important to control the light propagation and emission, especially for next generation integrated and ultra-thin optical elements.

Dilute bismide alloys are promising a strong alternative for the realisation of highly-efficient telecom lasers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5ACBD49B-BEF4-4C88-A2AF-A245494FEA27</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c27345280996.17102031</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14439</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>During our research in hyperuniform and local self-uniform disordered structures, we have collaborated with Fraunhofer institute to design and fabricated the first-ever 3D printed alumina amorphous gyroid structures.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3331B27-A873-4824-B62C-188F32CC788D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The new method developed has been highlighted by various 3D printing new agency as an important development in the field.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0199c96df61.52394800</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>3D printing of alumina structures for micro-structured photonic materials</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/3d-printed-ceramic-butterfly-wings-add-color-photonic-research-106538/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A524DB3-A658-459F-88D5-BF6BB3B1077B</gtr:id><gtr:title>High-Q photonic crystal cavities in all-semiconductor photonic crystal heterostructures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/be26d15c0ae0c4b5b1c30fcd8d67ce76"><gtr:id>be26d15c0ae0c4b5b1c30fcd8d67ce76</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bushell Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe31d5040d4.13327593</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5E5BC96C-4CD8-4AA8-8882-1F9B86F429FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Freeform Phononic Waveguides</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Crystals</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68dbb972089139695f8e6ed86ef8498d"><gtr:id>68dbb972089139695f8e6ed86ef8498d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gkantzounis G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995ad73daed8.10107320</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9802C9C-3EDF-4734-B7B3-DB8F3C580520</gtr:id><gtr:title>Energy-Momentum Cathodoluminescence Spectroscopy of Dielectric Nanostructures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS Photonics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5bae319bcc7874b984cac9629cb58ed3"><gtr:id>5bae319bcc7874b984cac9629cb58ed3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mignuzzi S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a8b3f4d38c6d3.30722407</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE45A7C0-9561-410A-89B0-0148B714FB73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unfolding the band structure of GaAsBi.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
