Following 30 years of neglect, this Grade II* listed country house of Tudor origins became a dilapidated shell, although it is now the focus of major restoration efforts under the direction of the Poltimore House Trust (PHT), with funding from English Heritage.\n\nThe building's iconic local status and the PHT's ongoing restoration and research efforts, combined with the PI and CI's expertise, offer a unique opportunity widen access to archaeological and historical understandings of Poltimore House as the centrepiece of a 'polite landscape', a grand residence set in parkland and gardens, that in the 20th century was re-used as a school and then a hospital. The commencement of Poltimore House's restoration in 2009 presents an ideal moment for the project to capitalise on the building's high public profile and add value to the on-going building conservation programme. The project will illuminate the rich history of Poltimore's once closed and 'elite' landscape and open it up as a community heritage resource. The principal focus of interest will be the Poltimore landscape between the 16th and 20th centuries, although the estate shows evidence of human activity ranging from prehistoric settlements to a Cold War Headquarters of the Royal Observer Corps. Through an interactive web-site allowing users to engage with the research processes involved in understanding this landscape, allied to outreach events and innovative ways of presenting the house and its grounds, the project will promote public engagement with this resource and lay the foundations for its future educational use.\n\nA crucial aspect of the project is that the processes of garden and landscape research (rather than purely its results) will be opened up to wider audiences. Through the website and outreach programme, members of the public and schoolchildren will be able to explore 'above-ground' archaeology such as earthworks and hedgerows, and interact with historical research processes including using maps and estate records. While the Trust is only currently able to open the house for occasional open days, the project will make the experience of exploring and understanding the site's grounds freely available through a virtual environment, including, for instance, images and panoramic video footage of the house and its grounds, input from schoolchildren and visitors on their experiences of the site, and expert commentary on the estate. Crucially, this will transform the PHT's capacity to present and utilise the Poltimore estate as a cultural and historical resource.\n\nAcademic researchers within universities have too often worked in isolation from heritage organisations and charitable trusts; this project will enhance working relationships between the two sectors through knowledge exchange. It is led by a partnership between a non-academic body (PHT), an organisation responsible for the management of the house and fully committed to community and educational outreach, and an interdisciplinary team of University researchers led by an archaeologist (Dr Oliver Creighton, specialist in medieval and Tudor elite landscapes) and an historian (Dr Henry French, whose expertise is in early modern rural society). The project has potential to make a significant difference outside academia by making widely available knowledge of the research processes involved in interpreting local historic landscapes; by promoting community pride in the landscape; and by providing an historic landscape case study of wider generic public interest. In economic and cultural terms, the project will also add new value to the Poltimore House Trust's re-launch of the house as a key regional focus for creativity and the arts, creating new opportunities for promoting the groundsand gardens as sustainable educational assets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's outcomes are designed to transform the experiences and attitudes of groups within the community as well as across the heritage and local government sectors. The beneficiaries of the project fall into five main categories (in addition to the academic beneficiaries detailed in the preceding section).\n\n1. Members of the community, living in the immediate locality of Poltimore, the city of Exeter and the surrounding region, will benefit from increased accessibility to knowledge about the site and heightened awareness of its importance as an historical asset. This will foster engagement with the PHT's ongoing educational and charitable objectives.\n\n2. Schoolchildren will benefit from increased access to the educational resource of an historic landscape on their doorstep. Through the project's strong links to local schools (including Broadclyst Community Primary School and Uffculme Secondary School), schoolchildren will be able to engage with the histories of the Poltimore estate, for instance through on-site workshops and school visits, as part of the National Curriculum. These activities will feed into advanced projects at A-Level and ICT History activities linked to the heritage of Poltimore.\n\n3. Further beneficiaries would be members of the local societies and volunteer groups with which the project will liaise (including Devon Archaeological Society, the Exeter and Devon Institution and Friends of Poltimore House). Open days and outreach/training activities will disseminate research and professional skills (including giving guided tours and teaching skills of interpretation in the field) that will develop the capacity of these groups to study and engage with other historic landscapes in the region. \n\n4. More generally, this research will provide a resource and case-study to the wider constituency of members of the general public within the UK who are passionately interested in the historic landscape. The freely available nature of the research outputs and the highly interactive nature of the website ensures that the project can inspire similar community-led research elsewhere through a local (but universally applicable) case study.\n\n5. The project will have direct relevance to policy makers, planners and decision-makers, particularly in the local government sector (Exeter City Council and East Devon District Council). For instance, increased knowledge of the archaeological character of Poltimore's surroundings and heightened awareness of the historic landscape's importance will be relevant to decisions made in the planning process, and the project will inform PHT's future management and development of the landscape around the house.\n\nThe project's evaluation mechanisms will ensure delivery of these benefits to the stakeholders while the publicity generated by the project will ensure maximum impact for the PHT's longer-term development objectives (coinciding with PHT's 10th anniversary, and the commencement of the house's restoration). The project's outcomes will have immediate short-term benefits over the two-year lifetime of the Fellowship, but it will also lay the foundations for a sustainable future for the Poltimore estate as a community heritage resource. The project will provide vital resources and expertise, transforming the PHT's ability to run Poltimore House's grounds and estate as an educational facility, through greatly increased expertise in educational outreach.\n\nThe project's management structure is designed to ensure that these groups and stakeholders benefit from, and can shape, the outcomes, and representatives from the key local government and educational sectors are accordingly represented on it. In addition, the project is embedded within the University of Exeter's School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HUSS), which has extensive experience of KT partnerships.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159566</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poltimore Landscapes webpage</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65FB799B-2800-42EC-8088-363B670B7155</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dedicated project webpage providing information on the project, advertising its activities, and developing opportunities for partners inclusing schools and volunteers to interact.

Characterised by the co-creation of knowledge with a wide variety of stakeholders (including local schoolchildren, volunteers, members of the local public and University students), the project succeeded in heightening awareness of the multi-layered heritage of this special place through a programme of outreach activities.

The project met all objectives identified in the grant proposal and is enabling the Poltimore House Trust to develop future community heritage initiatives beyond the lifetime of the two-year Fellowship, while also contributing to the Trust's wider redevelopment plans and adding value to their on-going restoration of the house. 

Key areas of impact are:

? Creating a portfolio of resources and generating a network of contacts that have transformed the capacity of the Trust to carry out educational work. During the course of the project 721 school pupils from 7 partner schools have participated in 18 training and outreach events mapped to the National Curriculum (including on-site training workshops on masonry recording, archaeological survey, landscape analysis and visits to schools).

? Carrying out a comprehensive programme of archaeological fieldwork in the environs of the house, including geophysical and topographical survey, tree survey, test-pitting and field walking, supported by volunteer-led archival analysis. The Trust has been supplied with a detailed history of the park and gardens surrounding the house that will inform future management. All activities were carried out with volunteers, providing training opportunities, and have enabled new understandings of the estate's development. Key academic findings will be published in a journal article ('Peopling Polite Landscapes: Community and Heritage at Poltimore, Devon', by Oliver Creighton, Penny Cunningham and Henry French, in Landscape History 34.2, 2013). These activities have also created graphical materials such as reconstructions and phased plans that can be included in future publications by the Trust.

? Generating greater public interest in the neglected historic landscape at Poltimore and making the techniques of landscape research more widely accessible to the general public. During the course of the project 2,127 members of the public participated in 86 training and outreach events (including flagship launch events and an end of project symposium), while a partnership with the social enterprise Forward25 (www.forward25.com/) provided placements and workplace experience for local unemployed people. This volunteer network is continuing historical and archaeological landscape research in the area beyond the lifetime of the AHRC-funded project, enabling the public to transfer that understanding to other landscapes.

? Ensuring that the project findings and the heritage of the estate are accessible to wider public audiences through the internet. The project website (elac.ex.ac.uk/poltimore-landscapes/), constructed with community engagement, encourages visitors to experience and explore the Poltimore historic landscape and its development from prehistory to the present, and presents a platform for the continuation of similar work in the future.

? Opening up access to knowledge about Poltimore, its gardens and estates for on-site visitors through new interpretative materials, including the of accessible display boards incorporating the work of children and volunteers, and the production of freely available leaflets providing key information and maps.

? A major legacy is the establishment of a volunteer- and community-led group (the Poltimore Estate History and Archaeology Group), formed in late 2012 and meeting regularly, that will continue educational, research and outreach activities initiated by the Knowledge Transfer Fellowship.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D9FCC1F1-FE94-4E0E-8AB7-3552ABC513C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546a314929ee51.19502964</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings and achievements of the project are:
The Knowledge Transfer Fellowship succeeded in transforming the capacity of the Poltimore House Trust to run outreach activities and carry out educational work beyond the lifetime of the funded two-year project. Through establishing The Poltimore Estate History and Archaeology Group (PEHAG) the project has established foundations to carry out further research and interpret the multiple histories of Poltimore House and its environs. This, combined with outreach and training activities, has enabled the public to transfer that understanding to other historic landscapes and engage in similar work in the future.

Through establishing a dedicated interactive website (http://elac.ex.ac.uk/poltimore-landscapes/) the project has succeeded in making widely accessible knowledge and understanding of the research techniques involved in exploring the Poltimore landscape. This, combined with the installation of six display boards and the production of two leaflets guiding visitors around the landscape and the training of on-site guides, has opened up access to knowledge about Poltimore, its gardens and estates, projecting this rich source of social and landscape history to new audiences in the region and beyond.

Via a programme of training and outreach events (including flagship launch events, on-site training workshops and school visits), the project developed a case study of how to make public involvement central to the processes of understanding historic landscapes.

The publication of an open access article on the project's findings in a peer-reviewed academic journal (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01433768.2013.855398#.VGo1Ymdb3fM) has succeeded in disseminating key research results and highlighted best practice in conducting community heritage research to a wide academic audience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The grant outcomes have several potential uses in non-academic contexts:



Education: production of free and accessible educational materials, including biographies for Key Stage 2 History; enhancement of Poltimore House as an educational resource through installation of display boards and provision of guided on-site activities.



Tourism/recreation: transformation of the way Poltimore House is presented to the general public through the installation of five display boards around the gardens and grounds and the production of a user-friendly guide/leaflet; heightened profile for the site which can attract greater numbers of visitors and tourists to the site and locality for open days.



Environment/landuse: enhanced understanding of the local environment and, especially its time-depth and distinctiveness, for local communities; increased knowledge of the landscape's history and archaeology, which can feed into the planning process.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E3AA3554-D9FB-4641-8EC6-E696E3B4ACC8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4480916135.460992775b84fe</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://elac.ex.ac.uk/poltimore-landscapes/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EFA110C3-C92A-418F-8E66-00FFE3E5F709</gtr:id><gtr:title>Peopling polite landscapes: community and heritage at Poltimore, Devon</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Landscape History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e652df8fc759d9ef8769c18e3629561c"><gtr:id>e652df8fc759d9ef8769c18e3629561c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Creighton O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03b03be7549dc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1AF3B799-813B-4077-9CAA-785B8543F4B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Food, Farming and Fishing in Devon During the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8d2ec0363b0be5c4f2020e908f12edad"><gtr:id>8d2ec0363b0be5c4f2020e908f12edad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>French, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a5de5234a156.54329226</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H03806X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
