Ensuring effective health management has become the single most important challenge for sustainable intensification of the smallholder sector just as restrictions on antibiotic use are being imposed. Farmers are increasingly dependent on a proliferating range of prophylactic products (including pre and probiotics), often of uncertain provenance &amp;amp; efficacy. Furthermore, the emergent markets for these products lack appropriate regulatory frameworks and the economic burden of unjustified claims is likely to fall most heavily on small-holders. An independent cost-benefit assessment of the efficacy, costs and benefits of such products is urgently required. Working across a range of major commodity farmed species and system types, the project will also assess the potential for novel low-cost alternatives to contribute to improved animal health and profitability of intensified smallholder operations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Probiotics alter the intestinal microbiome, or the microbiological composition of pond water and sediments. Modifications in the composition of the microbiome, alter the immune response and change a host's ability to resist infection. The microbiome educates the immune system; inducing tolerance to luminal contents and by stimulating and enhancing local and systemic immune responses for the detection of incoming pathogens. In addition, the microbiome promotes gut physiological functions such as maintenance of mucosal barrier integrity, competitive exclusion of gut pathogens, organisation of gut lymphoid tissue, modulation of epithelial cell differentiation, absorption of nutrients and induction of Ig+ cells, granulocytes and T cells. A balanced microbiota is essential for health and growth in farmed species; perturbation of non-pathogenic microbes in the existing microbiome alters production. Probiotics have been found to increase lymphoid tissue of fish interacting with the microbiome in a complex response involving the production and regulation of cytokines and effector and regulatory T cells. For example, different probiotics have been found to have beneficial effects in Tilapia with increased serum complement activity, enhanced phagocytosis and bacterial killing associated with an increase in peripheral inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNFa [. Several other studies report probiotic Bacillus sp. to increase shrimp survival and notably in a mix with Vibrio sp to be protective against V.harveyi and the white spot virus (WSSV). Vaccines exploit the adaptive component of the immune system but many do not provide full protection. Vaccines are also inappropriate for shellfish, which rely on innate mechanisms. Scope therefore exists to target the innate component for both finfish and shellfish, non-specifically, to infection by acting as a 'surveillance and rapid response' mechanism. Unlike the adaptive system it functions through all life stages.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims (i) to improve profitability of intensifying smallholder farmers directly: through improved prophylactic health management capacity and indirectly through development of standardized assessment procedures and improved regulation of commercial PHPs (ii) to develop internal capacity to support future research on PHP efficacy, regulation and economic benefit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1473592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>4 MSc students and junior staff of the recently established Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU) funded to work on the project through a separate British Council 'Inspire' Grant (lead by the University of Stirling).

PHP value-chains supplying shrimp farmers are being characterized in the main production areas of Khulna and Andhra Pradesh Provinces in India and Bangladesh. Other focal species; pangasius catfish, carps and tilapia are the focus of study in Mymensingh District, Bangladesh and West Bengal Province in India. 
A systematic survey of 75 retail outlets and their PHP (and antibiotic) inventories piloted in Khulna has identified over 180 products: 72 containing probiotics, 11 prebiotics, 72 vitamins and immuno-stimulants and 14 antibiotics. Most (81%) probiotics (by volume and value) are used to manage pond water quality (variously directed to water and soil/sediment treatment); 11 of a total of 58 such products were also counter-intuitively simultaneously recommended for in-feed application whilst the remaining 14 probiotics (19%) were recommended exclusively for in-feed administration. Qualitative survey work also revealed that most farmers and retailers categorize PHPs according to functional rather than compositional characteristics with implications for inventory collection methods. A further corollary is that farmers will select and judge efficacy of most probiotics according to water quality indicators e.g. smell, appearance, test and simple ammonia/ nitrite colorimetric tests. Such testing is an unregulated ancillary service frequently offered by PHP retailers (or independent small 'laboratories' in India) as a basis for product prescriptions; particularly to small-scale farmers working at intermediate (semi) intensification levels who show a greater propensity to procure and apply products in a responsive mode. Conversely, more intensive farmers are likely to adhere more closely to manufacturer prophylactic application recommendations resulting in significantly higher application rates and associated expenditure.
In Bangladesh recent efforts to promote small-holder shrimp intensification (and thereby demand for PHPs and other inputs) have been led by a multi-national company providing a full technical support package including regular localised extension-advice, feed, seed, probiotics (and an option to purchase harvested shrimp) to farmers within discrete clusters. Farmers are recommended a sequence of 4-5 soil/water and one in-feed probiotics manufactured and imported by the company. The project has audited over 80 such farms with higher adoption rates observed in areas with low background-levels of traditional semi-intensive farming with their attendant collective biosecurity problems. With some notable differences, this model is close to the norm observed in Andhra Pradesh. A comparative analysis of these two regional contexts should provide further insights into likely sustainability in Bangladesh with a record of failed intensification attempts i.e. extensive and semi-intensive production remains the norm practiced by, at best estimates over 200,000 mainly small-scale farmers. 
To facilitate regional and species comparisons, progress has also been made in development of a normalised classification system of production-intensification. For shrimp this accounts for widely differing stocking strategies and survival norms along the spectrum extensive to intensive production. Using this system we have identified thresholds below which farmers are unlikely use any PHPs noting that for more extensive farmer's low-input-output production is itself the key health risk-management strategy in the absence of effective disease-diagnostic and biosecurity infrastructure or capacity. Thus development sample-frames designed to improve the generalisability of future survey work will be focus exclusively on farms operating above this threshold.
A total of 33 companies were recorded supplying commercial probiotics to the shrimp retail sector in Khulna. All are manufactured in third-party countries with production activities largely limited to some (re-)packaging and associated branding and labelling in Bangladesh. Most (21) products were exported from neighbouring India by 12 companies with manufacturing concentrated near Hyderabad and secondly Chennai (many with origins in livestock sectors). This was followed by Thailand exporting 7 products manufactured by 3 companies. Many manufacturers are multi-national with regional production centres underscoring the highly global nature of these value-chains, and potential for genotype-environment interactions associated with the 'external' origins and development of commonly used bacterial strains.
This upstream value-chain analysis is on-going, whilst the retail level surveys piloted in Khulna are being replicated in the other regional research areas. Preliminary findings indicate the more responsive application approach (described above) for water quality management predominates in intensive catfish polycultures (with tilapias and carps) in Mymensingh. Intensity limitations and the lower unit value of harvest limit application PHPs in lower-intensive fertilised semi-intensive carp, tilapia systems as well as freshwater prawn systems (where cannibalistic tendencies of the species limit intensification. These factors and the nascent nature of aquaculture underscore the absence of demand or commercial supply of aquatic PHPs in Kenya at the present time. Consequently focus here is on understanding potential for future demand in tilapia pond and cage aquaculture sectors and mapping of livestock PHP supply chains as a likely entry point e.g. for in-feed probiotics and immune-stimulants. 
Further understanding of the basis for farmer decision making behaviour and autonomy in health management practices will gained from a systematic farmer health management survey being piloted in Bangladesh and India. Correlations between health outcomes, production conditions and PHP usage will help determine efficacy-indicators in randomised control PHP/ placebo trials (RCT) now scheduled to be implemented in 2018. In Andhra Pradesh a wide variation in salinity conditions is likely to influence probiotic efficacy and will considered in the stratification of experimental design.
Over 100 PHP samples have been collected in Bangladesh and India. Bacterial content of probiotic products is being analysed for comparison against package claims and shortlisting of higher potential products for RCT. Methods/ protocols for screening the monosaccharide content of commercial polysaccharides and novel immuno-stimulatory bioactive compounds (algae, sugar beet) have developed and analysis initiated on the above samples. The pre-biotic affect of PHPs collected in Bangaldesh are also being assessed on L. reuteri strains as a model.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Considerable progress has been made in preliminary stakeholder assessment, needs analysis and linked to this a draft communication strategy developed. A first stakeholder workshop with PHP supply-chain actors was held in Dhaka in December 2016 whilst individual meetings with sectoral support and regulatory bodies were conducted during a recent joint-mission to Andhra Pradesh.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>850723D4-791B-4207-A7E6-5C263DBAFC67</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58cab31c5d4af7.30609825</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.facebook.com/AquacultureProbiotics</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N005082/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18D298A9-FFE3-432F-B077-E3B703272E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemical engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E2AC43A0-F15F-4F00-8557-FB2D01D65940</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Immunology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
