The Austrian aristocrat Baron Raimund von Stillfried was the most important foreign photographer of the Meiji period (1868-1912) and trained a generation of Japanese practitioners at his studio in Yokohama. He played a pivotal role in the rise of the industry and the international image of Japanese culture, as well as the adoption of the technology in official government circles in Japan. From 1871 to 1883, his studio in Yokohama dominated the export market in souvenir photographs of Japan. This was a crucial period of unprecedented change and social debate in Japan when photography became widely available to domestic practitioners and markets. This study will chart the history of his studio and its shifting fortunes both in the local and international context. It will present the first reliable and detailed account of his work and career in Japan, the changing nature of his practice, and his significant contribution to the emergence of the Japanese photographic industry. Stillfried's career was also marked by numerous public scandals and business failures which highlight the tensions and fierce competition which underpinned the entire photographic industry. In sum, the lack of a thorough, grounded study of this important photographer has been a fundamental lacuna in both Japanese and Western-language scholarship.\n\nTo date, Western photographers active in nineteenth-century Japan have either been studied largely in terms of the colonialist impetus for exotic imagery or in isolation from the political and social changes within Japan. Little attention has been directed to their shifting roles and allegiances, from producers of exotic souvenirs for the international market to expert advisers and conduits for the transmission of modern visual practices to Japan. Stillfried's career provides a rich case study of the role of foreigners as cultural advisers in nineteenth-century Asia, providing domestic photographers, governments and officials with the expertise and skills necessary to display their own culture in their own terms to international audiences. This study is particularly concerned with the role of expatriate foreigners as conduits for the dissemination and adoption of photography in nineteenth-century Japan. It aims to emphasize the complex negotiations and shifting allegiances of Western photographers in the context of the growth of a highly competitive Japanese photographic industry.\n\nThis study will also argue that disciplinary divisions based on national, cultural or geographical boundaries have marginalized the significance of such cultural itinerants as promoters of photography and visual interpreters of Asian societies. Stillfried's career and work will be examined within the context of the Yokohama photographic industry and the emergence of a competitive and highly skilled generation of Japanese photographers. It will consider the practice of such little-known photographers as Uchida Kuichi, Shimooka Renjo and Kusakabe Kinbei and their success in attracting foreign customers to their studios. In so doing, this study will examine the cross-cultural significance of photography as a visual technology central to the emergence of Japanese modernity.\n\nThis book will make a major contribution toward a burgeoning field of scholarship central to current debates on Japanese visual culture and the role of European photographers in colonial Asia. It represents the culmination of a decade of intellectual engagement and personal skills development, underpinned by rigorous archival work around the world and theoretical debate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Over the past decade there has been an unprecedented public and academic interest in the field of early Japanese photography. Several major exhibitions have taken place around the world which have been widely reviewed and well attended by the public (Houston-2003, Boston-2004, Yokohama-2007, Alberta, Canada-2009). I have been invited to contribute catalogue essays for two major exhibitions at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia (2004) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography (2007). Such specialist research has therefore had a direct impact on the public exhibition programs of museums around the world. Although an early career scholar, I believe my research has informed the growing public and institutional interest in such visual histories and archival materials. The Getty Museum's current exhibition on von Stillfried's former teacher in Japan, the Italian-born photographer Felice Beato, and the projects planned at the Freer-Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C., point to the growing prominence of this area of research at some of the most prominent cultural institutions in the world. \n\nI have also been actively involved in bringing my research findings before the wider public and academic communities. Apart from delivering public lectures, I have organized an evening seminar at the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in London to launch a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal History of Photography devoted to photography in nineteenth-century Japan. With more than 130 public delegates, the DAJF had to close bookings to this event. This high number of attendants is representative of the growing public interest in this field of scholarship. I also organized an international two-day conference at the Australian National University in Canberra devoted to early studio photography in Asia. With more than 65 delegates, the event attracted not only an international coterie of professional scholars across various disciplines, but also curators, artists, archivists, collectors and librarians.\n\nThis project will therefore contribute directly to the current public and institutional engaging with a field of growing academic debate. I am committed through conferences, seminars, exhibitions and public lectures to making my research available to the wider public at home and abroad. Although the outcome of this research will be a publication with a major academic press, my track record has already demonstrated the impact of my research on public policy and institutional practice. This research will contribute to an area of tremendous public interest both in Japan and Europe. \n\nAs the economic and cultural ties between Europe and Asia are enhanced by the global traffic of materials, knowledge systems, and not least peoples, it has become all the more important to examine the lives of such cross-cultural go-betweens as Baron von Stillfried. Globalisation has its roots in the nineteenth century with the rise of international transportation and communication networks, which enabled new kinds of artistic careers and cultural understandings. Such research bespeaks of common histories across national borders which help foster ties between the United Kingdom and Japan. \n\nRecent major exhibitions in Yokohama and Tokyo point to the rising academic and public interest in Japan in the role played by Western photographers in their emergence as a modern nation. While many Westerners are famous in Japan, being taught in school history programs, very few are known in their home countries. In order for a dialogue to take place, for a common history to be shared, European-language scholarship can serve an important diplomatic role in fostering an appreciation of such historical figures at home and abroad. Having worked with curators, scholars, and librarians in Japan and Europe, I believe such research plays a key role in fost</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture Book Launch at Japan House, Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5FCDCA72-F332-4D82-9E08-1EFC1A7C953D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A book launch for 'A Career of Japan' at Japan House, London.
