Our ability to modify the connections in our brain is called neuroplasticity and it underlies our capacity to learn and develop as well as to heal after experiencing physical or psychological trauma or injury. The precise biological mechanisms underlying plasticity still elude us. However, a clear understanding of how plasticity works will have great implications for clinical neuroscience. Furthering our knowledge of how healthy brains develop and age will directly benefit people who have suffered from a form of brain injury and are trying to stimulate plasticity in order to recover, or are simply stimulating plasticity to prevent decline or enhance cognitive performance.

A number of different techniques are currently being used by clinicians to stimulate plasticity. Essentially, most techniques involve electrical, magnetic or sensory stimulation of a target brain region. If neurons are activated at the same time many times over, then the connections between them get stronger. Conversely, if neurons are not used then their connections lose strength and eventually stop working all together. This is the basis of Hebbian learning and plasticity. Stimulating large brain areas at the same time is a way of activating large populations of neurons so that the connection strengths within the network grow. However, as we do not fully understand the mechanisms underlying the changes we see in network plasticity, we are unable to optimise these methods so that people can get the maximum benefit from their treatment.

Applying mathematical and computational techniques to biological problems is a very powerful tool for exploring how these complicated systems operate. The brain is now recognised as a highly dynamic and complex organ and data analysis methods designed to cope with its' complexity are constantly evolving. Mathematical modelling work at the microscopic level of individual cells has provided great insight into the biological processes underlying chemical reactions within a cell or between small numbers of cells. So far, these models have not been scaled up to include network interactions spanning over whole brain regions in response to different kinds of stimulation. We have recently developed a model of plasticity in the brain that was able to predict behavioural changes in people responding to two different kinds of stimulation. However, the model could not account for the chemical changes happening within the brain and so we were unable to understand how these were related to the behavioural observations. I am proposing to develop a mathematical model that is able to account for changes in activity, connectivity and chemical concentrations within the brain in response to different kinds of external stimuli. Studying the response of the model to different kinds of stimulation will allow me to to make predictions about how the brain will react to therapies used to boost plasticity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neuroplasticity and neural connectivity are key to development across the lifespan. Plasticity occurs in healthy brains and underpins our ability to learn and form memories. Impaired connectivity has been associated with a range of pathological states. A number of clinical therapies aimed at stimulating plasticity in the brain are currently in use; however optimisation of such techniques has been hindered due to a limited understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms of plasticity. It is thought the neurotransmitters GABA and Glutamate play a key role in facilitating reorganisation of neuronal networks. Despite this, there is currently no mathematical model linking the synaptic elements of plasticity at the microscopic level to the macroscopic scale observed using clinical imaging technologies such as EEG or fMRI. I propose to develop a new biophysical model of neural activation and connectivity incorporating the release of neurotransmitters. I will use Statistical Mechanics to derive the mean field approximation of a neural mass which includes the synaptic dynamics of GABA and Glutamate as well as Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms within and between the masses. I will use this model to better understand and improve current clinical interventions intended to stimulate plasticity for the purpose of rehabilitation or neuroenhancement. 

The proposed model will be validated with empirical data observed using fMRI and MRS data acquired at 7T. I will use a well-established stimulation paradigm (tDCS) which has previously been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and increase functional connectivity as well as affecting neurotransmitter levels. The imaging data will be used to infer the parameters of the model using parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection techniques. As a proof of concept, I will use the model to make predictions about optimising the effectiveness and safety of tDCS paradigms which will be testable by a neuroimaging lab.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Transcranial direct current stimulation is becoming an increasingly common technique used to deliver neuromodulation for rehabilitation following brain injury, neuroprotection from ageing and even cognitive enhancement within the general population. It is thought that it, and other methods, such as repetitive stimulation, work by altering or facilitating plasticity mechanisms, that in turn allow brain connections to reorganise. To date no standard protocols for delivering neuromodulation exist, partly because a model linking neurotransmitter release and connectivity changes has not been developed to fully explore this relationship. This fellowship will allow me to deliver that model. I aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of plasticity within the cortex at the level of functional networks and then use this information to directly affect treatment protocols in this population with the aim of minimising patient recovery times and costs whilst improving clinical outcomes. Optimising non-invasive brain stimulation through an understanding of their mechanistic effect on physiology will allow application of such techniques to a wider domain, e.g. healthy subjects to provide a neuroprotective effect against cognitive decline as a consequence of normal ageing. This is a current area of research with the potential for huge societal impact in terms of improving standard of life for our ageing population. Therefore, direct beneficiaries of this work include all of the patient groups mentioned above as well as the clinicians that treat them and the engineering companies who manufacture devices used to deliver the stimuli. 

More generally, understanding cortical network plasticity is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. Clinical and cognitive neuroscience groups are currently investigating the mechanisms of plasticity in order to develop new treatments for a number of degenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease). A mathematical model that is able to account for changes in plasticity in response to stimuli would directly contribute to the research in these fields and allow testing of stimulation based therapies in a computational setting to aid human trials. 

Finally, the development of a mathematical model that accounts for neurotransmitter release as well as measures of connectivity that can be directly related to current neuroimaging data will progress the field of computational neuroscience as well as encouraging more cross-collaboration between these groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>315174</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P014445/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
