Due to the growth of big data, machine learning methods have become increasingly important tools in a wide range of applications including bioinformatics, computer vision, economics, and medicine. This project investigates machine learning for extracting useful information from fMRI data to help clinicians make more accurate diagnoses for certain brain diseases and develop more effective treatments for them. 

Currently, deep learning is the most popular machine learning method. However, it has highly complex architectures and needs vast amounts of data to learn a huge number of parameters. This leads to difficulties when the number of data examples available (n) is very small compared to the number of features in each data example (p), which is the &amp;quot;large p, small n&amp;quot; problem. Indeed, Geoff Hinton, the godfather of deep learning, said recently: &amp;quot;One problem we still haven't solved is getting neural nets to generalise well from small amounts of data&amp;quot;. 

Most existing solutions for the &amp;quot;large p, small n&amp;quot; problem represent data as vectors. With growing data dimensionality, such vector-based methods become inadequate for severe &amp;quot;large p, small n&amp;quot; problems, e.g., machine learning on fMRI data. fMRI data are sequences of 3D volumes, i.e., 4D data. They are noisy, big, and multidimensional, making comprehensive manual analysis infeasible and machine learning challenging. A typical whole-brain fMRI scan sequence has tens of millions features (voxel measurements), with a file size over 100MB. For such data, even a simple linear basis needs tens of millions parameters (deep learning will need far more) but in practice we often only have sequences for dozens of individuals available in a particular fMRI study due to high cost. 

Therefore, we aim to develop a new machine learning method for severe cases of &amp;quot;large p, small n&amp;quot; for multidimensional data such as whole-brain fMRI. We will take a tensor-based approach, where a tensor refers to a multidimensional array. Tensor-based methods have a much smaller number of parameters than vector-based ones. For typical whole-brain fMRI data above, a tensor-based multilinear basis needs only a few hundreds parameters, several orders of magnitude smaller than those needed by a vector-based, linear basis. We will generalise the state-of-the-art sparse feature learning methods for vector input to tensor-based ones for tensor input.

This will be the first study to learn sparse features directly from tensor representations of multidimensional data in a scalable and interpretable way. We will apply our algorithms to a large fMRI dataset on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to accomplish two major tasks: prediction and interpretation. Firstly, we will detect ADHD and classify its subtypes via a small number of automatically selected voxels. Secondly, collaborating with a brain imaging expert, we will analyse the connectivity of brain regions corresponding to selected voxels to interpret the classification results, gain insights, and identify biomarkers to assist clinicians in further diagnosis and treatment. Our results will be fully reproducible with the dataset in the public domain and our software to be released as open source. The success of this project will advance the state-of-the-art of machine learning and provide a new enabling software tool to applications with severe &amp;quot;large p, small n&amp;quot; problems such as medical imaging with high-cost scanners (e.g., MRI or 3D mammography machines) and translational bioinformatics with big genomic data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will contribute to strengthening the UK's world-leading position in both machine learning and brain imaging, with impact spanning four main areas.
 
A. Economy: Machine learning is an increasing economic driving force. With big data as the &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot;, machine learning is the engine turning big data into great power in artificial intelligence applications for the next industrial revolution. This project focuses on expensive but limited &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; on which the state-of-the-art machine learning methods are having difficulties. Its success will lead to significant cost saving in data collection such as fMRI scans (about 400 GBP per scan) and other expensive medical devices. Successful machine learning from a smaller amount of data will greatly help with the analysis of rare diseases or disorders such as prion disease, where it is impossible to get large numbers of subjects. It will also enable data exploitation for new data analytic problems such as genomic data analysis in translational bioinformatics for personalised medicines. On the other hand, this project will help brain disease diagnosis, which will lead to significant healthcare cost savings and reduce many other direct or indirect costs. For example, autism and dementia alone cost the UK economy 32 and 17 billion GBP per year, respectively, and they both can benefit from this project. In the long term, this project will also benefit pharmaceutical companies with interest in developing drugs for brain diseases.
 
B. Society: Machine learning and artificial intelligence have significantly impacted our society in the past few decades. Nowadays, our everyday life has been significantly changed by and heavily depends on machine learning, from shopping, socialising, entertaining, to healthcare, banking, job hunting. This project will advance machine learning technology and thus further drive the impacts of machine learning on improving our quality of life, with healthcare being the most direct area. It targets brain diseases, such as autism and dementia, which are major societal challenges affecting children and the elderly respectively. It will help clinicians better detect and classify such brain diseases, understand their causes and different patterns, and eventually find effective treatments for their patients. In general, it will also help the diagnosis and treatment of rare or new diseases where only a limited number of data examples are available. 

C. Knowledge: This project will advance the state-of-the-art research in tensor-based machine learning and whole-brain fMRI data analysis, which are both areas of great importance. The findings of this project will also impact closely-related research fields including bioinformatics, computer vision, NLP, speech and language modelling, and even mathematics and statistics. Furthermore, while focusing on brain imaging applications, the method to be developed is general in nature like Lasso or Elastic Net so it will benefit researchers in many other areas of science and engineering in solving problems of similar nature. This project is interdisciplinary itself, which will foster more interdisciplinary works along this direction and beyond. 

D. People: This project will have a positive impact on the careers of the PI, RA, and collaborator. We will all gain additional knowledge and experience in machine learning, tensor analysis, and brain imaging. Such exposure will help us build a larger network of potential collaborators for future funding proposals. It will advance the RA's career with additional skills and benefit the PI's students via small projects on related problems. Despite his recent success with Hong Kong grants, the PI has not yet been involved in UK-funded projects. Having an EPSRC first grant is a very important step in his academic career, helping him consolidate his new lecturer position and raise his internationally profile in machine learning.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100730</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R014507/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
