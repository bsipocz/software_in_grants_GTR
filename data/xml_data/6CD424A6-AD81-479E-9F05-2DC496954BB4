At fertilization two distinct highly specialised cells, the sperm and the egg, fuse to give rise to an embryo which can subsequently differentiate into numerous cell types that form an adult organism. But how does the embryo know which genes to switch on and when during the development in order to make these highly specialised cells? It turns out that the sperm may contain within its nucleus instruction to the embryo as to which genes to express and when. However, it is not well understood how the sperm is transmitting this information and what exactly is the nature of the information. Our research aims to understand how the sperm is prepared to deliver to the embryo information about gene expression and cell specialization.
 First, by comparing embryos derived from sperm and from sperm precursors, we have shown that the sperm-derived embryos develop 5 times better and are also better at transcribing genes than precursor-derived embryos. This means that the sperm acquires the information about correct embryonic gene expression during its maturation from the precursor. Now we want to find out what is the nature of this information by comparing components present on genes in sperm and sperm precursor cells and finding differences between them. Next, we want to see if this paternal information, embedded in the components present on genes, is still present in the embryos at the time of embryonic gene activation. To test directly the importance of the paternally-inherited information, we want to alter the way the components are associated with genes in the sperm and then monitor if the gene expression pattern in the embryo is altered. Last, we would like to find out if egg factors (the factors contributed from the mother) are important to read the paternal information.
 We believe that our results will have a significant impact on the field of regenerative medicine. For some human diseases/injuries there are currently no treatments applicable, other than a replacement with healthy cells. In order to generate cells for replacement therapies, differentiated cells have to be first switched back (reprogrammed) to an embryonic-like state. However, the frequency of reprogramming is very low. It is likely that this reprogramming inefficiency results from the fact that the somatic cell does not have the instructive information that is normally present in sperm and that dictates the expression of embryonic genes. If we know the nature of the information, one can then provide a somatic cell with such information in order to correct gene expression in reprogrammed cells, and therefore ultimately hope to increase the efficiency of derivation of cells for transplantation. Additionally, it has been shown that improper information about embryonic gene expression in the sperm can be associated with some cases of male infertility. Therefore, the outcome of our research may also help to prevent/treat male infertility cases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project investigates the nature of paternal nucleus programming that underlies successful embryonic development. We have shown that mature sperm is 5 times better than spermatids in supporting Xenopus embryo development, illustrating the programming process associated with sperm maturation. We will use this unique system, where these two haploid cells exhibit different developmental potential, to reveal the nature of sperm programming. The deposition of epigenetic marks on paternal chromatin during sperm maturation will be analysed by ChIP-Seq on sperm and spermatid. Subsequently, we will compare the presence of these marks with the differential embryonic gene expression observed in sperm- and spermatid-derived embryos. Next, we will test what fraction of epigenetic marks present in the paternal nucleus is carried over to and propagated by the embryo. Ultimately, we will functionally test the role of gene marking in the sperm on the future embryonic gene expression and we will investigate what are the egg factors responsible for the recognition and maintenance of the paternally-inherited marks. Our results will provide functional evidence for paternal programming, and will also allow the generation of epigenetic maps of sperm/spermatids and corresponding embryos in Xenopus. We believe that the final outcome of our research - understanding the way the paternal nucleus is programmed, has the potential to improve several aspects of human health. First, knowing the epigenome of a cell that is efficiently reprogrammed by the egg will help the design of strategies altering the epigenome of a somatic cell in order to increase the efficiency of nuclear reprogramming. This would improve derivation of patient-specific cells for cell replacement therapies and drug screening. Second, our work will shed light on a recent area of research - the paternal inheritance of epigenetic features across generations, which is likely to influence the public health policy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>It has been hypothesized that epigenetic marks on the sperm chromatin are transmitted to the embryos and that they can pattern future embryonic gene expression. Our research aims to unravel the mechanisms of the epigenetic programming of the paternal nucleus and, importantly, we also want to demonstrate the existence of a functional link between epigenetic marks on the paternal chromatin and future embryonic gene expression. We strongly believe that our results will be important to a wide group of people outside the academics in the immediate field of our research:
1. Academics working in the field of epigenetics and developmental biology
Our work will lead to the generation of epigenetic maps of sperm/spermatids and embryos in Xenopus laevis, which will be an important resource for developmental biologists working on Xenopus.
To address the functionality of sperm programming we will develop a tool allowing one to alter epigenetic marks at a specific genomic location and to have a functional transcriptional and developmental readout. Researchers working in the broad field of epigenetics will be able to benefit from the use of this system in their research.

2. Regenerative medicine
Since our work will reveal the developmentally important epigenetic features of a sperm, our results will have important implications for regenerative medicine. Cells have to be reprogrammed to pluripotency to be then further used to generate all various cells and tissue types which could be used for cell replacement. However, differentiated cells are often resistant to reprogramming. Once knowing sperm epigenome it would be possible to alter the epigenome of a differentiated somatic cell and make it resemble the one of the sperm. This will likely increase the efficiency of reprogramming. People working in the field of regenerative medicine will immediately benefit from our finding, as it will progress their own research. We also think that in 10-15 years our finding may lead to a development of efficient methods of derivation of patient-specific cells for replacement. This would improve not only the health of people suffering from disease, but will also limit the expenditure for drug treatment for disease that could be cured by cell replacement.

3. Researchers working on male infertility and people suffering from certain types of male infertility
Improper programming of the sperm has been associated with some cases of male infertility. Therefore, researchers working on male infertility will be able to benefit from our findings to progress with their research. Furthermore, understanding the basics of the proper programming can in 10-15 years lead to development of new methods allowing treatment of such infertility cases. If so, our results will be beneficiary to couples suffering from these types of male infertility.

4. People researching environmental impacts on human health and people whose lives may be affected by detrimental environmental conditions
Our results will likely reveal the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic traits via the sperm. In other words, this will suggest that some environmental cues can be inherited from the father to the offspring. Such finding will have a significant impact on researchers working on male infertility/human health - researchers could get a better understanding of environmental conditions that are detrimental for the fertility/fitness of the offspring. It can ultimately (10-15 years) lead to a development of a prevention system - circumventing detrimental effects of the environment on transgenerationally inherited defects.

5. People outside science
The possibility of non-genetic inheritance is also of a great importance for the general public awareness, because it changes the current view that only genetic changes are heritable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
