Immigrants are attracted to Italy and especially the Veneto region (in the north-east of Italy) by job opportunities. The majority of immigrants come from North Africa, Eastern Europe, China and Sub-Saharan Africa.
In most cases they have no previous knowledge of the Italian language on arrival and learn it with little or no formal instruction. This research offers a study of the variety of Italian spoken by the Igbo-Nigerians in Padua and the way their previously acquired languages influence their Italian.
I also looked at how and in which situations Igbo immigrants still use their languages when they are among members of the community and the way they code-switch languages both among the Igbo-community and when they speak with Italians. According to different factors, immigrants may abandon their languages in favour of the language/s of the host country or maintain them in their daily life in specific contexts.
Multilingual speakers in postcolonial societies are already used to mixing one or more languages and it is not always possible or useful to analyse switched items as belonging to a language or another, but rather as belonging to one hybrid code. This code-switching behaviour may be retained or new patterns created. Newly established immigrant communities can reveal interesting insights on the ways speakers reshape their linguistic repertoire and their patterns of code-switching.
This study focuses on the analysis of communication strategies in the Italian of Igbo-Nigerian immigrants in Padua (Italy).
The Igbo-Nigerian community is one of the largest immigrant communities in Padua (Fincati, 2005). The Igbo are the second most populous ethnic group of southern Nigeria, an area usually referred as Alaigbo (Igboland) comprising five Nigerian states. The Igbo community in the Veneto region is part of a wider Igbo diaspora, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia; the Igbo diaspora started in the late sixties when the Igbo tried to gain independence in a brutal civil war (1967-1970) and which has continued until the present day as a consequence of an economic crisis.
The community's linguistic repertoire comprises Igbo, English, Nigerian Pidgin English (plus, in some cases, another Nigerian lingua franca, such as Yoruba), Italian and Veneto dialect. The analysis is based on two substantial corpora: a corpus of interviews in Italian and a corpus of conversations in Igbo, Nigerian Pidgin English, English, Italian and the Veneto dialect among members of the community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in the 'Pathways to impact' I have identified the following beneficiaries from my research beyond academia: 
(1) Local institutions and practitioners in the city of Padua and the Veneto region which deal with issues of immigration and cultural mediation. Contacts with Padua City Council and the association Orizzonti have been made. I will produce a plain-Italian booklet with a summary of the results of my research and will give talks and recommendations).
(2) Teachers of Italian L2 for adult immigrant learners. Relying on the contacts I have made with Padua City Council and associations that organise Italian language classes, I will give presentations on the results of my research to improve their understanding of the multilingual linguistic background of different immigrant communities and issues of interference from previously acquired languages in the acquisition of the Italian language. 
(3) Secondary school students in Padua. I am planning to approach head teachers of three secondary schools in Padua and organise a talk on multilingualism in the city and its surroundings. This will increase awareness on multiculturalism and fill the gap in the institutional syllabus.
(4) The Nigerian community in Padua. I have already engaged in discussions on a complementary school and provided recommendations on issues of language maintenance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My book has not been published yet, so my planned impact is yet to come.
