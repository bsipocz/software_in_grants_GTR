The project culminates with an exhibition in three regions of Wales and brings together material from the local history sites which forms the basis for three regional exhibitions. The project transfers knowledge from findings and methods in two previous AHRC projects. The project seeks to strengthen linkages between museums and Facebook groups as a means for bringing non-traditional audiences into the museums, as well as empowering and actively involving Facebook groups in the process. The project provides curatorial training for participating groups. The exhibiting museums and local history Facebook groups are in South, North and Central Wales. It satisfies statutory remits for the Museums involved and will enhance social cohesion and participation at the community level in the joint preservation of the historical memory of Wales. It will inform both local and national cultural policy initiatives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Museum Impacts:
*An increase in museum attendance and participation of groups which previously were regarded as 'hard-to-reach'. 
*The development of a method which can be used more generally as a mode of delivery and training and which subsequently can become policy of the Museum of Wales.
*The development of design arising the 'street exhibitions' which can subsequently be utilised by the museum to develop commercial offshoots for travelling and local exhibitions 
*The promotion of a shared sense purpose linking the community and the museum in the task of preserving the oral and collective memories of Welsh local history. It positions the national museum as a leading partner in this process. 
*A role for the Museum of Wales in the implementation of policy arising from the the Welsh Governments 'Future Generations Act'.
*An enhanced social media capacity strengthening the outreach for National museum's publicity and programme.
*The strengthening by example of the Museum's place at the centre of the Welsh government's various arts and poverty policies and programmes. 
*A dedicated section on the Museum website leading to a wider understanding of both the method and its practical application in these specific circumstances. 
*A 4000 word article for the Museum website outlining the plan the project the issues and the general observations regarding the method and it implementation in this particular instance. 
Community Impacts
*Arising from the central positioning attached by this project to local Facebook group, a subsequent empowering, legitimating and practical role for these groups in the provision of local historical knowledge. 
*Learning of new skills which will enhance the skills available to community groups and individuals. 
*The establishment of formal and informal linkages between multiple Facebook groups, leading to increased links and inter-action across similarly tasked Facebook groups.
*Stronger links between Facebook groups and local museums and media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R000026/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
