It affects around 1% of the world's population over the age of 60. 

In the long term, medical therapies for PD are often unsatisfactory. There has therefore been heightened interest in surgical options, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), which involves direct electrical stimulation of deep brain structures by metallic electrodes that are inserted into the brain and subsequently connected to a stimulator that is implanted in the chest wall. DBS has proven to be a very successful therapy. It is proposed that DBS works by normalizing abnormal patterns of communication between deep brain structures and other brain areas involved in movement, but experimental evidence for this is at present lacking.

Unfortunately the effectiveness of DBS is can be limited by side effects. To target treatment better we need a clearer understanding of the electrical mechanisms through which different brain areas communicate and how abnormalities of this may lead to specific symptoms PD. Furthermore we need to understand how the function of these networks may be improved by DBS.

My proposed project aims to shed light on these important questions. I will study patients who have undergone DBS surgery and have electrodes implanted in deep brain areas allowing us to record deep brain activity. We will simultaneously record superficial brain activity using a non-invasive, detailed imaging technique known as magnetoencephalography (MEG). By comparing the signals from deep and superficial brain areas, we can determine how these different brain areas interact and communicate, and more importantly how this interaction is influenced by tasks such as movement, medication and DBS.

Crucially by correlating clinical impairments with the communication patterns between different brain areas we can determine whether abnormal communication between specific brain areas relates to specific symptoms in individual patients. The eventual aim is to identify brain areas or networks that contribute to specific movement or thought symptoms in PD. 

My eventual aim is to improve DBS therapy and to reduce side effects by tailoring stimulation to selectively modulate those brain circuits that cause a patient's individual symptoms. This work will therefore be an important step towards better understanding how abnormal brain interactions contribute to the development of PD and furthermore this understanding will guide us towards developing more specific and tailored mechanisms of DBS which target specific brain networks and therefore symptoms, so as to reduce unwanted side effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Here I will test two hypotheses. First, that different clinical impairments in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) relate to distinct basal ganglia-cortical circuits identifiable through their preferred frequency of interaction and their topography. Second, that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) improves these impairments by modulating coupling across these circuits. To this end I will record local field potentials (LFPs) from electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of post-surgical PD patients whilst simultaneously performing magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using source reconstruction techniques I will reconstruct electrical activity from cortical areas and compute spectral coherence with electrical activity from the STN. 

I propose two experiments. In the first I will employ the Posner task in order to determine whether the previously defined alpha frequency STN-cortical network is involved in orienting attention to visuo-spatial cues and is dependent on dopamine. In the second experiment I will perform DBS at therapeutically effective and non-effective frequencies in order to determine specifically how STN-cortical networks are influenced by DBS. In order to facilitate this, we have developed a special amplifier that allows simultaneous stimulation and recording of LFP signals. Furthermore, we will also rely on a number of existing engineering methods to remove the stimulation artifact from the MEG channels prior to performing source reconstruction. 

Finally, by correlating motor and cognitive parameters with patterns of STN-cortical coupling I will gain valuable insight into: 1) the involvement of specific STN-cortical loops in mediating the symptoms of PD and 2) the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.Patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease

This research will be most relevant to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). About 120,000 people in the UK suffer with Parkinson's disease, which, in addition to tremor, causes slowness and stiffness of movement. More than 90% of those seeking medical attention report disability. In the UK, the costs of treatment (health and social care) have been estimated at between &amp;pound;560,000 and &amp;pound;1,600,000 million per 100,000 population (McMahon et al., 2000).
Drug treatments begin to fail after 5-10 years in about 80% of patients. Brain pacemakers that deliver electrical stimulation to an area deep in the brain called the basal ganglia have recently been developed as an alternative treatment in those patients in whom drug treatment is no longer fully effective. Presently, about 10-20 % of patients with Parkinson's Disease are considered eligible, but the treatment still has side-effects and could be more effective. 
The proposed research programme aims to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD and also of the mechanisms by which DBS exerts its therapeutic effects. Evidence is mounting that there are several functional sub-loops between the STN and cerebral cortical regions, distinguished by their resonant frequencies and cortical topographies (Fogelson et al., 2006). We aim to define how these circuits relate to particular functions and symptom complexes. In other words, these circuits may provide a novel marker for disease state and severity with the resulting benefit of improving diagnosis and prognostication. 
It should also be possible to hone the spatio-temporal character of stimulation so that it is focussed on each patient's dominant impairments, hence improving the efficacy of DBS and reducing side effects. The resulting benefits would include an improvement in symptoms and quality of life. These goals are likely to take in the order of 3-5 years to realise.

2. Benefit to other patient groups
everal other patient groups may also benefit indirectly from the insights made in our research. These include patients with conditions that have shown to benefit from DBS such as essential tremor, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain and headache. If our hypothesis of specific PD symptoms arising from specific STN-cortical networks is experimentally supported, this would pave the way for thinking about other neurological and psychiatric illnesses benefitted by DBS in a similar light. 

3. Healthcare Industry

Our findings may be beneficial to the medical technology industry and especially to companies manufacturing DBS stimulators. If we find that specific symptoms in PD relate to specific STN-cortical networks, the next logical step for DBS stimulator manufacturers would be to generate new and improved stimulators that target specific network abnormalities responsible for a patient's individual symptoms. 
Furthermore, an important aim of proposed training is that it will provide me with the training to become a future academic leader, hence improving the skills base in the UK.

4. Wider public

The public has shown a substantial interest in the recent advances in medical technology and neuroscience as demonstrated by the frequent media reporting as well as a large number of medical and neuroscience themed documentaries, exhibitions and books. Our research may benefit the wider public by fuelling this interest and by providing further insights into how advances in medical technology contribute to improvements in health care. We also hope to generate interest in related topics such as the concept of Brain-Machine-Interfaces for treating disease.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with MEG centre Analysis group at the University of Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:id>7D6C2265-AEB9-4D9B-9C06-62299D49982E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs as yet.
