aircraft are well known to be noisy machines that limits their acceptability to people living close to their operation, such as wind farms and airports. This limitation of course has significant implications for the growth of the aerospace and renewable energy sectors, which is vital to the UK economy as a whole. Wind turbines and aircraft have common noise generation mechanisms, namely the interaction between the airfoil blades and wings with turbulent flow around it. 

Conventional airfoils have straight leading and trailing edges, which according to recent research by the authors of this proposal, is the noisiest geometrical configuration. Significant noise reductions in airfoil noise have been obtained by introducing serrations (or undulations) into the trailing edge and leading edge geometries. In separate studies, introducing riblets onto the airfoil surface (very fine grooves) have also been shown to produce significant reductions in drag. It is reasonable to assume that airfoil drag and its noise radiation are connected, although this has never been formally investigated. An investigation into this association is one of the objectives of this work.

This project will seek to combine these three technologies into a single airfoil design for the simultaneous reduction of leading edge and trailing edge noise whilst preserving aerodynamic performance. This optimisation process will necessitate a fundamental understanding into their noise reductions mechanisms individually in order to ensure that their combined benefits are at least additive or may combine to be more effective than the sum of their benefits individually. The outcome of this work is a new generation of aerofoils with noise control at the heart of their design.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254837</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Israel, State of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Next generation aerofoil by hybrid active and passive flow controls</gtr:description><gtr:id>46AA320F-F1D5-4574-ABD1-13AEE142E767</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Oksana Stalnov and I have achieved some preliminary results on the hybrid leading edge serration and plasma actuator on the reduction of aerofoil turbulence-leading edge interaction noise.

The open days in Brunel provide a good opportunity to inform the general public about the innovative research conducted in the area of aircraft noise reduction. I have the opportunity to demonstrate the plasma actuators that could be used for aircraft engine fan noise reduction, which generates interests among the visitors and encourages more students to engage in the STEM education. 

Given the close proximity of Brunel University to Heathrow Airport and the noise-sensitive areas that are under the flight paths, my research on the plasma actuators (EP/K002309/1) and serration technology (EP/N018737/1) that aims to reduce fan noise radiated from the aircraft engine has a high potential to achieve significant social impact. This is because a lot of these visitors are from the local area who are genuinely concerned about the impact of the aviation noise and are interested to know more about the recent trend in the technological development. My EPSRC-funded research is well placed to demonstrate that the academic research community as well as the government are motivated to continuously develop the latest technology to address this important societal issue.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df5ec55a4ae2.54960128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The start date of this EPSRC project is officially at 30 April 2016. A suitable candidate for the postdoctoral research fellow has been recruited in May 2016. Because the postdoc is a non-EU national, he needs to apply the Tier-2 visa before he could come to the UK and work on this project. Although the application form and the supporting documents were submitted in good times by the postdoc from Singapore, the approval process took longer than expected due to several issues. He finally obtained his clearance to come to the UK in early December 2016, which is the date when he started to work on this project.

In order to maintain the progress, I was supported by two of my PhD students between May - December 2016 to set up some experiments and obtained important results pertaining to this project. There are two areas that can be classified as the key findings for this project so far:

(1) We have invented and developed in this project the &amp;quot;dual-flap angles&amp;quot; concept for the serrated trailing edge to improve the broadband noise reduction of aerofoil at low pressure loading condition. After testing repeatedly in the aeroacoustic facility, larger broadband noise reduction can indeed be achieved by the &amp;quot;dual-flap angles&amp;quot; serration than the conventional &amp;quot;non-flap&amp;quot; serration at high frequency between 2 - 20 kHz, thus proving that this new concept represents the next level of the owl-inspired serration technology. In addition, the scientific mechanism for the noise reduction by this new concept is very interesting and has the potential to improve the understanding of the noise reduction by serration. We will present the results in the upcoming Aviation 2017 (23rd AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustic Conference, 5-9 June 2017).

(2). The owl also inspire the use of serration on the leading edge to reduce the turbulence interaction noise. So far, these serrations were formed by cutting the sawtooth/wavy pattern directly into the aerofoil main body. We develop a new &amp;quot;add-on&amp;quot; concept to insert the thin flat plates (with serration pattern) into the leading edge of the aerofoil. After an extensive test campaign, we discovered that the interaction noise reduction can still be achieved by the flat plate concept, although the level of reduction is not as high as the conventional &amp;quot;cut-in&amp;quot; type serration. Nevertheless, the &amp;quot;add-on&amp;quot; concept has a great advantage in terms of the ease of implementation and manufacturing, which has a potential to attract the fan-based industries. We will present the results in the upcoming Aviation 2017 (23rd AIAA/CEAS Aeroacoustic Conference, 5-9 June 2017).

The postdoc is currently working on the combined leading/trailing edges serrations to improve the aerodynamic and aeroacoustics performances of a cambered aerofoil representative of the industrial blade. The findings of this work will be reported in the next round of the RCUK Researchfish submission period 2018.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will actively engage with our industrial project partners for this EPSRC project (Airbus aerospace and Vestas wind turbine) to disseminate key findings in this project. We will also explore the routes and steps that we should take in order to transfer the new technology developed in this project from the laboratory to a full scale prototype.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FF97CE42-00C0-4A26-8128-C6FEE11C9D17</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e32906b174.66798155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A plasma actuator can be configured such that the travelling waves it generated can either enhance or deteriorate the flow. For all of the experiments carried out in the EP/K002309/1 project, the plasma actuators were optimised to the configurations such that they can suppress the wake vortex shedding and reduce the turbulence level of the boundary layer in order to produce a less-turbulent and steady flow. 

Measuring the flow separation noise is one of the main objectives for the current EP/N018737/1 project. To develop a &amp;quot;triggering&amp;quot; method for the boundary layer without subjecting it to large pressure loadings, we are developing a novel method to use the plasma actuator to produce an adverse flow (large scale boundary layer separation) in an otherwise laminar flow condition. This will enable us to study the leading edge and boundary layer separation noise without the need of extensive modification of the current wind tunnel facility.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A28F50AE-378E-4912-A20D-7568700A3530</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As stated in the &amp;quot;Collaborations and Partnerships&amp;quot; section, the limitation on performing aeroacoustic measurements on high angle of attack, and large pressure loadings for aerofoil by an open jet wind tunnel can be overcome by using the plasma actuator to generate a large scale boundary layer separation artificially. This advanced experimental technique would enable us to study and measure the flow separation noise - something that has hitherto not been investigated adequately in the research community due to limitation in the capability of the wind tunnel facility.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9b731b75786.78678961</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Use of plasma actuators to generate various base-flow conditions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F9E0336-E5A4-487F-A202-CBE59C259A47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aerofoil Broadband Noise Reduction by the Serrated Trailing Edges with Spanwise Split/Variable Pitch Angles</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/902035fa24e1701169289fb8e959c7f2"><gtr:id>902035fa24e1701169289fb8e959c7f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodhead, P C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9bb6ec7a4e9.88420227</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EB06E60-9862-463A-875E-F80123C24D33</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leading edge noise reduction of thin aerofoil by add-on serration</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/879f8416bfcde27f44aa798618f1121a"><gtr:id>879f8416bfcde27f44aa798618f1121a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Juknevicius A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c9bbcb009806.38023502</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N018737/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B148AA4C-48F9-4B18-90F6-641750F725A1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Acoustics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ED6338AE-3457-45D6-90CA-B994C3CF422B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aerodynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
