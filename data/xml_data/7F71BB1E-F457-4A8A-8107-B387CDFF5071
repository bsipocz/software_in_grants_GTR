The total economic cost of cancer in the EU was more than &amp;pound;99 billion in 2009 [1] and the cost of diagnosing and treating cancer in the UK is expected to reach &amp;pound;15.3 billion by 2021 [2]. Conventional cancer surgery treatment suffers from various complications such as pain, damage to nearby tissues and possible thrombosis. Other common cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, have the limitation of drug resistance, lack of selectivity, and lack of solubility. Given these issues associated with treatment safety and effectiveness, scientists are applying tremendous efforts towards new approaches in the fight against cancer. The use of nanotechnology in cancer treatment offers some exciting possibilities.

The proposed research involves innovation and collaboration among cross-disciplinary experts (materials science, physics and cancer research) to resolve some of the major challenges in the application of nanotechnology to cancer. The PI proposes to develop a novel technology that allows incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles (NP) into a hydrogel without using toxic chemicals or surfactants, while ensuring the NP dispersion and stability. The resulting material will be an injectable &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; system useful for certain cancer treatment, with multiple functions including 1) controlled drug delivery 2) inducing heat under an externally applied magnetic field and 3) facilitating bio-imaging.

Collaboration with project partners are integral components of this proposal and will directly contribute to advancement of our understanding of plasma assisted synthesis of functional nanocomposites. In order to reach out to a wider audience, dissemination plans has been laid out for; publications, participation to conferences, organization of seminar/outreach events as well as promoting the project through online media.

The project team will also actively seek engagement with charities, academic researchers, manufacturers of specialised biomedical materials/devices, and potential end-users in the biomedical and plasma technology, energy, and transport. This networking will aim to form the basis for future collaborations on research projects targeting more focused, application specific outcomes (i.e. large-scale industrial production of nanocomposite materials, multi-functional nanocomposites: e.g. conductive composites for light striking prevention).

The research activities promote collaborations with overseas institutions (e.g. China) will greatly contribute to the international development with China hence enhancing the delivery of impacts. This will also contribute to the education of a globally engaged scientific and engineering workforce capable of performing in an international environment. For instance, the PI and project partners are currently engaged with their respective departments will provide opportunities to educate students (undergraduate and postgraduate levels) in advanced subjects such as biomaterials, advanced materials processing and nanotechnology, so that future workforce generations can be adequately prepared. The project will also enhance the technical, team working and project management skills of the PhD student and research staff involved. He/She will learn about the new challenges cross the disciplinary such as plasma physics, chemistry, nanomaterials/nanocomposite synthesis as well as biomedical and healthcare technology. He/She will have access to the university's commercialization and technology transfer expertise through the Enterprise Development Office. This will enhance their potential for collaboration with industry.

A successful outcome of the project will be to have paved the way for rapid technological exploitation for innovative manufacturing of novel nanocomposites with great potential in more effective multi-modal cancer treatments to help reduce the economic burden of the NHS system. At the appropriate time, a business case will be made to warrant a successful transition from a research based technology to an industrial reality. The translation of new technology resulting from this research to commercialisation and exploitation will be explored in consultation with the Commercial Development team within the Research and Enterprise Directorate at Queen's. The training and development of a highly skilled and educated workforce in important technological sectors will also contribute to an economic impact: the PhD students and postdoctoral researcher will become skilled experts in advanced nanomaterials/functional materials and will be in an ideal position to begin their own research career or contribute in an industrial environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P00394X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
