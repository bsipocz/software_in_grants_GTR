These are mathematical functions that predict how well chemical compounds will act as drugs. QSARs are used to guide the synthesis of new drugs.

The current situation is:
1) There is a vast range of approaches to learning QSARs.
2) It is clear from theory and practice that the best QSAR approach depends on the type of problem.
3) Currently the QSAR scientist has little to guide her/him on which QSAR approach to choose for a specific problem. 

We therefore propose to make a step-change in QSAR research. We will utilise newly available public domain chemoinformatic databases, and in-house datasets, to systematically run extensive comparative QSAR experiments. We will then generalise these results to learn which target-type/ compound-type/ compound-representation /learning-method combinations work best together. 

We do not propose to develop any new QSAR method. Rather, we will learn how to better apply existing QSAR methods. This approach is called &amp;quot;meta-learning&amp;quot;, using machine learning to learn about QSAR leaning. 

We will make the knowledge we learn publically available to guide and improve future QSAR learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Knowledge Production for Better Drug Design

The proposal is an ambitious one: its goal to change the way drug-design research is done, and to make it more efficient and cost-effective.

The most important deliverable of the proposal is to produce knowledge (QSAR-KB) about how to better apply quantitative structure activity (QSAR) methods for drug design. The beneficiaries of this knowledge will drug design practitioners both in industry and the increasing number in the public sector.

We will communicate this knowledge to these beneficiaries by: 
1) Publishing in high-impact journals. 
2) Talking at drug-design conferences. 
3) Project Website

The other project deliverables will also be of direct utility to drug design beneficiaries as they will be made openly available. These will enable drug-designers to:
1) Better develop and evaluate new QSAR methods.
2) Develop their own meta-QSAR systems for application to their own commercially sensitive or proprietary chemoinformatic databases. 
To achieve these applications of the project deliverable we will actively seek to transfer our knowledge and knowhow about meta-learning to the drug-design community. 

We have excellent contacts with the pharmaceutical industry, which we will use to ensure that our research is exploited commercially. ALH is leading the UK partners in the IMI Lead Factory consortium (Dundee, Oxford and Biocity Scotland), which expects to be finalized by the end of 2012. The IMI Lead Factory project is a 160 Million euro public-private consortium consisting of seven major Pharmaceutical companies that proposed to offer 120 industrial scale HTS projects to European academic over the next 5 years with the creation of a screening file of 500,000 novel compounds. 

In addition 2012 ALH founded, Ex Scientia Ltd., a new spin out company focusing on developing novel machine learning methods to automate drug design (Besnard et al., Nature, In Press; PCT/GB2010/05194,0). 


Broader economic benefits

The problem of how best to learn QSARs is of great industrial and medical importance. Drug development is arguably the most important applications of science in the UK. The average cost to bring a new drug to market is ~&amp;pound;500 million. A successful drug can earn &amp;pound;billions a year, and as patent protection is time-limited, even an extra week of protection can be of great financial significance. The UK (both academia and industry) is a leader in QSAR research and chemoinformatics in general as can be seen by its publication record. This project aims to help to maintain this lead.


Health and health sector benefits
 
The deliverables of the proposal will, over the medium term, lead to the faster development of better, and cheaper pharmaceuticals. This will increase the effectiveness of health services. Cost reduction in the delivery of existing services thus freeing up resources to use elsewhere in the health system;


Research capacity building 

The project will train three PDRAs in areas of crucial importance to the future science and industry: drug-design, machine-learning, and the semantic web.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>401412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The results of all the base learning QSAR systems have been put online.

We have worked in close collaboration with our project partners from the University of Brunel and the University of Dundee. Below is a summary of our key outputs.

1. Annotation scheme. We have developed an annotation scheme for the annotation of machine learning experiments that are typically used for the prediction of biological activities of chemical compounds. The annotation scheme consists of descriptors for datasets, machine learners, their predictions and also drag targets. While are several formalisms for the description of datasets and machine learning algorithms already exist, they are generic and not tuned for the prediction of biological activities necessary for drug discovery. For example, the ontology DMOP (Data Mining Optimization), developed within the European e-LICO project (http://www.e-lico.eu/DMOP.html), is sufficient to describe such properties of a dataset as number of data items, feature correlation, etc. However DMOP and other formalism do not provide descriptors that capture information about, for example, diversity of a chemical space. There also exists a classification of drug targets (see ChEMBL: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/target/browser), but it does not capture the functionality of targets or their similarity. Our annotation scheme captures all the essential properties of datasets, predictions, and drug targets.

The results of a preliminary work on an annotation scheme for the drug discovery have been published as a use case in this paper:

2. Software development. We have developed and successfully tested the software infrastructure to run QSAR and meta-QSAR experiments.

3. Software integration. We have integrated the workflow of our project into the OpenML platform (http://openml.org/). OpenML is a popular platform where datasets and predictions made by various machine learning algorithms are stored, shared and compared. This open approach to the sharing of machine learning experiments is designed to save time and efforts, as there is no need to repeat computational experiments. We have made an agreement with the OpenML Team that this platform will have a dedicated to drug discovery section. In this way the drug discovery research community will benefit from this already established platform and its functionality (i.e. the comparison of different predictions across different datsets).

We have adjusted our software to enable the deposition of our datasets and the results of machine learning runs directly to OpenML. We have worked together with the developers of OpenML platform and they implemented a secure access to the store datasets. 

Dr Sadawi and Prof. King (the University of Manchester) participated in OpenML Workshop, University of Technology Eindhoven in October, 2014 
By the end of the project all data and machine learning predictions will be available at OpenML. 

4. QSAR learning. We have done initial trails of QSAR and meta-QSAR learning. We are currently running the main QSAR learning experiments.



5. Dissemination. Intermediate project results have been presented by Dr Soldatova at the 20th Euro-QSAR conference in St Petersburg, Russia in September, 2014 as an oral communication &amp;quot;Meta QSAR&amp;quot; (http://www.ldorganisation.com/v2/produits.php?langue=english&amp;amp;cle_menus=1238915734).
