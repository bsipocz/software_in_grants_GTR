Partner 3 has built a collection of 200 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the standard laboratory isolate of C. elegans (N2 Bristol) and a genetically and phenotypically divergent isolate from Hawaii (CB4856). These lines show extensive variation in stress tolerance and lifespan (see description to WP3) and provide a fantastic resource for eQTL analysis. Partner 1 comprises PIs who have led the study of stress-adaptive phenotypes rather than just response phenotype, as well as those who have developed databases of gene/longevity relationships and gene pathway and network modelling approaches. Partners 2 and 4 have led the field in constructing and analyzing network models and Partner 5 has developed novel network design techniques for comparative analysis of networks. Our project will combine the expertise of these 5 partners to build, analyze and iteratively test predictive models for the networks that underlie stress tolerance and lifespan.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Systems biology aims to model quantitatively how complex systems work, the resulting model being refined by means of an iterative loop of experimental testing and further modelling.

Timeliness Our approach, of using the simplest animal system, of iterative experimentation and model building, and of directly linking eQTLs to phenotypic outcomes provides an unrivalled opportunity to dissect a naturally variant regulatory network. In contrast to work in mammals, it is the ease and speed of iterative experimental testing and validation that makes our project particularly powerful in advancing the model describing regulatory interactions. This approach is leveraged by the availability of cheap whole genome sequencing, advanced models for network analysis and construction, and rapid methods for directed perturbation and validation experiments. The time is now ripe for the application of this approach to a complex system such as stress and longevity regulation in C. elegans. Members of our consortium are international leaders in the construction and integration (Nature Genetics 40: 181-8), biological (Nature 431: 308-12, Nature Genetics 36: 492-6) and statistical (Phys Rev E 72: 011903, 78: 020901) analysis of networks. Combined with our expertise in the stress response (PNAS 101: 16970-5, 103: 2977-8), high-throughput (Nature Genetics 38: 896-903), and quantitative eQTL analysis (PLoS Genetics 2: e22, 3:e34), this places us in a unique position to undertake this project as an integrated team and to drive forward this area of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>210060</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We contributed to the consortium investigating the effect of natural variation in worm phenotypes.

Abstract
Background
Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) is the hidden genetic variation that can be unlocked by perturbing normal conditions. CGV can drive the emergence of novel complex phenotypes through changes in gene expression. Although our theoretical understanding of CGV has thoroughly increased over the past decade, insight into polymorphic gene expression regulation underlying CGV is scarce. Here we investigated the transcriptional architecture of CGV in response to rapid temperature changes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We analyzed gene expression regulatory variation (and mapped eQTL) across the course of a heat stress and recovery response in a recombinant inbred population.
Results 
We mapped eQTL over three temperature treatments: i) control, ii) heat stress, and iii) recovery from heat stress. Compared to control, exposure to heat stress affected the transcription of 3305 genes, whereas 942 were affected in recovering worms. These genes were mainly involved in metabolism and reproduction. The gene expression pattern in recovering worms resembled both the control and the heat stress treatment. Using the genetic variation of the recombinant inbred population, we found 2626 genes with an eQTL in the heat stress treatment, 1797 in the control, and 1880 in the recovery. The cis-eQTL were highly conserved across treatments. A considerable fraction of the trans-eQTL (40-57%) mapped to 19 treatment specific trans-bands. In contrast to cis-eQTL, trans-eQTL were highly environment specific and thus cryptic. Approximately 67% of the trans-eQTL were only induced in a single treatment, with heat-stress showing the most. 

Conclusions
These results illustrate the highly dynamic pattern of CGV across different environmental conditions that can be evoked by a stress response over a relatively short time-span (2 hours). Taken together our findings indicate that CGV is mainly determined by trans regulatory eQTL.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The identification of the QTLs can be used as a guide to investigating different phenotypes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7F205308-B885-4D0D-82D8-FF042DCF1DF2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deec920ab895.04302516</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36DAA4FC-B79A-4FD7-934C-26FA20C04DEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constraints and consequences of the emergence of amino acid repeats in eukaryotic proteins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature structural &amp; molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8dd37db244e210731eb1d000b670774"><gtr:id>c8dd37db244e210731eb1d000b670774</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chavali S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1545-9985</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a34f01d8dca96.04166107</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I004718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
