It employs a three-pronged approach to examine the use and understanding of social at different levels:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Strategic (Ministry of Defence)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Users (personal, operational and public including serving, ex-serving military personnel and their families)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Communications (social media texts).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Data will be gathered through qualitative methodologies (interviews, focus groups and observation work) to examine the motivations, intent and understanding of social media at the Strategic and User levels. To complement this, the communications approach will use social media analytics and textual analysis to identify the extent to which the above processes (in the user and strategic approach) are evident in social media texts including, for example, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Flicker, Pinteest and Blogs (official and non-official). Using this combined approach the project aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of how social media is perceived, understood and responded to as both a tool for strategic communication and a tool for uncertainty in defence practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The D.U.N project will impact onto policy, strategy, defence actors involved in strategic communication including those from the MoD and British Military, the wider public, media and education as well as the actors and communities we engage with through the research itself including charity organizations (such as veteran support groups), small, local, national and global industries related to this research, the public sector and wider cultural, media, political institutions. 

The impact strategy for the D.U.N Project is embedded into the research itself through each distinct approach but also in the combination of the three approaches (industry, content, users) that offers reflective critique, frameworks and comparisons. Consequently, the impact increases as the project develops. As each activity engages a specific community - MoD and British Military, social media communities and communities of users such as veterans and families, we aim to produce impact in the form of dialogue, discussions and ongoing consultation throughout the project. We understand impact in both tangible and intangible terms, so that as we report back to each community with our findings, we expect those discussions to spiral outwards, beyond the remit of the project, impacting more widely and meaningfully. The activities themselves will produce innovative responses to specific and needs, and lines of inquiry, directly benefitting the communities and cultures each activity works with. We work with the institutions in terms of the design of the project, and feed back into those institutions at various stages. 

We also have a range of targeted outputs that aim to impact into specific areas. The conference at Cranfield aims to directly engage the military and MoD to whom we speak, whilst the academic conference targets key research interests, and a broader academic sweep. The written outputs offer depth of approach a cross a breadth of topics, while the academic retreat is designed to utilise and engage specific expertise in a targeted way. These events are underpinned by a virtual presence that will consolidate and disseminate the findings, grow and develop an interested community from an informed position, develop agendas and share expertise. This multi-tiered approach is both targeted and broad, and, along with the design of the project as a whole, will facilitate rapid responses to policy reports, think tanks, and specific actor, industry and community needs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242158</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with the Business Advisor for Digital Engagement, National Policing Vision</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B9BB0C41-616B-4A5B-A3D1-2D1B954C1AF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The intention of the meeting was to assess the relevance and resonance of the DUN Project findings to the work of National Policing Vision and to assess if there was scope to integrate some of the findings into the working practices of National Policing Vision</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5899a3c089e155.86592672</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Dean of Academic Studies at Defence Studies Department, Joint Services Staff College, Schrivenham</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D1103A3-C547-4050-937A-D229B0F49F78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with Dean of Academic Studies &amp;amp; Head of Department and other members of Defence Studies Department to discuss the presentation and possible embedding of DUN Project findings into Defence Studies curriculum.

The aim of the work workshop was used to:
1. Facilitate open discussion regarding the key findings of the DUN project assess initial impact opportunities for stakeholders 
2. To discuss future directions for Impact activity, including wider dissemination activities and further research 
3. To consider potential policy recommendations.

Initial Impact: 

Awareness, Understanding, Attitude: Comments made by participants indicated the key findings of the project challenged their current thinking around the risks and opportunities of social media, thereby raising their awareness of potential problems in current practices across the Defence community (National, Organisational and Community level).

Behaviour, Practice, Performance: There was suggestion that this increased awareness may lead to changes in practice, behaviour and performance in digital communications work in the Armed Forces. 

Opportunity: It was apparent that participants benefitted from the facilitation of a forum in which they could communally discuss their work and engage in the exchange information and ideas. 

Future IMPACT and Dissemination Directions 

All participants highlighted the importance of the evidence-based solutions arising from the DUN Project indicating the need for further dissemination to other key stakeholders including: 
1. those responsible for social media training and education in the Armed Forces
2. Senior personnel involved in the strategic direction of defence communications. 

These suggestions will be followed up as part of on-going DUN Project Impact Activities</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb6e3658fe55.29741462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC News Interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0F1D0377-D366-4F40-B5C1-6178040D2269</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sarah Maltby was interviewed by the BBC Television News Channel about the announcement of the launch of the British Military's 77th Brigade set up to influence conflicts through media and social media information</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb6f1159e269.64631251</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with 77 Brigade, British Army, Denison Barracks, Hermitage</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6AE5DB3B-DD7E-429A-84EF-700149F2D6BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop was designed to introduce 77th Brigade to the DUN Project findings and assess the relevance for the work of 77 Brigade, particularly in terms of their engagement with Influencing Activities and the means through which they measure the effectiveness of their campaigns. 77 Brigade is a combined Regular Army and Army Reserve unit organised to use information based and engagement activities to adapt behaviours of opposing forces and adversaries.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5899a32bb7fd72.47895569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC World News Interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0189CBFF-B807-4BDC-8931-5FDF9BA77516</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sarah Maltby was interviewed by BBC World Television News Channel about the announcement of the launch of the British Military's 77th Brigade set up to influence conflicts through media and social media information</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb6f449cfaf8.33877429</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Impact Meeting with Member of Directorate of Defence Communications (MOD)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3B3F7A4-7B9A-47B8-8355-7E5443401943</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the meeting was to: 
1. Facilitate open discussion regarding the key findings of the DUN project and assess impact opportunities for Defence stakeholders, particularly within the Ministry of Defence but also beyond 
2. To discuss future directions for Impact activity, including wider dissemination activities and further research 
3. To consider potential policy recommendations.

Initial Impact: 

Awareness, Understanding, Attitude: The key findings clearly challenged the current thinking of the participant, specifically around the evaluation and insight practices at the Directorate of Defence Communications (DDC), but also around cultures of risk aversion within the Defence community (National, Organisational and Community level) as they relate to social media monitoring and practice. 

Future IMPACT and Dissemination Directions 
As with other impact activities, the participant highlighted the importance of the evidence-based solutions arising from the DUN Project and identified specific areas where impact could (and should) be achieved: 
1. those responsible for training and education including across those responsible for social media training and briefing delivery in Armed Forces but also at the Defence Academy and those responsible for professional development in the Armed Forces. 
2. members of DDC and those responsible for social media strategies (monitoring, evaluation, insight etc) 
3. Further research into the social media practices of Armed Forces families in light of the new accommodation model arising from the Strategic Defence Review

These suggestions are being pursued through on-going DUN Project Impact Activities</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>579f4be8995894.94971240</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings are being disseminated via policy briefings, workshops and meetings within the Defence Sector but also beyond. 

The findings are contributing to changes in the working practices of the Directorate of Defence Communications at the Ministry of Defence, and in the on-going development of training of UK Armed Forces personnel. The DUN Project continue to work with key stakeholders in this regard as part of our on-going Impact Activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3CA6BC20-DA8D-4DE0-B756-A1F4A8257F73</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fba0c825390.52063346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objective of the DUN Project was to interrogate the ways in which social media is perceived, organized, managed and responded to within the British defence community in order to better identify, assess and understand how risk can be managed. Our three key findings below (and associated recommendations) are notable in their relevance beyond the Defence work in that they indicate how and why digital technologies intersect with everyday organisations in various ways with particular consequences. 

Key Finding 1: Social Media is understood in narrow terms within the Defence Sector which, in turn, affects how the risks and opportunities of social media are understood and managed. With regards to the opportunites of social media, these understandings a) generate recourse to potentially ineffectual traditional media management techniques because social media is understood as content (i.e. text and images) rather than a complex digital architecture of multiple interconnected meta-data and platforms; b) assume that social media content and the outcomes of content can be evaluated accurately, objectively, and also independently of the external agencies who control and own the platforms and data (Google, Facebook etc). With regard to risk these understandings a) wrongly assume a lack of knowledge, expertise and risk management among members of the Armed Forces including family members; b) misunderstand the digital environment as content rather than a complex data-logical system where individuals do not have ownership of their own social media (meta)data, or the ability to intervene in its dissemination and appropriation.; c) generate broad education and awareness campaigns that do not cohere with or capitalise on the knowledge, expertise and management strategies that many Armed Forces personnel employ as everyday, mundane consumers of social and digital media. 

Key Finding 2: There is a culture of risk aversion within Defence Sector that perpetuates a fear of the digital, distorts the realities of social media risks and undermines effective risk management. In particular, social and digital media is not adequately integrated into the working and social practices of the Armed Forces despite the centrality of social media to the everyday lives of personnel, and is instead 'demonised' (for example poor Wi-fi provision and disapproval of mobile phone use). This culture of risk aversion: a) significantly undermines opportunities to develop digital knowledge, expertise and management within the wider Armed Forces community; b) encourages clandestine, rather than responsible social media use.

Key Finding 3: Defence organisational and management structures lack direction and coherence in the planning, implementation and monitoring of social media. The digital environment is diffuse, rapidly evolving and a uniquely individual experience in terms of how, when, what and why users engage with it. In contrast, the organisational and management structures of defence evolve slowly and prioritise the collective experience through centralised, top-down hierarchical, multi-layered units (brigades, regiments, services etc). Consequently, the management of social media within defence does not easily map onto individual social media use practically and culturally. Responsibility for the planning, implementation and monitoring of social media in defence remains unclear, as do the processes by which training and briefings are designed and delivered. Overall, there is a lack of consistent and coherent direction in the management of the digital at both a strategic and everyday level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Specifically within the Defence Sector we have recommended that the DUN Project findings highlight the need for the following but each of these recommendations has resonance with all large public sector and security organisations. Similarly, the practice and cultures of large organisations that are exposed through these findings offer a wider contribution to our understanding of the digital world as part of organisational and community life. 

Recommendations:
1. the re-assessment of social media insight and evaluation practices to achieve more realistic evaluation of content and content outcomes in promotional campaign work. In particular, to take account of a) the wider architecture of the digital environment beyond social media 'content'; b) the difficulties of accurately, objectively and independently evaluating content, and content outcomes in a meaningful manner; c) the relevance and utility of metric based assessments of social media content that may be skewed or misrepresent. 

2. the re-design of social media education and awareness campaigns that pay due heed to existing expertise and knowledge within the organisation (particularly among younger social media users), and the wider frameworks in which social media users operate and understand the risks and opportunities of social media differently as consumers of digital media (as oppose to in an organisational or professional capacity). 

3. to consider the social media practices of those on the periphery of, but also central to, large organisations - in this case the families and partners of members of the Armed Forces - to ensure they are offered adequate training and support with regards to the impact of their social media use at an organisational and community level.
