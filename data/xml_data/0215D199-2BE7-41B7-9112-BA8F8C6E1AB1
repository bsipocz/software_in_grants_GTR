While a number of studies have analysed the expression of retrotransposons at a global level there is very limited information relating to the regulation of individual elements. Therefore, we are currently using the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a model system to analyze the regulation of individual retrotransposable elements. Our preliminary studies indicate that the basal expression of Tf2 retrotransposable elements is dependent upon their chromosomal context. Furthermore, the expression of at least a subset of these elements is repressed by the HIR/Asf1 nucleosome assembly factors and histone deacetylases suggesting that chromatin plays a key role in the regulation of these elements. Therefore, major objectives of this study are to dissect the regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of individual Tf2 elements and to characterise the chromatin structures that are associated with these elements. Further objectives are to determine whether disruption of chromatin leads to the mobilization of Tf2 retrotransposons and because retrotransposable elements are potential sources of genomic instability, to determine the role that chromatin plays in suppressing ectopic recombination between Tf2 elements.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>287394</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements which are found in the genomes of all eukaryotic organisms including humans.

Our work revealed that the histone chaperone complex, HIRA plays a key role in the transcriptional silencing of Tf2/gypsy class LTR retrotransposons and their remnants in fission yeast.

2. An assay to measure the frequency of endogenous Tf2 mobilization events was established and the HIRA complex was found to restrict the spread of these elements in cells exposed to the stress imposed by low oxygen concentrations.

3 Tf2 elements were found not to function as intermolecular recombination hotspots either in wild type cells or in cells lacking the function of the HIRA complex. Thus it is unlikely that these elements are a major source of genomic instability.

LTR retrotransposons are present in the genomes of most eukaryotes (including those of mammals) and the HIRA histone chaperone is evolutionarily conserved. Thus our results have broad implications for the role of HIRA in control of LTR retrotransposons in other eukaryotic organisms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Enhance understanding of the regulation of retrotransposons and retroviruses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F370E224-A008-4F5A-B12A-E7A1066BCE01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460de5d3b4ec6.28409620</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Creation of fission yeast strain that allows the mobilization frequency of endogenous LTR retrotransposon to measured</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A5CC60B-0EE8-4962-9B9C-0ED8953AA073</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460e4527229e8.81802346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LTR retrotransposition assay</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34C04E45-A405-45AA-B02C-D8BC44DE5B08</gtr:id><gtr:title>The fission yeast HIRA histone chaperone is required for promoter silencing and the suppression of cryptic antisense transcripts.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and cellular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/984e460e0199e59dcac57ab8d94077de"><gtr:id>984e460e0199e59dcac57ab8d94077de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anderson HE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0270-7306</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5460e86e2d5cd1.45495401</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3617AE8-8A4D-479D-B586-FE6753B264C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Silencing mediated by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIRA complex is dependent upon the Hpc2-like protein, Hip4.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/984e460e0199e59dcac57ab8d94077de"><gtr:id>984e460e0199e59dcac57ab8d94077de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anderson HE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5460e1ce2b48b6.98985544</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E014445/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
