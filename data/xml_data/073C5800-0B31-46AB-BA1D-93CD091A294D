MediaLive is a collaborative project between academics from the University of Leeds' School of Performance and Cultural Industries (PCI) and members of the Learning team at the National Media Museum (NMeM), based in Bradford. NMeM is part of the National Museum of Science and Industry (NMSI), including the Science Museum and the National Railway Museum. The project will draw upon Leeds academics' expertise in i) museum interpretation and performance, ii) the theoretical practices of performer training iii) use of new technologies in interactive environments. Museum education specialisms and media expertise will be provided by the partner organization, NMeM. The PhD project is directly aligned with the development and implementation of a new live interpretation programme at the museum, one of the Museum's key strategic aims over the next five years and consonant with its mission statement: 'helping audiences explore the artistic, technological, social and cultural impact of media and understanding how different media reflect and shape our lives and world in which we live'. The following broad set of objectives underpin the range of potential research projects envisaged by the project partners, dependent on the specific research interests and skills of the nominated student:\n\n*To explore methods of live interpretation specific to the media collections held by the museum which are of national importance \n*To develop a sustainable performed interpretation programme for the future mapped closely onto the Museum's strategic plan\n*To integrate training and support into the interpretation strategy\n*To develop up to three new live interpretation examples\n*To ensure animation, film and/or other recorded media as appropriate are included in the live offer\n*To inform the future development of a museum portfolio of live events through practice based development, analysis and reflection. \n\nThe immediate impact will be on NMeM Explainers, managers and audiences, and as a practice-led project the latter could easily be in excess of half a million people over 3 years. NMSI museums, already with their own targeted training for Explainers, serve to gain too from the knowledge generated around the particular issues of media interpretation. There are several unique and newly acquired resources housed in the NMeM, some of which have not been fully exploited or interpreted. A new video-games archive and the Ray Harryhausen archive are two examples expected to widen the impact further, through new audiences. This research will be of benefit to both partners in terms of developing the Museum's research activity and providing the University with an opportunity to engage with a national museum with unique collections. The perceived benefits of this collaboration for the academic partner can be summarised thus:\n*Opportunity to develop further a profile of practice-based doctoral research with a public facing outcome.\n*Expansion of a working relationship with NMeM into a designated research project with scope for PCI staff to collaborate in the future.\n*Further consolidation of CDA awards success and development of a collaborative PhD community of experts.\n*Enhancement and diversification of current research activity in Museum performance.\n\nThe perceived benefits for the industry partner can be summarised thus:\n*Expansion of the Museum's mission into dedicated Live Interpretation for media.\n*Development of a sustainable live interpretation programme founded on detailed academic research and testing.\n*Raising of the profile of NMSI as an organization with strong academic interests.\n\nThe research will be applied directly in the development of a live interpretation strategy for the museum and for NMSI more widely, and will impact on</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As a CDA proposal the impact anticipated for the MediaLive project centres on the collaborative partner and ripples out from there. Partnerships with three National museums are inherent in the project design. The National Media Museum has 600,000 visitors per year. Its sister museums, Science Museum and National Railway Museum have visitor numbers in line with their relative size (3,000,000 and 700,000 respectively). As a project which focuses principally on the development of a bespoke Live interpretation strategy for the Media Museum, the immediate impact will be on NMeM Explainers, managers and audiences, and as this is a practice-led project a not unrealistic estimate of the latter could easily be in excess of half a million people over the course of the project. The wider NMSI museums, already with their own targeted training for Explainers, serve to gain too from the knowledge generated around the particular issues of media interpretation. There are several unique resources, including new acquisitions, housed in the NMeM, some of which have not been fully exploited or interpreted. A new video-games archive and the Ray Harryhausen archive are two examples of new collections which could form an important resource for the project and widen the impact further, through new audiences. \n\nBeyond the NMSI there is a growing knowledge-base of Museum performance training within the Yorkshire region (e.g. Armouries Museum, National Coal Mining Museum England) and beyond (Triangle Theatre in Coventry as one instance) working on cognate areas of interpretation who would benefit from the findings of this project, and from the specific issues raised by multi-media collections and performance interpretation.\n\nDigitally enhanced and media-literate interpretation techniques are set to be one of the key interpretation developments in the next decade and are already being linked in the industry with strategies of sustainability in straitened times (for instance, the forthcoming MCG conference in November 2010 at the Museum of London: DOING MORE WITH LESS: rising to the digital challenge in difficult times). In such a context, this research could be genuinely influential for the museum industry in the UK as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02318X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
