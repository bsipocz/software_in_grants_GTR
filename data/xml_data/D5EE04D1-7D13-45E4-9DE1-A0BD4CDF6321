This will be achieved by examining the evolving relationship between stress, anxiety and depression (ie poor psychological adjustment) over the natural course of the disorder. The project involves three main assessment phases over one-year and a detailed investigation of a sub-sample. Consenting participants with acute insomnia and an equivalent number of normal sleepers will complete a series of questionnaires about their personality, their levels of psychological adjustment, and their sleep. These answers will be compared to build a profile of what discriminates acute insomniacs from normal sleepers and provide an insight into how the disorder is initiated and maintained. A random selection from each group will also attend the Sleep Laboratory for an assessment of their actual sleep, their sleep genes, and the timing of their body clock. These findings will inform the public of practical strategies when faced with an initial sleep disruption and help health-care practitioners prevent an acute period of sleep disruption from becoming a chronic illness.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183161</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cape Town</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Supervision team for a PhD student :PhD thesis : understanding the devlopment of insomnia subtypes</gtr:description><gtr:id>465DF808-DC25-4BC2-B1BD-83E723D541A8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b957fdb4b957fdc8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>I have been asked to join the supervision team for a PhD student (Michelle Baker) at the University of Capetown.

Initially, we identified that there is no existing evidence on the treatment of acute insomnia and conveyed this to clinicians through the policy document (Update on Mental Health in Scotland: A guide to delivering evidence-based psychological therapies in Scotland). One of the cornerstones of our public engagement talks has been outlining the findings that a significant proportion of individuals with acute insomnia will naturally remit (especially if it is their first episode) as opposed to transit to chronic insomnia and that there are cognitive and behavioural interventions that appear to be beneficial in buffering against the transition to chronic insomnia. As such we have outlined the need to explore non-pharmacological self-help interventions to over 1,700 member of the public. Feedback from our professional engagement talks (particularly the CFS/ME Northern Clinical Network, the UCB Talk, and the talk at the Freeman Hospital) suggests that changes in how sleep is assessed and what advice is given have been instigated in at least three clinical services in the North of England that we know of. The success of the extension to the existing clinical service at the Royal Victoria Infirmary which aims to address acute insomnia and complex cases is also directly impactful to individuals with insomnia. Although the numbers seen through the service at present are small due to the allotted time (.5 days per week), we have seen significant improvements in terms of the quality of life and a reductions in calls from patients for a prescription for hypnotics. More broadly, we have been informed that the talks to the A Level teachers (National Science Learning Centre) have resulted in sleep being chosen as one of the option choices for the A Level curriculum at three colleges/schools.
Findings and Outputs
The study findings have been translated into a comprehensive message: the three-Ds (Detect, Distract, Detach). The first D (Detect) works on the premise of our finding that early identification buffers affect against the transition from acute to chronic insomnia and high levels of sleep-related dysfunctional beliefs positively related to the transition from acute to chronic insomnia. As such we suggest an individual identify and acknowledge their sleep problem but reframe it within the context of a 'normal' biological reaction to stress. The second D (Distract) works on the premise that daytime sleep preoccupations and sleep-related effort at night also predict the transition to chronic insomnia. As such we suggest the individual uses cognitive techniques (i.e. a series of distraction techniques similar to those used in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia) during the acute phase. The third, and final, D (Detach) relates to two of our findings a) that those people who reduced the amount of time spent in bed, during the acute phase, were more likely to remit from acute insomnia compared to those who kept their normal routines or increased their Time in Bed, and b) that 'nesting behaviour' (i.e. using the bedroom for activities unrelated to sleep or sex such as watching TV or catching up on e-mail) mediated the relationship between stress and the length of the insomnia. As such we advocate the 15-minute rule (i.e. if you are in bed for more than 15 minutes, not asleep, get out of the bedroom) and remove all non-sleep-related items from the bedroom. This framework has been the basis for the GP leaflet and has also been outlined at all public and professional engagement events. Additionally, as the Newcastle Science Festival and TEDx talks were filmed both will be available for download soon on a dedicated webpage for the Northumbria Centre for Sleep Research and on our Facebook page (the TEDx talk will also be available on their main website and on Youtube).

How these impacts were achieved
These impacts have been achieved through four public engagement events (From Bench to Bedside: Recent advances in preventative sleep medicine. Newcastle Science Festival (Newcastle, UK); Synchronising your secret sleep switch. Newcastle Science Festival: Newcastle, UK; I can't sleep! Understanding the psychology of insomnia. British Science Festival: Surrey, UK; Sleep Medicine in the 21st Century. TEDx Conference: Stockport, UK), three professional engagement talks (The significance and consequence of insomnia. Taipei, Taiwan: Sponsored by Sanofi Aventis; What's new in insomnia research? York, UK: Sponsored by UCB Pharma; Understanding CBT-I in CFS/ME. Northumberland, UK: Sponsored by NHS Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and ME Northern Clinical Network), one talk to a local sleep service (Understanding insomnia: acute to chronic and beyond. Freeman Hospital: Newcastle), and one consultation document (Update on Mental Health in Scotland: A guide to delivering evidence-based psychological therapies in Scotland 'The Matrix: Subsection: Insomnia; National Education for Scotland). Additionally, we recently extended a local clinical service for people with insomnia, the 'Sleep Well Clinic', at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, to provide an evidence-based service for people with acute insomnia and complex cases and the PI runs that particular side of the service under an Honorary Contract. We have also produced the second iteration of our GP leaflet 'Stressed and Sleeplesswhat to do now!' following our proposed focus groups with GPs and service users. 
Whom
These findings continue to have a significant impact on clinicians, both sleep specialists and non-specialists, from a number of perspectives and approaches (physical and psychological) and across a number of illnesses and conditions (psychiatry, respiratory medicine, ENT, CFS/ME). As the purpose of the National Health Service Education for Scotland 'Matrix' was to provide service developers and commissioners, health-care practitioners, and trainees a guide to delivering evidence-based services psychological across Scotland the inclusion of the insomnia section has the potential to significantly impact at all delivery levels. That said, this is limited by the fact that the only aspect that was reported about acute insomnia was that there was no evidence base. As the programme of work was addressing an issue related to both primary prevention and tertiary care the beneficiaries also include the lay public and those in primary care.

Unexpected Impacts
There have been three unexpected impacts based on this programme of work. Firstly, we found a high prevalence on individuals who reported having insomnia, did not meet criteria for insomnia, but instead met criteria for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). To that end we have obtained funding (UCB Pharma, &amp;pound;48k) to further explore this concept of 'masked Restless legs Syndrome' (mRLS) and create an algorithm for scientists, practitioners, and the public to help differentiate insomnia from RLS to determine the best care pathway. This has also resulted in the PI being appointed as an Expert Scientific Advisor Panel Member for UCB Pharma and a systematic review of the literature (in progress). The second unexpected impact came in two forms; firstly from an invited workshop to the CFS/ME Northern Clinical Network about acute insomnia and secondly from a radio interview / phone-in about the findings of the research with the PI. In both cases members of the audience (clinicians and a parent) asked for guidance on what can be done for sleep problems in children with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME. This stimulated a literature search, and based on the paucity of evidence, the creation of a working group of clinicians, parents, and researchers, led by the PI, to bid for and obtain funding (Action for ME, &amp;pound;11k) for a study to explore the role of sleep, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The final unexpected impact has developed from the finding that the main polysomnographic predictors of the transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia (namely reduced latency to Rapid Eye Movement sleep and reduced Slow Wave Sleep) are also observed during the five weeks prior to and during an episode of Major Depression. We have written this finding up for publication and will be submitting the manuscript within the next month to Archives of General Psychiatry.
Future Impacts
We currently have four manuscripts in progress (Does personality influence the experience of insomnia?; Precipitating factors in insomnia: an update and extension of Bastien et al; Differences in psychological adjustment between normal sleepers and people with acute insomnia; The role of psychological adjustment in the natural evolution of insomnia) and several others planned. Additionally, the PI will be filming and hosting a two-part BBC One documentary 'Goodnight Britain' (May 2012 - June 2012) on the identification, assessment, and treatment of sleep disorders (including discussing the three D's for insomnia) in the community, which will be aired in the autumn of 2012. Additionally, at present we have still not analysed the sleep diary data from the longitudinal survey (n = 21,000 diary nights of data). As such we expect this will also deliver additional findings and associated impact. Our GP/Public leaflet is in its second iteration after piloting it with a series of service users and health-care professionals in the North East of the UK. We aim to have this in production and distributed nationally by the end of the year. To this end we will be tracking the uptake of the leaflet to determine impact levels for the leaflet as well as the number of hits to the websites for the public engagement films. Additionally, as we have engaged a great deal with the scientific community, clinicians and other health-care practitioners, and with the public at local, regional, and national levels, this has been concentrated more recently. As such, we will not be able to determine the full extent and influence of our impact activities for some time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>12CFA1D8-E1D0-42F9-9D21-00BF9E84AB5A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463bd4114a907.80652576</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Based upon the findings from the studies we have:

1) Created a standard diagnostic measure to identify people with acute insomnia in both the community and in primary care
2) Demonstrated the prevalence of acute insomnia in the UK population (7.9%) and in the USA (9.5%)
3) Shown that around a third (between 31.2% and 36.6% depending on how we define acute insomnia) of the UK population will suffer from acute insomnia in one year
4) Demonstrated that over a fifth (21.43%) of those people with acute insomnia will transition to chronic insomnia 
5) Shown that significant night-to-night variability exists in the objective sleep of people with acute insomnia compared to those who sleep normally
6) Demonstrated that if your acute insomnia does not remit within three months you are significantly more at risk of developing your first-ever episode of depression (9.26% move likely) compared to if you were a normal sleeper (1.85%) or remitted from acute insomnia within three months (1.85%)
7) Shown that specific characteristics of sleep are altered in people with acute insomnia (they demonstrate much longer periods of light sleep) compared to normal sleepers
8) That people who are likely to transit to chronic insomnia, as opposed to remit, demonstrate a sleep profile (i.e. a shorter than normal onset of REM sleep and reduced amounts of deep sleep) which is also a biological marker of the development of many other psychiatric illnesses (including depression and anxiety disorders)
9) Shown that the main characteristics that predict who will develop chronic insomnia, as opposed to remitting, are increased worry, more preoccupation about sleep, having unrealistic expectations of sleep and using alcohol to sleep or caffeine to keep awake during the day</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From the findings of the studies we have developed a self-help toolkit which comprises of an information leaflet and narrative which aims to circumvent the transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia. We have piloted the toolkit and found that it prevents the transition to chronic insomnia in approximately 60% of cases compared to 15%, in a group who did not receive the toolkit. We are now exploring:
a) how feasible the toolkit would be to use in primary care
b) the impact of the toolkit on levels of psychological adjustment (i.e. stress, anxiety and depression)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>95D3BE71-E432-478C-BA88-6B1DA0100ECE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463bd0c853fc3.73582795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Mental Health in Scotland: A guide to delivering evidence-based psychological therapies in Scotland 'The Matrix: Subsection: Insomnia' (National Education for Scotland)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6A87FB3A-8D23-4EB4-9798-933A3BA4E915</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first document to provide details for the stepped care management of mental health issues based upon evidence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546384990b33d9.84078370</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>A brief behavioural intervention based upon the principles of CBT.
