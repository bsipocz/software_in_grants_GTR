It is well accepted that flow within the weld pool significantly influences weld region shape, microstructure, defect and resulting residual stress formation during solidification. However, there are no reliable experimental data on flow within metallic alloy weld pools and scientific understanding is reliant on simplified models and simulations that lack proper validation. Hence, the objective of this proposal is to acquire 3D visualisation in real time (i.e. 4D) quantification of the liquid metal flow to analyse evolving flow in weld pools. The results will guide, validate and qualify weld pool modelling and the scientific understanding will enable improvements in the weld processes. 

A unique and novel experimental configuration is proposed to realise time-resolved stereo X-ray imaging for in situ weld simulation experiments at the Diamond Light Source, UK. An experimental configuration, with two mutually inclined X-ray beams, which are obtained through splitting the regular synchrotron beam using X-ray optics, will be instrumental in realising the stereo imaging capability. Small, high X-ray attenuating particles embedded in the weld materials (in weld pool) will serve as markers to track the evolving fluid flow patterns. Combining the two sets of time-resolved images recorded in this stereo configuration, via bespoke image processing and analysing procedures will render 4D visualisation and spatio-temporal quantification of flow, enabling analysis of flow in evolving weld pools.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Welding is a significantly important industrial process essential for the assembly of components for a wide range of applications. Such applications range from automotive structures, which are produced in mass quantities, to a custom made gigantic offshore oil platform sitting in the cold North Sea, or even an extremely safety critical nuclear power plant assembly. 

This proposal aims to deliver long term impacts and contributions to welding applications across different industrial sectors in order to improve safety, life time, optimum resource utilisation and economic competitiveness through enhancing our fundamental understanding. The pathways to these long term impacts will emerge from realising short to medium term academic impact through a step-change enhancement in primary insight of melt pool behaviour during welding processes, as well as establishment of a novel, high tech experimental method, which is capable of delivering extended investigations and analysis of the phenomena.
 
Visualisation of how flow patterns take place in a real weld pool 3 dimensionally in real-time will stun the welding research community, giving access to realistic information beyond that any existing experimental method or modelling capability has delivered to date. These quantified results provide novel time resolved 3D benchmark data to compare with different weld pool modelling for validation, improvement, development or guidance. This will enable engineering of the weld pool flow to be favourable for applications, for example developing appropriate novel filler materials. The analysis of quantified data in relation to different weld conditions will greatly develop detailed scientific understanding in this field. 

The two most important outreach targets are academic researchers, and researchers and engineers from the relevant industries. Findings will not only be published in peer reviewed journals and presented at international meetings; in addition they will also be conveyed directly to the beneficiaries of the research through collaborations, facilitated through academic-industry-research council joint establishments such as doctoral training centres, networking and public engagement activities. The project end workshop will serve as a key opportunity to disseminate project development to the immediate and wider research community. 

Further, progress and the research outcomes will be communicated to the general public by building on the media liaison capabilities of the University and the Diamond Light Source, with public open days being another regular opportunity for communication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100547</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P02680X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
