This is partly because psychological theories of substance use disorders (addictions) rely on a simplistic conceptualization of 'inhibitory control', defined as the ability to stop, change or delay inappropriate behaviour. These theories are founded on the assumption that behaviour is controlled by an unspecified 'inhibitory homunculus' or central control system, and that impairments to the functioning of this homunculus result in addiction. There is good reason to believe that this assumption is incorrect. In this project I aim to apply predictions from a recent theoretical framework of inhibitory control to the study of inhibitory deficits in heavy drinkers. Specifically, I will break down the inhibitory 'homunculus' into its component processes in order to more precisely specify the nature of inhibitory deficits in alcohol use disorders. In an initial study, I will investigate the extent to which different inhibitory sub-processes are influenced by alcohol-related cues in a naturalistic 'bar lab', and measure the association between these inhibitory sub-processes and individual differences in drinking behaviour. In a second study I will use ecological momentary assessment to investigate the effect of situational variables (including alcohol cues) on inhibitory sub-processes in participants' natural environments, and I will investigate which inhibitory sub-processes are associated with increased alcohol consumption. Finally, a third study will investigate whether alcohol-cues can be paired with the engagement of inhibitory control, and if this 'inhibitory control training' (ICT) can prompt a reduction in alcohol consumption that survives a change in context. The results from these studies will form the basis of a new theoretical understanding of inhibitory control in addiction. Findings will also impact the future development of behavioral treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Aside from academics studying addiction and inhibition, this research will also benefit a wide range of stakeholders due to its interdisciplinary and translational nature. 

The use of portable devices to collect key variables in substance use disorders is novel and will potentially have an impact outside of academia, for healthcare professionals and public health experts in the long term. For example, the identification and measurement of transient variables, which play a causal role in substance use in real time, may have implications for relapse prevention. Over a longer time period, our research will also have an impact on the development of behavioral interventions for substance use disorders. Through improving our understanding of behaviors that underlie heavy drinking, and targeting those behaviours with therapeutic interventions, the research will have a positive impact on both healthcare providers as well as patients. Successful development of computerized interventions which can be delivered on portable devices can significantly reduce healthcare costs, whilst opening up treatments that can overcome barriers such as geographical location and visits to healthcare settings. The majority of adults in the UK own smartphone or tablet devices, therefore I anticipate that there will be economic benefits attributable to this research in the long term. For this reason, I will specifically target healthcare and public health professionals, as well as the general public, when I come to disseminate the research. For example, my team will attend the North West Alcohol Conference to present research and discuss with leading healthcare professionals and the public. I will also use mentor Field's links within the UKCTAS and the Alcohol Health Alliance to engage with prominent public health figures such as Sir Ian Gilmore. 

The findings of study two will also likely lead to increased collaborations between research groups / healthcare professionals and industrial partners, through the development of apps designed to measure behaviours, which are difficult to model in laboratory settings. 

The novel approaches I use and the focus on heavy drinking means that my research will also be of interest to the general public. I have a number of planned activities designed to engage with the public on the topic of heavy drinking, including attendance at science festivals, and a public debate held at the University of Liverpool. The discussion of heavy drinking, its underlying psychology and societal impact will increase public awareness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>134827</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B083E14D-6D28-4A56-A856-4608A1972011</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cognitive training as a potential treatment for overweight and obesity: A critical review of the evidence.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Appetite</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d76303f19265c282fc765d04ce2d33ed"><gtr:id>d76303f19265c282fc765d04ce2d33ed</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0195-6663</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a79ee49ce6b50.78983913</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N016211/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
