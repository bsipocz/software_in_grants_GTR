This together forms the basis of long-term sustainability through the newly established legal entity EuroFIR AISBL). Six Work Packages are included: Quality standards &amp;amp; certification; Systems integration &amp;amp; operational support; Integration &amp;amp; business development; Training; Dissemination &amp;amp; Management. The revised consortium has 35 existing EuroFIR partners (18 as 3rd parties/EuroFIR AISBL members). The already achieved high-level institutional commitment will be further strengthened. The new General Assembly consists of executive representatives of all beneficiaries (who are also AISBL Members), thus real and durable integration is achievable. The Executive Board will work closely with EuroFIR AISBL to provide an integrated approach to joint activities and stakeholder engagements. A high-level External Advisory Board of key users/stakeholders from Europe and internationally will ensure that food data, other products and services are fine-tuned to stakeholders needs, keeping Europe at the forefront of leadership and innovation in this area. Outputs are consistent with the ETP `Food for Life? and will further support Theme 2 (FP7) in food and nutrition research contributing to the structuring of leadership and innovation in this area. Outputs are consistent with the ETP `Food for Life? and will further support Theme 2 (FP7) in food and nutrition research contributing to the structuring of the European Research Area and world-class scientific/technological excellence. Additionally, the outputs bring the EFP in alignment with the current European CEN Standard on Food Data and its application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The consortium had 35 members, including 18 third-party organisations linked through EuroFIR AISBL. This assures continued high-level institutional commitment. The General Assembly represents all beneficiaries, promoting real and durable integration, whilst the Executive Board worked closely with EuroFIR AISBL to deliver an integrated approach for common research activities and stakeholder engagement. An External Advisory Board, comprising key users and stakeholders globally, ensures that food data, and EuroFIR AISBL products and services, are tailored to user and stakeholder needs, keeping Europe at the forefront of leadership and innovation.

Key strategic objectives include:
A coherent quality framework for, and technical approach in, food data collection, storage, sharing and publication, and increased visibility and implementation of CEN standards for food composition data and its application;
Food information tools and repositories available via the EuroFIR AISBL portal to facilitate exchange of standardised food information, including composition data, which will empower food information users globally and improve data quality, and thus also the relevance and value of their products and services;
Sustained high-level institutional commitment to real and durable integration, expansion of the compiler network to include non-EuroFIR AISBL countries, within and beyond Europe, participation of other users and stakeholders, and robust future income streams from a wide range of sources;
Spreading of excellence, including training and skills development, and access to world-class facilities, which will enhance the impact of EuroFIR AISBL globally in the development, management and exploitation of food composition data and new research tools for public health nutrition research;
Successful dissemination and communication, and stakeholder engagement, leading to knowledge and technology transfer of targeted resources within the scientific community, and to regulators, policy-makers and the food and beverage industries, as well as the general public, to maximise the impact of European food, diet and health research.
The general objective was to further integrate/refine the EuroFIR Food Platform (EFP), to improve/support the ways research is undertaken into relationships between food, diets and health in Europe. The focus was on extending application and exploitation of validated food data and tools for pan-European nutrition studies and networked usage, implementation of standards and best practice.
