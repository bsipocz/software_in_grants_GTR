trial</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G1001784</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The global health burden associated with HIV continues to grow with 33 million people estimated to be living with HIV in 2009 and 2.7 million new infections. In absence of a cure, an effective vaccine would be the most sustainable way to prevent new HIV infections. We propose to make the most of what we have learned from a series of previous vaccine trials to design and test an HIV vaccine strategy which we believe will trigger a better immune response than those observed so far and potentially lead to the identification of a successful vaccine and vaccine strategy.

The proposal brings together the scientific expertise and a range of vaccine products that are designed around a common HIV virus found predominantly in Southern and East Africa, India and Nepal and which has caused the world s worst HIV epidemics and is responsible for around half of all infections. The study will be conducted in collaboration with the UK HIV Vaccines Consortium (UK HVC) whose mission is to generate a series of candidate vaccines containing similar HIV antigens, such that direct comparison can be achieved to understand most rapidly the most immunogenic strategy for immunization in man.

The design of the UK HVC 001DMP trial is based on an immunisation regimen similar to that used in the only HIV vaccine trial to demonstrate partial efficacy (RV144, which showed a 31% reduction in HIV infection in Thailand). The study will explore both the safety and immunogenicity of this novel combination of HIV vaccine candidates and will formally explore the immunological impact of a prime, boost and re-boost strategy using different vaccine candidates provided by the UK HVC. It will also explore the effectiveness of combining vaccines candidate together with the added advantage of minimising the length of the regimen seen as crucial to vaccine feasibility.

A successful and safe HIV vaccine would have considerable benefits across the general populations and high risk groups. It could have the potential to prevent over 70 million infections over the course of 15 years. Should the trial identify promising vaccine constructs or strategies, the research would support the design of the next clinical studies and provide an opportunity to inform and support decisions and policy making in several areas of HIV prevention.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A safe and effective preventive HIV vaccine remains one of the highest priorities for international public health. Despite slow progress, a recent phase III trial (RV144) demonstrated significant protection against HIV infection through a prime-boost strategy with a canary-pox viral vector (ALVAC), followed by an ENV (GP120) protein boost. The immune correlates of protection remain obscure, but consensus is that both antibodies to HIV and a strong cellular immune response are required. The UK HIV Vaccine Consortium (UK HVC) has developed a series of HIV immunogens with freedom to undertake clinical research, so that diverse combinations of viral vectors, DNA, protein and adjuvant can be directly compared to define the most immunogenic vaccine immunisation strategy. By building on our previous vaccine studies, we believe that the HVC 003 DMP immunisation strategies will be more immunogenic than the partially successful RV144. The UK HVC 003 DMP trial proposes to study two prime-boost strategies using GMP products. The priming will be done with DNA followed by modified pox (MVA) and boost with rGP140 protein adjuvanted with GLA. The study will compare 3X DNA followed by 2X MVA and 2X rGP140/GLA, versus 3X DNA, followed by concurrent MVA/rGP140/GLA, with a primary end-point of ENV antibody titre and secondary end-points of neutralisation and cellular immunity. If safe and highly immunogenic, we would wish to optimise the immunisation schedule through another comparative study and proceed with a phase II/III study in East and Southern Africa, as a university-based and led public-private partnership, based on the Microbicides Development Programme model.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>822975</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Braunschweig University of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Helmholtz-Zentrum f?r Infektionsforschung</gtr:department><gtr:description>TRANSVAC</gtr:description><gtr:id>BFCAAEB8-0211-41F9-86C2-4ED04A93E36C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bioinformatice Analysis is ongoing and will lead to publication and strengthening of infrastructure and expertise within the consortium.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>aUhNHqNH37L-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Unversity of Munich supplied man power and also access to samples from vaccinated and chronically infected individuals for deep sequencing.

Four different products have been trialled and data is currently being analysed.

DNA
A two parts product including one plasmid encodes ZM96 Clade C gag-pol-nef derived from the 96ZM651-8 clone construct developed by B.H. Hahn, G.M. Shaw and F. Gao at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The other encodes CN54 Clade C env derived from the HIV-1 97CN54 coding sequences (Geneart). Both sequence optimised inserts were introduced into the VRC8400 CMV/R vector (NIAID/NIH) for GMP manufacture. Vaccines have been manufactured by Althea Technology, Inc (USA).

MVA-C
The MVA-C has been developed by M. Esteban at the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia of CSIC and expresses the HIV-1 protein gp120 and the fusion protein gag-pol-nef from HIV-1 97CN54. Volunteers will receive 1.10e8 TCID50 in a volume of 0.5mls. Vaccine has been manufactured by Bavarian Nordic (Denmark).

CN54rgp140
The CN54rgp140 is a recombinant GP140 derived from the HIV-1 CN54 coding sequence and has been manufactured by Polymun, Austria. CN54rGP140, is a trimeric recombinant C-clade ENV protein, derived from the 97CN54 Chinese viral isolate. 

GLA-AF
In the current trial we will use a completely synthetic aqueous monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL&amp;reg;) like molecule GLA-AF,. MPL is a component of human vaccines including Cervarix which is used to prevent certain types of human papilloma virus infection associated with cervical cancer and is licensed for use in the European Union.

The manufacture of these products has been paid for by a Wellcome Trust Award. This study is conducted in collaboration with the University of Surrey (Dr David Lewis).

As of November 2014 all participants have been enrolled and have completed their immunisation schedule.</gtr:description><gtr:id>29160DA8-030A-4DEC-84FB-E45FEBEF3BC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The global health burden associated with HIV continues to grow with 35 million people estimated to be living with HIV in 2014. Despite a huge expansion of access to ART with an estimated 12.9 million people on ART by the end of 2013, leaving others in urgent need of therapy whilst 2.1 million new infections were identified in the same year. With the exception of male circumcision and the challenging Pre-Exposure prophylasis there has been disappointing outcomes from most other prevention strategies on HIV incidence.

A successful and safe HIV vaccine would have considerable benefits across the general populations and high risk groups. It could have the potential to prevent over 70 million infections over the course of 15 years. Should the trial identify a promising vaccine constructs or strategies, the research would support the design of the next clinical studies and provide an opportunity to inform and support decisions and policy making in several areas of HIV prevention.

The Manufacturing process was documented and formed the basis for an online tool for researchers willing to take vaccine candidates from the bench to the clinic.

From Bench to Clinic is a webtool to help researchers most efficiently move their candidate vaccines into first-in-human trials. With a focus on the practical steps that need to be accomplished before a clinical trial can be initiated, this tool is intended to acquaint researchers, funders and advocates, with the processes, costs and timelines involved in the first phase of product development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>e5hZRXw7pW6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:title>Spoke 003 Study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Vaccines</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=14173</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2012</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>INFORM database captured trial participant information for analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC0188CD-1C36-46AF-996C-8B8D075E8F56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This database has allowed statistical evaluation of primary data from the trial.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdcdf65ab9a5.39128789</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>INFORM ORACLE</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1832B448-D66E-4492-A126-CE5991FE6B59</gtr:id><gtr:title>poster: What are the best methods to recruit healthy volunteers into HIV vaccine trials?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/67bb48fefeaa37bfbb0c929b44097427"><gtr:id>67bb48fefeaa37bfbb0c929b44097427</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones CB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545ba965ee9d25.38275916</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0DCDE777-A8A4-4ABB-ABE1-4984818BFE60</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Comparative Phase I Study of Combination, Homologous Subtype-C DNA, MVA, and Env gp140 Protein/Adjuvant HIV Vaccines in Two Immunization Regimes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in immunology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c886ea6a1f8c575a3e82ba71366caa9"><gtr:id>7c886ea6a1f8c575a3e82ba71366caa9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joseph S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-3224</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bfdda6c75267.92313574</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4715228-1575-4D0C-A5FE-BBA4B6321FBF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glucopyranosyl lipid A adjuvant significantly enhances HIV specific T and B cell responses elicited by a DNA-MVA-protein vaccine regimen.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a28d6b1b37d4662bdc279f558e55c7c0"><gtr:id>a28d6b1b37d4662bdc279f558e55c7c0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay PF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545cd1947092c4.19680130</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1001784</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>D8F3A27D-084A-40BB-A046-087DACE23410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.4  Vaccines</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
