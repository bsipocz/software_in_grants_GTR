While it is often taken for granted that there are silences at museums and historic sites, the processes by which they operate have been less explicitly conceptualised. This network will make a distinction between 'being silenced' and 'being silent' in order to look at the ways in which histories perceived as challenging or 'difficult' are conveyed and taught by education officers in museums and at historic sites. As part of such teaching, museums and historic sites now frequently employ strategies of empathy to confront difficult pasts. The network will draw on the body of work about empathy and issues of accessibility in order to interrogate the ways in which empathy is being identified in the generic learning outcomes.\n\nThe network will bring together academics, early career researchers, doctoral students, curators, and educators to work in a genuinely interdisciplinary way. The diversity of expertise within the network will facilitate a focus on different cultural conceptions of silence and empathy and the way that such understandings are (or are not) part of dominant understandings of memory. The collaboration of academics and practitioners will promote an understanding of how silence, empathy and memory interact in museums and at historic sites. The findings will be of significance for museum and heritage site professionals, policy makers and educators across the sectors. \n\nThe network will run three workshops and one conference at the University of Birmingham, City University, the Historic Royal Palaces Tower of London, and Buckfast Abbey respectively. These meetings will be structured to promote dialogue, collaboration and progression of the fields. \nThe network will maintain a website and blog throughout its duration to strengthen the exchange of ideas, report back on the workshops, maintain the impetus beyond the life of the initial project, and attract interest more widely from the constituencies of the members. The steering group will also disseminate the results via a website, blog, training day for educators, conference papers, co-authored articles, and special issue of a journal. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Museum and Heritage Site Professionals:\nOn the basis of the MLA Challenging History report (see Pathways to Impact), there is a demonstrable need for debate and dialogue across the themes identified, themes with particular contemporary currency. Articulating the role and 'impact' of educational programmes is crucial, especially when issues around human rights, identity, citizenship and meaning making are at stake. One aspiration is that the network will feed into and hopefully influence current practice through dissemination within the professional sector. There are many active networks within the field of heritage interpretation and education who would be interested in the results of the research. Museum and heritage site professionals within the Museums Association, the Social History Curators' Group, the Museums, Libraries and Archive Council (MLA), the Group for Education in Museums, the Historical Association, the International Museum Theatre Alliance, and the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience will be informed of the outcomes of the network via trade publications, the website, conference and existing forums. \n\n2. Policy Makers:\nGiven the size and complexity of the museum, gallery and heritage sector within the UK, it is important to state that this study is concerned primarily with publicly-funded museums and historic sites in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Within England, policy makers within the fields of heritage (under the Department for Culture Media &amp;amp; Sport, DCMS) and education will be informed of the outcomes of the research via the MLA who are the government agency responsible for leading on museum policy in partnership with English Heritage. In addition, MLA contacts at the Department for Education and Department for Business Innovation and Skills will be kept up to date with developments and recommendations. More widely within the UK, members of the network with pre-existing contacts to CyMAL: Museums, Archives and Libraries Wales, Scottish Museums Council (SMC), Northern Ireland Museum Council (NIMC), Historic Scotland, CADW: Welsh Historic Monuments, English Heritage, Environment Heritage Service Northern Ireland, and the National Trust will further ensure dissemination of the network findings.\nThere is also potential for impact on international policy through network contacts with the UNESCO Associated Schools Network, the UNESCO Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage initiative (via existing MLA contacts with the International Council of Museums and European partners within the Grundtvig Map for International Development project) and through the Tower Education Service's connections with the Making Sense of our Sites programme (a UK-wide initiative launched in 2009 that aims to help UK World Heritage Sites enhance their offer of World Heritage focused education for schools, funded by UK National Commission for UNESCO and the DCMS). Contacts engendered by the Challenging History group (see Pathways to Impact) will be a useful complement, adding weight to the findings and strength to the voice.\n\n3. Educational programmers:\nAs demonstrated by the MLA Challenging History report, findings of the research will be incredibly useful for helping educators (in museums and in formal education outlets) think about and deal with silence within education programmes. Questions around the use of empathy in education, the place of experiential learning, and what constitutes 'meaning making' in the study of history are of great currency. There may also be significant impact on the study of citizenship in museums and formal education through initiatives such as the Take One Building scheme championed by HRP Tower of London as well as the British Library's Campaign! Make an Impact project. Steering Group experience in running such initiatives will form the basis of a train</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21495</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>With New Eyes... explores whether documentary can become an experience or a journey beyond the screen.

This is a time of unprecedented change, pressure and evolution for museums and their continued investment of resources in this area is not assured. The conference directly addressed those contexts, and suggested imaginative responses to them, helping delegates to explore why and how challenging histories maintain their relevance.

The conference programme included keynotes from:

David Anderson, Director General Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, on 'Avoiding Challenging History'

Samantha Heywood, Director, Museum of World War II, Boston on 'The challenges of challenging history in the 'real' world'

Stephen Bourne, Scholar and Writer, on 'Black Poppies'

David Gunn, Artist/Producer, on 'Museums of Lies and Secrets'

It also included a performance from electro-folk storytellers 'Harp and A Monkey', a performance of 'Graveyard Voices', a number of off-site sessions and tours, two drinks receptions, and a three-course meal at Cardiff Prison. There were a range of high quality papers, panels and workshops, and pportunities to network and exchange in a 'campfire session' and a 'failure cafe'.

The conference was invited to be a part of the Wales Festival of Innovation.

Questions we explored included

* Is it appropriate to re-imagine the role of museums and museum professionals as activists or as civil society mediators?
* How does our understanding of 'impact' in museums (and Universities also) frame what kind of work with challenging history is deemed viable?
* Do museums' current methodologies need re-imagining?
* How are online-only museums free to imagine their work with challenging histories differently?
* Is there a role for gaming, play and mischief-making in work with difficult and sensitive subject matters?
* What is the role of academic research in re-imagining well-known challenging topics?
* How does all of this link into wider discussions about museums' survival in 2016 and beyond?

The conference was sponsored by the Arts and Humanities Research Council World War One Engagement Centre: Voices of War and Peace http://www.voicesofwarandpeace.org/. Debates about Challenging History are currently being framed against the backdrop of this very high profile and ongoing commemoration. A strand of the conference was therefore dedicated to papers that focused on the lessons that can be learned from dealing with this topic, including the ways in which it informs, challenges or intersects with other histories.

Conference sub-themes included:

*Re-imagining commemoration: WW1 and beyond
*Re-imagining space for challenging history
*Re-imagining participation | experience | engagement
*Re-imagining authenticity
*Re-imagining digital
*Re-imagining the political dimensions of museums' work
*Re-imagining relationships | audiences | visitors
*Re-imagining empathy
*Re-imagining silence
*Re-imagining value
*Re-imagining social justice</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82610284fc5.74930175</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://challenginghistorynetwork.wordpress.com/2016-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote: Making The Case for Heritage Education</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B76685D-A113-4D90-AC99-48A8248EFC69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was followed by a lively discussion.

Through a series of three workshops and one conference the group has developed a series of typologies and conceptualisations of silence in museums and heritage sites. It has investigated the processes of silence, silencing and agency in diverse geographical, musealogical and heritage contexts. 
? The network has begun work on linking the processes of silence to the role of empathy in museums, work which is continuing via the publications arising from the conference.
? A website and blog have had 10,524 views since the launch, from 98 countries. The website continues to get 20 to 60 views a week. The blog was set up to be outward facing, informing all those interested in the activities of the group, and the links members were making to wider debates about the central themes (including links to popular culture and news stories). A few prolific posters kept momentum on the blog, and were rewarded with high numbers of views.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The workshops, and particularly workshop 3, indicated that there was still much work to be done on the transmedia museum. While this practice is already established to a certain extent in the heritage context (see https://silencememoryempathy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/cardiff-transmedia-drago.pdf), there is still work
