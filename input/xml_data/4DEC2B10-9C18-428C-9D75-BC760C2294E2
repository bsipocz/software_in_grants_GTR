It is the primary goal of DIAMM to provide the best possible access to valuable, fragile and rare documents for a worldwide community of users, from scholars and performers to the general interested members of public. In some cases DIAMM provides users with better access than that which they could obtain by direct examination of the original source. High-quality digital images offer radically improved opportunities for close and comparative manuscript study, and have facilitated a level of detailed discovery by using magnificiation beyond that achievable with the naked eye.\n\nSince the inception of the project in 1998, this goal has been met and exceeded by adding to the foundation image archive a rich metadata environment in which the manuscript images are placed, and by the development of a sophisticated online environment to deliver the images, without charge, to end users. By 2006 the original collection of some 368 manuscript sources (approx. 7500 images) was being accessed repeatedly by 412 registered users. The website is currently a portal to detailed catalogue listings for 3127 manuscript sources (many recently discovered, and some described uniquely here), and provides access to nearly 15,000 images, although these images comprise only 15% of the sources listed. Web statistics show very active usage of the website (http://www.diamm.ac.uk/awstats/awstats) with over 2000 currently registered users and an average of over 7000 hits per day to the website, many of those from repeat users. This level of activity already exists despite the fact that full searchability of the sources and inventory information is not yet available.\n\nThis resource depends on an intricate database of information that is currently being made available for complex searching and the creation of customizable lists or saved searches, together with the best possible online delivery of our archive-quality images by the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) based at King's College, London. However, the data available to users depends on creation of new content and the establishment of complex linkages between sources and works that is undertaken by the project team. The original catalogue information for many manuscripts was created over half a century ago. New descriptions need to be written for manuscripts where more recent research has uncovered new or more accurate information. This must be done by researchers with a significant research background in this field, with a level of expertise suitable for the accurate creation of this type of information.\n\nAlthough new images are constantly added to the archive thanks to individual research projects that commission DIAMM to undertake photography on their behalf, these projects do not necessarily allow the collection to maintain a cohesive coverage of the entire repertory: signal lacunae exist. The current project will provide images for some of the more important of these missing sources. A camera upgrade will enable the project to use single-shot technology for sources that are of a size that currently requires use of slow scanning-back imaging, thus increasing throughput from c.80 images/day to c.400 images/day, making many projects practically feasible for the first time.\n\nThe application also seeks to provide the project with a project manager/researcher and clerical assistants for a year, during which time the database content can continue to be enhanced, expanded and updated, and photography of several important sources can be undertaken.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The web resource, presently an excellent and widely-used research resource, would be very considerably enhanced by providing users with tools that extend the boundaries of what is possible simply by delivering an online version of the two catalogues, RISM and CCM. This is currently the focus of development work on the website front end which will allow a new level of searchability and customization of content to suit the needs of all users, whatever their level of interest or expertise. \n\nApart from the academic community, the resource is used by, and benefits, the following worldwide communities:\n\n1. Performers. The performance of early music increasingly creates a demand for access to original sources rather than to editions that merely reflect the decisions and ideas of a single editor. As performers become more critical of their traditional dependence on transcriptions by others and seek to extend their repertory, they need access to primary source material. This access is provided by DIAMM. When joined by information on how to transcribe from early notations, the resource will have a much wider effectiveness. Collaborations with a number of ensembles are already established.\n\n2. Medieval enthusiasts. Only a few other resources are able to offer free access to medieval sources at such high quality, and of such diversity of date, provenance and context. Not only have medievalists worldwide come to use the resource as a teaching aid, but members of the general public are also regular visitors.\n\n3. Collections/Libraries/Archives Institutions are thus also major users of the resource. The images and the metadata increase exposure for their collections and supports them as institutions by providing access to their collections without cost to them. This is particularly important for small archives with limited resources for creating an online presence, but has also been taken up by much larger institutions.\n\n4. Schools. A crucial user group is children of primary- and secondary-school age and their teachers. Projects on medieval life, general history and music have been enriched by direct visual access to the documents the children are studying. This in turn creates an interest in medieval studies that is carried through from primary to secondary education, and from there into tertiary studies. This feed-through should serve to arrest the recent 'presentist' trend in chronological focus in HE music courses. The cost and simple practical difficulty of accessing these rare and increasingly delicate documents has in the past prevented young scholars from engaging with them: departments were beginning to consider that teaching about music of this period to be impractical. Increasing interest in the period is now being generated by DIAMM, and the ease of access to documents and to information about them it provides is reversing this trend.\n\n5. Technical consultancy and imaging for other projects which themselves have a non-academic impact. As well as providing a research resource, DIAMM offers imaging consultancy for specialist imaging needs outside academia and the website serves as a model for various aspects of technical delivery. DIAMM is able to deliver content for other projects, both musical and non-musical. In the iteration of the website under development, it will deliver images for the Lancelot Graal project at the University of Pittsburgh, and may also create online access to images from the music collection at Christ Church, Oxford, the Bangor Pontifical and the Winchester Bible (all the subject of imaging initiatives in collaboration with DIAMM).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189136</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>-</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB4403D5-99D6-4FAD-A7EA-EC97C999A696</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-9799358146.078287a70ffa66</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Display of information about DIAMM and DIAMM Publications.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>-</gtr:description><gtr:id>94B5FE06-5C82-4E36-9F89-1DC0BE6188AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-2876792403.754585a713ec34</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Performance of music from DIAMM publications to visitors attending launch.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Luxury facsimiles.</gtr:description><gtr:id>55B3A3E6-65FA-460C-8ADC-EDABDC2DC760</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-244698552.6426682a70f9878</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Exhibition of DIAMM Publications.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Austrian National Library</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with the Austrian National Library (Vienna) to obtain and display images of manuscripts from that library on the DIAMM resource.</gtr:description><gtr:id>374EAE92-65DB-4611-A5B3-11522E5A4981</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95b1b48b95b1b5c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Information taken from Final Report</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Vienna</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Musicology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with the University of Vienna Institute of Musicology</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB6C9958-D076-4AFE-BF55-E92470AA263E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9585ef8b9585f0c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration with research project 'Musical Life', Prof Reinhard Strohm</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Newcastle</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Tudor Partbooks</gtr:description><gtr:id>EDFF061F-C7F7-45F0-BF42-271D875DD6F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54451024483ad4.24573896-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Contribution of c. 7000 images to DIAMM online resource</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>DIAMM provides digital imaging, publication expertise (typesetting, image preparation), expert image restoration work, image storage, image delivery through DIAMM website</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) SHRC Partnership Grant, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, Montreal, director Prof Ichiro Fujinaga.
Musical scores are a central resource for music research. SIMSSA targets digitized (scanned) music scores as part of a larger program, the Networked Environment for Music Analysis, to design a 21st-century infrastructure for analyzing all types of music media. There are two major obstacles to the use of online musical scores. An unprecedented number of musical scores are available on the Internet: all across the world libraries, archives, and museums are digitizing their print and manuscript books and scores. No standards exist currently, however, to unify these collections so that digital scores can be found in one place. It is also virtually impossible to perform content-based searches of online scores (in contrast with digitized text). There is simply no reliable optical music recognition (OMR) software comparable to the optical character recognition (OCR) software that institutions use to make text collections searchable. In order to gather scores in one place we will develop ways to locate the music scores found inside digitized books (Google Books, Internet Archive, etc.). We will then index the information centrally at our website so that in the future, each digital object will be easily locatable. In other words, we will be creating a union catalogue of digitized scores. In order to make the scores searchable, the images must be processed further using OMR. We will deploy two state-of-the-art OMR technologies currently under development. We are particularly committed to providing OMR solutions for older music notation systems. Searchable musical scores will enable us to ask new questions about music, and provide better answers to old ones. Now is the moment to create a new research environment and a new set of research tools.

Tudor Partbooks: the manuscript legacies of John Sadler, John Baldwin and their antecedents, funded by the AHRC, director Dr Magnus Williamson, co-investigator Dr Julia Craig-McFeely
Tudor Partbooks investigates English music manuscripts from the 1510s to the 1580s, in particular two Elizabethan partbook sets. Among several outputs, the Sadler partbooks will be published in facsimile, digitally restored to their state in the 1570s, before they were degraded by John Sadler's acidic ink; the Baldwin partbooks will be published with a replacement Tenor partbook contrapuntally restored by a team of specialists. The RA will assist in the preparation of these outputs, in the editing of electronic outputs (digital images, podcasts and VLE), and in convening project meetings and managing relationships with project collaborators.

The Alamire Foundation (Leuven) funded by the Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie
In October 2011, The Alamire Foundation was awarded funds to follow an ambitious programme of digitization and technical activity over three years, to create a permanent resource celebrating the work of the scriptorium of Petrus Alamire. Included was funding to provide DIAMM project mangement and photography to support these activities.

Sources of British Song funded by the British Academy, the Music &amp;amp; Letters Trust and Royal Holloway, University of London, Director Helen Deeming
Sources of British Song, c.1150-1300 is an online resource for the study of manuscripts of medieval song, in particular those written in Britain in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It makes available to scholars, students and performers high-quality digital images of the original manuscripts of song, accompanied by up-to-date source descriptions and specialised analyses of their musical notations. Many of the manuscripts remain little known, and over half the surviving songs have never before been published. The web resource is hosted by DIAMM, and images of the manuscripts can also be accessed here.

The Cantus Database, University of Waterloo, Principal investigator Prof. Debra Lacoste
CANTUS is a database that assembles indices of the Latin ecclesiastical chants found in early manuscript and printed sources for the liturgical Office, such as antiphoners and breviaries. This digital archive benefits scholars in a variety of fields including ecclesiastical monody, the sacred polyphony of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, liturgical drama, hagiography, paleography, philology, ecclesiastical history and the history of monasticism, as well as performers of this early music (including church musicians and directors of liturgy), librarians and archivists.

Cantum pulcriorem invenire, funded by the AHRC, University of Southampton, director Prof. Mark Everist
The aim of Cantum pulcriorem invenire is to place the conductusof the period c 1170 to c 1320 on the same footing as its two partner genres, the motet and organum. It seeks to achieve this aim by working in three domains simultaneously: conventional musicological scholarship, digital music bibliography, and practice-based research. There is a central objective to each of these three domains, followed by a fourth destined to secure sustainability for work in medieval studies in music.

Musical Life of the late Middle Ages in the Austrian Region (1340-1520), Institut f&amp;uuml;r Musikwissenschaft, Universit&amp;auml;t Wien, director Prof. dr. Birgit Lodes
Musical Life is a research project which aims to produce new evidence about the musical culture in the Austrian region in the period c. 1340- c. 1520. It is a scholarly investigation of the cultural significance of music, based on documents such as musical scores, archival documents, literary sources, images of art, architecture and material remains, which it embeds in a new historiography of musical life in the region. The text is written in a language that is understandable to non-specialists, and laid out in the guise of a museum catalogue; its 40 short chapters usually focus on selected significant pieces of music and/or documents. Musical sound examples are also offered.

The Production and Reading of Music Sources (PRoMS) funded by the AHRC, University of Manchester, director Prof. Thomas Schmidt.
This AHRC-funded project, a collaboration between Manchester University, the Warburg Institute (School of Advanced Studies, University of London) and the Department of Digital Humanities (King's College London) presents the first integrated resource for the study of the production and reading of polyphonic music sources from the period c.1480 to c. 1530 in a European context. This will be achieved through a systematic analysis and description of the mise-en-page: the ways in which verbal text, musical notation and other graphic devices interact on the pages of manuscripts and printed editions of that time.

Wode partbooks project, University of Edinburgh, director Prof. Jane Dawson
The main project funded by the AHRC ran from 2007-11 and its follow-on project 'Sing the Renaissance and Reformation' from 2012-13. The Edinburgh research team led by Jane Dawson was drawn from Music and the University Library as well as Divinity. Its international partners were the British Library, Trinity College, Dublin, and Georgetown University, Washington DC. The main project culminated in a major exhibition at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival telling the story of psalm singing in Britain at the time of the Reformation. It brought together for the first time all eight surviving Wode Psalter manuscripts and created digital images for permanent viewing. These Part-books form one of the most important collections of early modern Scottish music, including harmonisations for the metrical psalms. Highly illustrated and scattered with marginalia, the Part-books provide many valuable insights and connections with the world of Reformation Britain. Concerts, a musical CD, psalm-singing and academic workshops, subsidiary exhibitions, school resources, an IPhone App and eBook were all produced for the main project and 'Sing the Renaissance and Reformation' is bringing modern musical editions to amateur and church choirs.

Collaborative digitization project with Universidad Complutense de Madrid and W&amp;uuml;rzburg University, Germany, supervised by David Catalunya.
This project through two tranches of funding so far has paid for the digitization of little-known manuscripts of polyphony throughout Spain by DIAMM imaging, images delivered through this website. Negotiations and diplomacy was undertaken by David Catalunya who also facilitated the travel and logistics. This project is ongoing and has plans for digitization of further manuscript sources.

Urbane Musik un Stadtdesign zur Zeit der fr&amp;uuml;hen Habsburger. Wien im 14-15 Jahrhundert. Konservatorium City of Vienna University, director Prof. Susan Zapke; funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)
The topic intends to contribute to the urban- and cultural history of Vienna in the period from the end oft he 14th to the beginning of the 16th century. It includes the facts between the first foundation of the University of Vienna in the year 1365 and its decline at the start of the 16th century - among others the denominational disputes, the siege of Vienna and further internal issues. That was the time of crucial historical developments such as the Council of Konstanz, the Council of Basel and the monastic reform of Melk under Duke Albrecht V. Their consequences had a significant impact on the whole of Austria and are closely linked to the central object of this research project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6731521176.85556566ae5c20</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset includes inventories, bibliographical information and details on sources and composers.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.diamm.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2006</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database lists every known MS of polyphonic music up to c. 1650, and the entire database is delivered online via a Solr search interface and MySQL database.

No standards exist currently, however, to unify these collections so that digital scores can be found in one place. It is also virtually impossible to perform content-based searches of online scores (in contrast with digitized text). There is simply no reliable optical music recognition (OMR) software comparable to the optical character recognition (OCR) software that institutions use to make text collections searchable. In order to gather scores in one place we will develop ways to locate the music scores found inside digitized books (Google Books, Internet Archive, etc.). We will then index the information centrally at our website so that in the future, each digital object will be easily locatable. In other words, we will be creating a union catalogue of digitized scores. In order to make the scores searchable, the images must be processed further using OMR. We will deploy two state-of-the-art OMR technologies currently under development. We are particularly committed to providing OMR solutions for older music notation systems. Searchable musical scores will enable us to ask new questions about music, and provide better answers to old ones. Now is the moment to create a new research environment and a new set of research tools.

Tudor Partbooks: the manuscript legacies of John Sadler, John Baldwin and their antecedents, funded by the AHRC, director Dr Magnus Williamson, co-investigator Dr Julia Craig-McFeely
Tudor Partbooks investigates English music manuscripts from the 1510s to the 1580s, in particular two Elizabethan partbook sets. Among several outputs, the Sadler partbooks will be published in facsimile, digitally restored to their state in the 1570s, before they were degraded by John Sadler's acidic ink; the Baldwin partbooks will be published with a replacement Tenor partbook contrapuntally restored by a team of specialists. The RA will assist in the preparation of these outputs, in the editing of electronic outputs (digital images, podcasts and VLE), and in convening project meetings and managing relationships with project collaborators.

The Alamire Foundation (Leuven) funded by the Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie
In October 2011, The Alamire Foundation was awarded funds to follow an ambitious programme of digitization and technical activity over three years, to create a permanent resource celebrating the work of the scriptorium of Petrus Alamire. Included was funding to provide DIAMM project mangement and photography to support these activities.

Sources of British Song funded by the British Academy, the Music &amp;amp; Letters Trust and Royal Holloway, University of London, Director Helen Deeming
Sources of British Song, c.1150-1300 is an online resource for the study of manuscripts of medieval song, in particular those written in Britain in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It makes available to scholars, students and performers high-quality digital images of the original manuscripts of song, accompanied by up-to-date source descriptions and specialised analyses of their musical notations. Many of the manuscripts remain little known, and over half the surviving songs have never before been published. The web resource is hosted by DIAMM, and images of the manuscripts can also be accessed here.

The Cantus Database, University of Waterloo, Principal investigator Prof. Debra Lacoste
CANTUS is a database that assembles indices of the Latin ecclesiastical chants found in early manuscript and printed sources for the liturgical Office, such as antiphoners and breviaries. This digital archive benefits scholars in a variety of fields including ecclesiastical monody, the sacred polyphony of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, liturgical drama, hagiography, paleography, philology, ecclesiastical history and the history of monasticism, as well as performers of this early music (including church musicians and directors of liturgy), librarians and archivists.

Cantum pulcriorem invenire, funded by the AHRC, University of Southampton, director Prof. Mark Everist
The aim of Cantum pulcriorem invenire is to place the conductusof the period c 1170 to c 1320 on the same footing as its two partner genres, the motet and organum. It seeks to achieve this aim by working in three domains simultaneously: conventional musicological scholarship, digital music bibliography, and practice-based research. There is a central objective to each of these three domains, followed by a fourth destined to secure sustainability for work in medieval studies in music.

Musical Life of the late Middle Ages in the Austrian Region (1340-1520), Institut f&amp;uuml;r Musikwissenschaft, Universit&amp;auml;t Wien, director Prof. dr. Birgit Lodes
Musical Life is a research project which aims to produce new evidence about the musical culture in the Austrian region in the period c. 1340- c. 1520. It is a scholarly investigation of the cultural significance of music, based on documents such as musical scores, archival documents, literary sources, images of art, architecture and material remains, which it embeds in a new historiography of musical life in the region. The text is written in a language that is understandable to non-specialists, and laid out in the guise of a museum catalogue; its 40 short chapters usually focus on selected significant pieces of music and/or documents. Musical sound examples are also offered.

The Production and Reading of Music Sources (PRoMS) funded by the AHRC, University of Manchester, director Prof. Thomas Schmidt.
This AHRC-funded project, a collaboration between Manchester University, the Warburg Institute (School of Advanced Studies, University of London) and the Department of Digital Humanities (King's College London) presents the first integrated resource for the study of the production and reading of polyphonic music sources from the period c.1480 to c. 1530 in a European context. This will be achieved through a systematic analysis and description of the mise-en-page: the ways in which verbal text, musical notation and other graphic devices interact on the pages of manuscripts and printed editions of that time.

Wode partbooks project, University of Edinburgh, director Prof. Jane Dawson
The main project funded by the AHRC ran from 2007-11 and its follow-on project 'Sing the Renaissance and Reformation' from 2012-13. The Edinburgh research team led by Jane Dawson was drawn from Music and the University Library as well as Divinity. Its international partners were the British Library, Trinity College, Dublin, and Georgetown University, Washington DC. The main project culminated in a major exhibition at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival telling the story of psalm singing in Britain at the time of the Reformation. It brought together for the first time all eight surviving Wode Psalter manuscripts and created digital images for permanent viewing. These Part-books form one of the most important collections of early modern Scottish music, including harmonisations for the metrical psalms. Highly illustrated and scattered with marginalia, the Part-books provide many valuable insights and connections with the world of Reformation Britain. Concerts, a musical CD, psalm-singing and academic workshops, subsidiary exhibitions, school resources, an IPhone App and eBook were all produced for the main project and 'Sing the Renaissance and Reformation' is bringing modern musical editions to amateur and church choirs.

Collaborative digitization project with Universidad Complutense de Madrid and W&amp;uuml;rzburg University, Germany, supervised by David Catalunya.
This project through two tranches of funding so far has paid for the digitization of little-known manuscripts of polyphony throughout Spain by DIAMM imaging, images delivered through this website. Negotiations and diplomacy was undertaken by David Catalunya who also facilitated the travel and logistics. This project is ongoing and has plans for digitization of further manuscript sources.

Urbane Musik un Stadtdesign zur Zeit der fr&amp;uuml;hen Habsburger. Wien im 14-15 Jahrhundert. Konservatorium City of Vienna University, director Prof. Susan Zapke; funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)
The topic intends to contribute to the urban- and cultural history of Vienna in the period from the end oft he 14th to the beginning of the 16th century. It includes the facts between the first foundation of the University of Vienna in the year 1365 and its decline at the start of the 16th century - among others the denominational disputes, the siege of Vienna and further internal issues. That was the time of crucial historical developments such as the Council of Konstanz, the Council of Basel and the monastic reform of Melk under Duke Albrecht V. Their consequences had a significant impact on the whole of Austria and are closely linked to the central object of this research project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9737908690.9237466d630e2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database feeds information for the website. www.diamm.ac.uk</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.diamm.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2006</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E47E4A4D-8D1A-49FA-947C-5586C724BC23</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Eton Choirbook: Facsimile and Introductory Study</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/44c4dff9babf0c787f48416a56b249a0"><gtr:id>44c4dff9babf0c787f48416a56b249a0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williamson Magnus</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781907647000</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54450421eb5462.77824968</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05E2374F-D95C-48AF-B565-A9345D3E8566</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proceedings of University of Pennsylvania Schoenberg Symposium 2010'.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/411e5e3a589b9e5242cc778a00c299ef"><gtr:id>411e5e3a589b9e5242cc778a00c299ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dr Elizabeth Leach (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_158717070913b9f362</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0A9C856-DE2A-4DB3-9078-5C6C7ACBA8C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Dow Partbooks: Oxford, Christ Church Mus. 984 - 988</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1e2233fae2c122c035631749e62e2e88"><gtr:id>1e2233fae2c122c035631749e62e2e88</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milsom John</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781907647024</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544504222c4996.70484439</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C5E2B6B-2508-4146-955A-FE38D3B20F84</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Optical Neume Recognition Project and MEI</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/498816df5354a8bff3e0a484d077970e"><gtr:id>498816df5354a8bff3e0a484d077970e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Helsen, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56deba7d53ee60.21060881</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17777B8A-4ED3-4208-9F21-D1DA35B1F895</gtr:id><gtr:title>An MEI score alignment application</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0f65c0ae3c4026e108a356e14e6c6fdb"><gtr:id>0f65c0ae3c4026e108a356e14e6c6fdb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Horwitz, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56debab6176fb3.00342139</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAB3782F-6484-4239-939A-8BC60E2B3607</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital Man and the desire for physical objects</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Early Music</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49c7ed12b76e8e1b5b5d486314a1e27c"><gtr:id>49c7ed12b76e8e1b5b5d486314a1e27c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craig-McFeely J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d046046564d2cb</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C462865-F2D8-45D9-A523-C37231F38C74</gtr:id><gtr:title>?
