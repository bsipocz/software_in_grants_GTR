These insects cause significant economic losses in staple food and bioenergy crops, including potato, soybean, cereals, and oilseed rape. Aphid infestations are expected to increase in the future as a result of environmental changes and increased restrictions on the use of pesticides. To develop durable approaches and achieve sustainable control of aphid epidemics, it is critical to understand aphid parasitism at the molecular level. Key questions herein are: What proteins do aphids deliver inside host plants to enable infestation? How do aphids affect host cell processes? Can we generate crop varieties that have durable resistance to aphids, and thereby reduce dependence on pesticides? 

Like most plant parasites, aphids require intimate associations with their hosts to gain access to nutrients. Aphids have specialized mouthparts, stylets, which they use to probe different plant cell types, and to feed on plant sap in the plant vascular system. Interestingly, aphid feeding induces clogging of phloem sieve elements in the plant vascular system, which is suppressed by aphids in successful host interactions. Furthermore, aphids can perturb plant developmental processes by, for example, inducing leaf curling or the formation of galls. Suppression of plant defences and altering host physiology is common among plant pathogens and generally involves the secretion of pathogen molecules, or effectors, into host plants that manipulate plant cellular processes. This manipulation of plant cell processes may involve suppression of host defences as well as altering plant cellular processes to promote the release of nutrients through targeting of specific plant (defence) proteins. Recent evidence suggests that aphids, like other plant parasites, secrete effectors that share functional features with plant pathogen effectors. 

Among the over 5000 aphid species, Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) is one of the most destructive pests worldwide, partly due to its broad host range that spans hundreds of different plant species. This host range includes important crop plants, including potato, as well as model plants Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana for which an extensive set of experimental tools and resources are available. In this project, we aim to identify effectors from the aphid species M. persicae and characterize their role in plant infestation. More specifically, we will perform functional assays in N. benthamiana plants to identify novel (candidate) M. persicae effectors. To investigate the role of aphid effectors in plant cell manipulation, we will identify the plant proteins in N. benthamiana and potato that are directly targeted, and potentially modified, by M. persicae effectors. Also, we will determine the contribution of identified M. persicae effector plant targets to plant infestation. The expected results of this project will allow a comprehensive view of the strategies that aphids employ to infest plants. Specifically, this work will implicate plant and insect proteins in an economically important interaction. An understanding of the plant cellular processes targeted by aphids and the effectors required for parasitism will facilitate the development of novel and sustainable aphid control strategies to increase crop yield and reduce pesticide usage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aphids are phloem-feeding insect that cause significant economic losses worldwide. Myzus persicae is one of the most destructive aphid species, partly due to its very broad host range. Recent studies identified salivary proteins from M. persicae that share functional features with plant pathogen effectors. With the emerging concept that aphids, like plant pathogens, deliver effectors inside their hosts to promote infestation, understanding the functions of these secreted molecules is key for development of novel and sustainable control strategies.

The overall aim of this proposal is to understand how aphids modify host cellular processes and promote infestation. Specifically, we will aim to functionally characterize aphid effectors, identify their plant host targets, and understand the roles of these targets in host-aphid associations. We will identify and characterize novel M. persicae effectors by: 1) In planta over-expression of M. persicae candidate effectors in combination with aphid performance assays; 2) Localization of M. persicae candidate effectors in planta using fluorescent fusion-proteins; 3) Identification, using Yeast-2-Hybrid (Y2H) assays and in planta pull-down experiments, of host plant targets of M. persicae effectors; 4) Investigating the contribution of M. persicae effector targets to aphid virulence using in planta host target silencing and over-expression in combination with aphid performance assays.

This project will implicate plant and aphid proteins in an economically important interaction. Furthermore, this work will provide a snapshot of the plant-aphid interface and may unveil processes relevant to unrelated but important plant-insect interactions. Therefore, results are expected to impact the development of novel control strategies with low environmental and economic costs that are applicable to most if not all important crops.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project fits with the BBSRC strategic priorities of &amp;quot;food security&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bio-energy and industrial biotechnology&amp;quot;. In addition, the proposed project is complementary to ongoing research at the James Hutton Institute (JHI) supported by Scottish Government work-packages, which aims to understand and combat potato diseases, including those caused by aphids and aphid-transmitted viruses. Findings of the proposed research will, in the long term, contribute to the development of novel strategies to control infestations by aphids and potentially other pests, thereby improving crop yields and food security both in the UK and elsewhere, including in developing countries. With some of the aphid host plants, like oilseed rape, playing an important role in bio-fuel production, increasing crop yields is expected to positively impact the generation of bio-energy. The proposed research is expected to benefit i) plant breeding and biotechnology companies, ii) farmers worldwide, including in developing countries, iii) the general public (including potential future academics), and iv) research staff. 

The proposed project will benefit plant breeding and biotechnology companies in developing novel and effective control strategies against infestations of aphids and other pests. The proposed project may potentially reveal aphid effectors that are essential for plant infestation, and consequentially are interesting targets for the development of chemical control compounds. Furthermore, identification of plant (defence) proteins that are targeted by aphid effectors may provide key information for generating novel resistances in economically important crops. Finally, the identification of aphid salivary proteins may help elucidate virus transmission mechanisms. Thus, the development of novel efficient aphid control strategies will increase crop yields, while reducing pesticide costs, for farmers in the UK and elsewhere, including in developing countries.

A reduction in the use of insecticides will benefit the general public. Currently, aphid control strategies, and those of other plant pests, rely on the use of pesticides that are a threat to human and environmental health. By enabling sustainable agriculture, the proposed project will contribute to a natural environment and reduce the environmental impact of agricultural practices.

The PI of the proposed project is committed to actively contribute to outreach activities to engage the general public and potential future academics. The PI will actively be involved in the JHI's outreach program. In addition, the PI and the PDRA hired on the project will display the work, as relevant to society, at the local outreach events, such as those organized by the Dundee Science Centre, attended by local schools and the general public. In addition, the PI will train summer students, honours students, and interns in laboratory techniques to engage potential future academics in biological sciences research. 

Research staff involved in the proposed project will benefit in terms of career development. The proposed research draws on a vast array of molecular biology and biochemistry techniques that are considered transferable skills in the biological sciences. Upon completion of the work, staff will have developed excellent research skills. In addition, the PDRA and PI will seek to further develop their professional skills by communicating science to the general public and industry. The identification and characterization of aphid effectors and their host targets will have a significant impact in the fields of plant-insect and plant-microbe interactions and thereby increase the profile of the PI and PDRA. With results of the proposed research expected to be of high impact and of great interest to the research community, this project will likely generate multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals as well as lead to invitations to national and international meetings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>364549</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk-Host cell modulation by aphid effector proteins</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0295832-37FC-4D4F-8076-7347ACAACB3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk, Sainsbury Laboratory, September 2012

The latter three will represent the main findings of the paper, that is, novel aphid effector-host target interactions. Also, we have generated evidence these host targets contribute to plant defences or susceptibility to aphids. This is a major advance within the field and an important step forward in understanding how aphids manipulate their hosts. We have set-up an aphid saliva collection display to illustrate to the general audience how we can look for proteins in aphid saliva and explain that these proteins are important to further investigate with regards to their function. We have used the display at public events (e.g. JHI open days) and will continue to do so in the future. Progress of our work and findings have also been presented during several company visits (e.g. Keygene, ENZA Zaden) and national and international conferences (e.g. BSPP meeting, MPMI, Keystone Symposium).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3DBACA6C-240C-4FE1-ACB7-AB68397427B3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55c1bdd2ae10e0.73045431</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During infestation, aphids secrete molecules inside their host plants that function as effectors to manipulate host cell processes. This likely involves the interaction of these effectors with host proteins to modify their activity and promote virulence. The aim of the proposed project was to investigate the functions of a select set of aphid salivary proteins, or candidate effectors, in plant-aphid interactions. More specifically we aimed to perform functional assays to 1) implicate aphid candidate effectors in plant-aphid interactions by assessing their impact on virulence, 2) localize candidate effectors inside plant cells to determine their site of activity, 3) identify host targets and 4) implicate these in plant aphid interactions.

Our main findings are that we identified several novel candidate effectors that impact aphid virulence. While doing so we also developed new assays to more extensively characterize aphid effector activity. These assays allow more extensive testing of effectors regarding their contribution to virulence. We also performed further detailed characterization studies of two aphid candidate effectors that negatively impact aphid virulence upon ove-rexpression in plants. This showed that although these proteins both negatively impact aphid virulence, they exhibit different activities to activate plant defences (Rodriguez et al, 2013, MPMI). The main part of our efforts focused on the objective to identify aphid effector host targets. We have performed 20 different protein-protein interactions screens and performed localization studies in parallel. Using these approaches we have identified a list of aphid effector-host target interactions. Based on localization studies and aphid virulence assays we have selected several interactions for further characterization and were able to show that these interactions are biologically relevant during plant aphid interactions. Interestingly, we have identified host proteins involved in different cellular processes in plant-aphid interactions. These include a host cell trafficking protein which is targeted by aphids, a host protein arginine methyltransferase and a host E3 SUMO ligase which both contribute to plant susceptibility to aphids. The identification of aphid effector host targets is a novel area of research that we believe we have developed very successfully through this grant. We currently have several publications in preparation related to this work which we believe will be a major advance in the field. Also, this work has laid an important foundation for follow-up research to further assess the contributions of specific host cellular processes to plant-aphid interactions, such as post-translational modifications and host cell trafficking.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have communicated our findings to several companies who are interested in aphid effector host targets as a potential tool for improving crop resistance to aphids. At this stage it will be important to expand our knowledge on these host targets, and the processes they are involved in to determine how they can be implemented in a successful aphid control strategy. The aim is to explore connections with industry through collaborative projects in the next year. Also, we intend to use the information we generated to apply for follow-up funding to gain a more detailed insight into the fundamental basis of aphid virulence and host susceptibility. This project has been very successful in revealing new plant proteins and processes important for aphid infestations and thereby generated a very exciting and unique opportunity to gain further insight in how aphids are able to successfully infest plants and how we may be able to interfere with this in the future. With regards to public impact, we have developed an aphid display during the project to explain our work to a general audience and will continue to use this at open days/public events.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BAC289C4-7721-4586-82E7-95A0252FA155</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55c1c4c2e448a6.27665667</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77D36BAF-599B-44F4-B5A1-BD8AA7A25662</gtr:id><gtr:title>Toward understanding the role of aphid effectors in plant infestation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3"><gtr:id>fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodriguez PA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0894-0282</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cc014c014678d3e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>83C9858C-5EC0-4497-9125-D672B4137053</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leaf-disc assay based on transient over-expression in Nicotiana benthamiana to allow functional screening of candidate effectors from aphids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3"><gtr:id>fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodriguez PA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1064-3745</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54578a12294096.66646240</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61328096-F812-4F4C-B24B-C5F55925ED7E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mp10 and Mp42 from the aphid species Myzus persicae trigger plant defenses in Nicotiana benthamiana through different activities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3"><gtr:id>fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodriguez PA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0894-0282</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54464693c67512.08266807</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF343D34-FFB6-42EB-8E00-B2170F8203AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Plant immunity in plant-aphid interactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d954c41f5132cbcb71d61973464537e9"><gtr:id>d954c41f5132cbcb71d61973464537e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jaouannet M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-462X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f94d94da9b6e89</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>052BCA34-17EC-4522-8287-3249D5E6AB0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Aphid Effector Targets Trafficking Protein VPS52 in a Host-Specific Manner to Promote Virulence.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3"><gtr:id>fd1efbc21130a85662c6865e0327dae3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodriguez PA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bfec389ab1b1.17588507</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J005258/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C640FECC-44CA-4B72-8D37-BE5E5DC0324C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interaction with organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
