To realise this potential, safety (and also the public perception of safety) is of the utmost importance, and both existing and new design nuclear power plants strive to improve safety, maintain availability and reduce the cost of operation and maintenance. Moreover, plant life extensions and power updates push the demand for the new tools for diagnosing and prognosing the health of nuclear power plants. Monitoring the status of plants by diverse means has become a norm. Current approaches for diagnosis and prognosis, which rely heavily on operator judgement on the basis of online monitoring of key variables, are not always reliable. This project will bring together three UK Universities and an Indian nuclear power plant to directly address the modelling, validation and verification changes in developing online monitoring tools for nuclear power plant. 
The project will use artificial intelligence tools, where mathematical algorithms that emulate biological intelligence are used to solve difficult modelling, decision making and classification problems. This will involve optimizing the number of inputs to the models, finding the minimum data requirement for accurate prediction of possible untoward events, and designing experiments to maximize the information content of the data. We will then use the optimised system to predict potential loss of coolant accidents and pinpoint their specific locations, after which we will progress to prediction of possible radioactive release for various accident scenarios, and, in order to facilitate emergency preparedness, the post release phase will be modelled to predict the dispersion pattern for the scenarios under consideration. Finally, all of the models will be validated, verified and integrated into a tool that can be used to monitor and act as an early warning device to prevent such scenarios from occurring.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>OpenCOSSAN is a tool for uncertainty quantification and management. It represents the core of COSSAN software under continuous development at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty,University of Liverpool, UK. All the algorithms and methods have been coded in a Matlab toolbox allowing numerical analysis, reliability analysis, simulation, sensitivity, optimization, robust design. 

OpenCossan is coded exploiting the object-oriented Matlab programming environment, where it is possible to define specialized solution sequences, which include reliability methods, sensitivity analysis, optimization strategies, surrogate models and parallel computing strategies. The computational framework is organized in packages. A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner, which makes large software project OpenCossan easier to manage. A class describes a set of objects with common characteristics such as data structures and methods. Objects, that are instances of classes can be aggregated forming more complex objects and proving solutions for practical problem in a compact, organized and manageable format. The structure of the software allows for extensive modularity and efficient code re-utilization. Objects (instances of a class) can be aggregated forming more complex objects with methods providing solutions for practical problem in a compact, organized and manageable format.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C874012A-F1FF-4FF8-87CA-73B6EDB07E94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bayesian Belief Networks, more commonly known as Bayesian Networks, are a probabilistic graphical model based on the use of directed acyclic graphs, integrating graph theory with the robustness of Bayesian statistics. The graphical framework of such models consists of nodes, representing the variables of the problem of interest, connected to each other by edges, generally arrows, that depict the dependency link existing between two nodes. 
The main aim of the Bayesian Network approach is to factorize the probability of a complex event exploiting the knowledge regarding the dependencies existing among its sub-parts. In order to overcome the limitations associated with traditional Bayesian Networks, the integration of such approach with the imprecise probability theory has attracted increasing attention in the scientific community leading to the formulation and study of Credal Networks.

Further efforts and research are strongly required in order to enhance the attractivness of Credal Networks outside the academic world and to ensure the reliability and efficiency of their performance in real-world applications. These aims represent the core of the Credal Networks toolbox developed within the OpenCossan framework: well known and novel methodologies are integrated in the software in order to provide the implementation, manipulation and analysis of Credal Networks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd955e4c1300.64956968</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Toolboox for OpenCossan</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cossan.co.uk/software/open-cossan-engine.php</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4E68330-131A-4132-B48C-A07463961327</gtr:id><gtr:title>Uncertainty quantification methods for neural networks pattern recognition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8585df02a77b3e78b6c34bc6d9752ead"><gtr:id>8585df02a77b3e78b6c34bc6d9752ead</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tolo S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa13d3d686969.46409685</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17AF0DBB-6ED8-464A-96BA-21AEBD66C50A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robust artificial neural network for reliability and sensitivity analyses of complex non-linear systems.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/06f31212bac6e0087942b653b950c200"><gtr:id>06f31212bac6e0087942b653b950c200</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oparaji U</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0893-6080</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6994939f7e7.88657504</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M018415/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0FE8D416-B45D-49A3-928D-3B94E03E72DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Nuclear</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
