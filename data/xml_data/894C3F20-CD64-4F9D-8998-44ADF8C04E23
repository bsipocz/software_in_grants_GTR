However, long-term impacts of the 'experiment' we are currently carrying out with our planet earth are poorly understood. Approximately three million years ago, during the Pliocene warm period, temperatures were elevated over modern levels and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were similar to today. This past era could present clues to future climate change and a key response we would like to understand is how ocean circulation will function in a warmer world. Today, surface waters in the North Atlantic become denser than the surrounding water and sink to the ocean's interior forming a deep-water mass as part of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation plays a major role in global climate and climate/weather in the United Kingdom. The North Pacific on the other hand is too fresh, and hence no deep waters are formed there today. The configuration of deep ocean circulation during the Pliocene is unclear: some fossil evidence suggests that Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was strong, whereas climate models suggest Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was weak and a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation occurred in the North Pacific. This disagreement has profound implications for heat transport and the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the oceans. To address this data-model mismatch, this project aims to reconstruct intermediate and deep-water circulation in the Atlantic and Pacific during the Pliocene warm period using the chemistry of microfossils found within marine sediment. These records will then be compared to state of the art climate models for the Pliocene to help understand the climate dynamics important in maintaining Pliocene warmth. These records will help characterize heat transport, carbon cycling and intermediate to deep ocean circulation during a globally warm climate state and may help identify some of the long-term consequences of global warming.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the immediate Pliocene research group there are several beneficiaries envisioned. Primarily, this work is pertinent to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)[Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013] because the Pliocene is a target interval for palaeo-perspectives on future climate change. The Pliocene is the most recent period of sustained warmth with carbon dioxide levels similar to today. Therefore, the Pliocene provides the scientific community an opportunity to study the patterns and processes important during a globally warm climate state. 

Future global warming will have a variety of cascading social and economical impacts. Using the Pliocene as a possible benchmark to help constrain climate models will aid in identifying climate changes and high-risk areas. Having a clear picture of future global warming will aid nations in mitigating the impacts of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces a synthesis report approximately every five years and data relevant to the Pliocene, including this proposed dataset, will likely contribute to the palaeo-perspectives on future climate change in the ~2020 and ~2025 IPCC installments. 

Within the United Kingdom, understanding the equilibrium state of Atlantic Ocean circulation during a warm climate like the Pliocene will help climate and weather models forecast and mitigate climate changes due to global warming. The Atlantic-arm of surface and deep ocean circulation (Atlantic Overturning Ocean Circulation) has an enormous influence on United Kingdom climate and weather. This research may help improve climate/weather models forecasting ability.

Personally, as a female early career researcher, I would immensely benefit from the research fellowship. I would gain valuable research experience at one of the most esteemed universities in the world and widen my international professional network. Obtaining this fellowship would make me well-poised to obtain a academic position and build a research group interested in tackling palaeoclimate questions relevant to predicting future climate change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>507224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N015045/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
