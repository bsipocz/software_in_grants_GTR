Our proposal to develop IP based on EPSRC-funded research at Exeter will be driven by an experienced entrepreneur employed to drive market-facing research, develop business plans and secure funding for three spin-out companies. The entrepreneur will be appointed by the lead parties (the University and QinetiQ), will report to a KTA Delivery Board and hold a budget dedicated to meeting business-driven requirements for successful exploitation of the existing IP, i.e. preparation of business plans, market technology status, proof-of-principle demonstrations, rental of incubator space, risk mitigation to bridge the gap to large scale-investment and introduction to investment providers. Effective research exploitation ultimately requires commercial success. If true market demand and/or requirements can be identified, specific problems can be solved, however new technologies and solutions will only reach the market if they can be properly demonstrated to customers, manufacturers, and supply chain partners alike. One of the most significant obstacles to meaningful exploitation of new technologies is the lack of a suitable demonstrator and a clearly articulated development and exploitation plan: without these, potential investors cannot visualise clearly what is on offer and how they will be able to contribute which, in the case of early stage technologies of the type created by University funding, leads to greatly increased perceived risk. Hence, the aim of this KTA is to bring technical solutions to prototype, tailored to the markets needs, and therefore to create compelling offerings for industry. The 3.480M KTA investment requested could show a return of ~15M investment in three spin-out companies creating jobs and expenditure over the three year period.An example may help illustrate the idea. QinetiQ helped facilitate the setting up of a new company, Omni-ID, to exploit IP in the area of Radio Frequency tagging of goods and products. Traditionally radio frequency tagging was difficult to accomplish for metallic products such as computers, where the reflectivity of metals in such products at radio frequencies causes interference and jeopardises the performance of the tags. The new technology, based on a new structured material, manipulates the radio waves in such a way as to overcome interference caused by reflections from the metal components. This new approach has enabled a paradigm shift in the area of RF-tagging (used for asset tracking, supply chain management) and is an example of how tailoring the electromagnetic properties of materials through smart design can lead to new technologies and new opportunities. 2911 ch.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3238795</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H50012X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
