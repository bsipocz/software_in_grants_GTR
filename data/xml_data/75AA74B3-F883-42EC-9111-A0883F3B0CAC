However, large scale processes using these organisms are hamstrung by the requirement to use natural light which although it is free is unpredictable in intensity, quality and periodicity being dependent weather conditions. Natural light also restricts potential photobioreactor (PBR) geometries, raceways and tubular PBR's making large scale operation problematic, unreliable reducing the productivity of these systems. Internally lit PBR's could revolutionise these with the intensive production of high quality, high value algae and open up the field to exploitation using the tools of synthetic biology to develop the safe productive capacity these systems. 

The project therefore aims to investigate internally lit PBR's. This is multidisciplinary collaboration of biologists, physicists and engineers. We will design, construct and test internally lit PBRs have substantially higher productivity and capability over conventionally natural lit systems. On the face on it, the investment and cost of internally lit PBR's are much higher than natural lit systems, however, this can more than compensated by the potential advantages and benefits of growing and manipulating algae in highly controlled lighting environments. This includes more efficient use of light that is provided by LED's which has narrow spectra and easily controlled intensity reducing the cost of production. The sophisticated use of LED lighting also offers up exciting opportunities to control and monitor biochemical composition and product formation much of which is influenced by the quality and intensity of light. With internal lighting reactors can also be scaled in three dimensions and are independent of natural light. Reactors can be tailored and optimised for different products and simplified the strategies for the development of genetically engineered algae can be safely implemented. 

The project will focus on the testing of novel flexible PBR design to realise the potential of this approach. The work consists of 5 work packages (i) The development of new methods of selection and use of LED's. (ii) The development of lighting plates where LED's will be mounted internally of light weight lighting plates within the reactor that also facilitating good heat and mass transfer. Lighting control systems will also be developed to minimise energy consumption while allowing efficient growth and product formation of algae. (iii) The PBR systems will be designed an operated at 1 m3 scale which will be sufficient scale to allow easy scale of these systems (iv) The reactor will constructed, commission and characterised. (v) These internally lit PBR concepts will be centred on high value product formation and will be tested and evaluated with Heamotoccus pluvalis for the production of cells and astaxanthin.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The markets for Algae are growing and the demand for algal is rapidly developing in the UK and Europe. There are already some well-developed sectors using specialised products such as fish feed for marine fish hatcheries. While the food, feed, cosmetic and health sectors are looking to algae to make innovative sustainable products. There are many potential applications for light manipulation in aquaculture. This potential will be well served by internally lit PBR providing the reliable production of high quality algae and their products. Internally lit PBR can be applied at many levels not only as production unit itself but also integrated into grow out in low intensity raceway systems as an inoculant stage.
Within the current and planned future projects run by CSAR and CCFP we are well-positioned to develop the impact of the project. We are well connected internationally and have extensive collaboration networks of academics and industry in the UK and Europe. We (KJF, RWL) are part of the proposed BBSRC IB network initiative in algae biotechnology. We will disseminate this work through these established networks and refereed publications, after patent protection.

We lead the EnAlgea project (&amp;pound;14m, Energetic Algae, Dr Robin Shields (PI)) on behalf of INTEREG NW Europe who commissioned project to investigate and promote the use of algae in energy and related industries. Its main aims are to coordinate a series of pilot plants, identify barriers to algae development (both scientific and commercial) and develop a decision making tool to assess the potential for use of large scale algae processes and processing. This has over 20 partners (academic, industry, regional governments, trade associations and European regulatory bodies) and a further 10 official observers. This high profile project will run through the duration of the current project and its activities will be synergistic with this project. We will disseminate our results through Enalgae activities. 

We (RL (CI) and KJF (CI) together with Dr Robin Shields (PI)) also run the Knowledge Transfer Centre (KTC) for Algal Biotechnology, a Welsh Government financed initiative to develop and support advise industry in Wales and beyond. This will be used to developed and extend the use of internally lit PBR. The KTC has an excellent track record in successfully generating grants and projects with local industry to utilisation algae in waste remediation included digester wastes and flue gas utilisation, supply trial materials for feeds, and for natural product discovery. Most notable is the ACCOMPLISH project investigating the potential for algae growth on wastes and low value coke oven gases. In past 3 years, the academics and the 3 staff employed on the project have assisted 130 enterprises within the UK. We have organised and given 6 seminars, undertaken 17 collaborative R and D projects and set up 4 studentships. 6 product or processes have been developed including 1 patent, &amp;pound;400k investment has been induced and &amp;pound;3m funding secured mainly associated with European projects, EPSRC funded project Macrobiocrude (&amp;lt;&amp;pound;2m) and the Welsh government (ACCOMPLISH 600k). We have set up a new University spin-out Cambrian Phycosystems to be established to exploit algal production technology. The focus of this company is mainly on Reactors, lighting systems and downstream processing for algae production. The pathway to manufacture of the reactors will be through Cambrian Phycosystems. The KTC has just received renewed funding For the KTC concentrating on PBR design, lighting systems, process and ecological modelling and high value products. 

We have 1 UK patent pending (GB2482083) lighting within PBR and are actively seeking further patents in the field of control of lighting within PBR with our University Research and Innovation Department. It is anticipated that these patents will be exploited through the spin out Cambrian Physcosystems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Mexico, United Mexican States</gtr:country><gtr:description>Phycopigments</gtr:description><gtr:id>3D3E99F0-9A19-4A14-A1CB-ECE53330C12C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c695f845cb08.36404280-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partnership involves two institution (ENECOL) and Tech de Monterrey and a small spinout company (Galtech) in Mexico, where safe food grade are required for inclusion into food, pharma and cosmetic materials, They have proven track records in culturing micro-algae and have facilities for large scale cultivation of microalgae (Spirrulina and Porphorydium).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>WE are working with two institutions and a spin out company in Mexico on high value pigment production from microalgae.

This is rapidly developing field where a promising commercial landscape has emerged during the project. The project involved two main areas of work: (1). The design, development and operation of a 1000L photobioreactor which was internally lit with RGB LED's; and, (2). The investigation of growth microalgae in LED RGB light culture systems including the 1000L PBR. 
This project has contributed to our expertise in this areas and we plan to publish at least 3 scientific papers and a review from the results obtained. 
The findings of the project demonstrated that the design was capable of growing a range of microalgae in which the lighting conditions were precisely controlled and that this had several advantages that can be exploited commercially. For example, under specific lighting conditions using restricted wavelengths of LED's, the composition of the microalgae can be changed substantially providing novel strategies for high value product formation. E.g. phycoerythrin production by Porphrydium purpureum. Using these research findings we have applied (Feb 2016) for Newton Mexico funds( &amp;pound;1.05m Innovate UK) developing novel production technologies for light induction microalgal pigments together with Membranology (University Spinout) and ENECOL, Tech de Monterrey and ALTESO (University Spinout) in Mexico where clean food and feed production are a priority. A key object will be to develop patents for enhanced product formation in microalgae focussing on high value compounds. e.g. Food grade pigments (phycocyanin and phycoerythrin) that have substantial value as natural food colouring agents that are recognised by FDA as natural safe food additives. In addition they have important uses in immunodiagnostics when highly purified. The proposed project will be to develop the production processes to TRL 7, making a full assessment of its economic, environmental and social sustainability and associated impacts. We have also been developing industrial contacts and colaborations with companies involved in microalgae production and processing. Aragreen Ltd and Varacon Aqua have interested in microalgae production using artificially lighting for pigment production and associated reactors equipment.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>177217B0-42D7-43B4-A8B6-4522E78E6D31</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb1f40be03a3.58803687</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project involved two main areas of work: (1). The design, development and operation of a 1000L photobioreactor which was internally lit with RGB LED's; and, (2). The investigation of growth microalgae in LED RGB light culture systems including the 1000L PBR.
Interactions of microalgae with light are complex, this is not surprising when considering the variations and dynamics associated with light in the natural environment where the quality of light and intensity are highly variable (i.e. movement up and down the water column, weather conditions and diurnal effects). For microalgae rapid responses to changing lighting conditions is matter of survival as light is the primary sources of energy for growth. This would include light periodicity, spectrum shifts with depth etc. 
Using a number of important microalgae Heamatococcus pluvalis, Porphorydium purpureum and Nanochloropsis we investigated the grown and responses to RGB lighting. Experiments with Heamotoccus were problematic and we were unable to products astathaxin using LED RGB lighting and studies with this organism were abandoned. This was attributed to the complex life of this organism and the induction and transition between various stages of is growth cycle (green/red pigment formation). With Porphrydium purpureum, we were able to grow the organism under a range of conditions and were able to show that the compositions could be manipulated with narrow wavelength light. E.g. the proteins content could be increase by 20 to 50% over controls. The specific concentrations of pigment could be enhanced by combinations of red/blue light or green light &amp;lt;20% increases over controls. In addition the cultures once adapted proved to be robust to contamination. This is major finding as it provides novel induction/production strategies for high value product formation in microalgae. Although pigment induction has previously been shown to be dependent on light quality and intensity, this is first time it has been used on large scale using LED RGB lighting.
A major aim of the project was to construct an internally lit photobioreactor (ILPBR). The physical design of the reactor is sound, giving good mixing and good heat mass transfer in relative low shear environment powered by gas bubbles. The equipment consisted of a modified 1000L IBC container with it top removed to allow the fitting of a metal lid through which a stainless s steel frame containing the lighting plate system, heat exchanger and gassing systems were added .
Once constructed the reactor was characterised for its mixing and heat transfer characteristics. Good agitation and mixing was obtained by aerating between alternating plates to create strong flow patterns within the reactor. Mixing time of less than 2 minutes could be obtained at 80 L/m gassing or 0.08 vol/vol/min. Under these conditions is was found that the temperature could easily be controlled by a cold water circuit through the stainless steel serpentine at the base of the reactor. This was a low shear well mixed environment capable of growing a wide range of organisms. The reactor has been use to grow two organisms Nannochloropsis and Porphyridium successfully and these studies are still ongoing and typically take 14 to 20 days depending on the organism and inoculum quality. We have reached cell densities of about 2 g/L which is as good as most PBR systems and substantial better than race culture systems. Cells growth as fast if not faster that then natural light and that this is more reproducible. We are still analysing our data from the experiments carried out so far with respect to chemical composition and photosynthetic efficiency.
These results show that the interaction of light with the microalgea, is complex and species specific. Good growth and product formation has been observed with the Porphrydium and Nanochloropsis. The optimisation of lighting system for high value product formation will required more work to clarify the best lighting control strategies for growth and product formation and assessing these effects on production costs. The work on bioreactor design now requires more focus on light plate design and an investigation of alternative technologies associated with lighting systems i.e light diffuser technology. This is critical to the performances of the bioreactor, its operability and flexibility of operation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of promising outcomes of the research. 
(1) The interaction of light with microalgae is complex and needs to be explored further as to its precise role in controlling product formation and environmental adaptation. This is both of fundamental and applied significance. 
(2) Results suggest a possible novel route to enhance product formation using specific frequencies of light to increase the concentration of important products such as pigments, fatty acid and proteins. This can be exploited in industrial production systems increasing the value of the biomass and reducing process costs for production and recovery of materials.
(3) Internally lit photobioreactors (ILPBR) overcome many of the design constraints of naturally lit systems bring cultivation of phototrophic algae on the similar footing as tradition heterotrophic microbes so enhancing utility and potential of exploiting the great diversity of microalgae for production. 
(4) ILPBR can be used to grow algae on a large scale, although in its infancy, this approach allows the production of high value components in highly controlled conditions needed for the high quality production systems for pharmaceutical/nutraceutical compounds. There is considerable scope for improvements by incorporating lighting control systems and using better materials of construction. ILPBR are the obvious approach to large scale GM algal production systems that are now emerging.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FB139EBB-58F3-4A67-AE80-D3F4E0FD49E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bb1ec303edc7.01002524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed and used FTIR for rapid analysis of cell contents of algae (astaxantin)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D123042B-7277-489F-8FCD-4C8CEAA1638A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>rapid on line assessment to promote effective harvest time for cultures</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a1afe663b2.67934090</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>FTIR dection of microalgal products</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>WE have developed a pilot scale Internally Lit Photobioreactor (ILPBR) for growing industrially important algae.</gtr:description><gtr:id>056ED3F6-B5F4-48EE-8D3F-07D985150174</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enabled the assessment of algae in LED RGB lighting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99cd4267099.36270367</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Internally lit PBR</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>membranology</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Membranology is a spin out company whose aim is to exploit our world class knowledge in membrane technology and associated processing this includes algal bioprocessing and separation and purification of algal products developed in this project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1D5159D-449B-4939-BF31-B218692A6353</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Additional expertise, potential development of intellectual property, involvement in commercial projects related to algal production technology</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d991f7701b87.07409805</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2012</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4B60548-C622-47A1-8507-856B59B0A1D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Utilising light-emitting diodes of specific narrow wavelengths for the optimization and co-production of multiple high-value compounds in Porphyridium purpureum.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bioresource technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e774a1e8ee22eb21284500a5cf19d2ff"><gtr:id>e774a1e8ee22eb21284500a5cf19d2ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coward T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-8524</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c68c602e2497.85890415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L022389/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>21CE2EA6-E7A2-4406-A045-0DA7CA19B695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Control Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
