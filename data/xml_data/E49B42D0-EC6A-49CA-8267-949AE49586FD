This reflects not just a niche area of media technology - but, if interest in wearable technology is anything to go by, we are heading towards a society where life is truly mediated. Empathic media refers to the capacity for new media technologies to sense, interpret and act on the emotional states of people, and to make use of people's intentions and expressions in generating textual and personalised media experiences. Cues perceived by what I term 'empathic media' include physiological change (eg pupil dilation, pulse, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature or respiration), electrodermal responses, pheromones, galvanic skin response (eg sweat), facial/body expressions, voice inflection and sound (potentially beyond human range). In each case, empathic media involve systems that monitor our behaviour by means of bodily movement and outputs, engaging with people in a personalised capacity, and doing this by means of tailored textual experiences.

Empathic media are the next step in behavioural media, or those tracking practices associated with some of the world's largest online media companies, such as Google and Facebook, whose business models depend on tracking and making sense of our mediated activities. Empathic media include, for instance, Microsoft's Xbox via Kinect (a plug-in device that visually detects motion) that scans the content of rooms in which they are placed and monitors biometric responses to advertising. Not alone, Sony and Verizon have developed very similar televisual feedback systems. Other empathic media on the horizon include Google Glass (augmented reality glasses); networked wrist watches with tracking and bio-sensors; networked clothing and handbags (with global positioning applications); baby clothes able to soothe babies; and garments able to monitor bodily data for purposes ranging from health awareness and self-regulation to comparing sporting performance with others. Whether used for more precisely targeted advertising, or by individuals to better look after their own health, each form of empathic media involves the ability to sense what is significant for people, and make use of both their expressions and intentions, so acting on their emotional states. 

To study empathic media in greater depth, I seek knowledge exchange by means of semi-structured interviews (conversations with a purpose) with 20+ start-up and established organisations in the US and UK. This comprises companies involved in producing empathic media; advertising agencies seeking to make use of new creative, interactive and data-oriented opportunities generated from empathic media; regulators in Europe and the UK tasked with managing these technologies; and NGOs concerned about privacy. Importantly, through detailed case study analysis of a range of empathic media, I will assess: (a) the 'affordances' of the technologies themselves (ie what properties they possess and what they enable users, and companies, to do); and (b) the political-economic, social and legal issues that these media technologies raise.

Outputs will include one monograph on empathic media that theorises them in relation to existing behavioural practices, explores philosophical implications in regard to whether they can &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; know us, and assesses the adequacy of existing privacy laws and norms. Later outputs entail: two empirical journal papers in world-leading journals that advance theory and understanding in light of interviews conducted; three conference papers at major international Media conferences; three reports targeted by sector (industry, regulation and NGOs) and meetings with end-users to deliver these; key findings placed online; public talks and social media engagement; already agreed mass media appearances on BBC radio; and a journalistic article for The Conversation, an RC-UK/Guardian journalism project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Sector-specific impacts are envisaged across industry, regulators, NGOs and the public. I seek to affect organisations by raising awareness of other stakeholders' perspectives and by highlighting the social implications of empathic media (good and bad). 

Sector-specific impacts include:
- Industry. By identifying empathic media as an identifiable 'assemblage', the research will raise advertising agency awareness of the potential for privacy-friendly, and opt-in, interactive empathic advertising. This will enhance creative and economic competitiveness of UK advertising agencies to which research will be delivered personally (other agencies can access the research online). 
- Regulators. This research will help regulators and those responsible for managing data processing/privacy processes understand this emergent suite of media that make use of biometrics, wearable technology, and more granular ways of reading and understanding people. These represent a significant challenge to regulators. Eg, empathic media raise philosophical implications for subjectivity, with practical importance for identifying who the user actually is in privacy legislation on data processing. This research seeks to diagnose and clarify the properties of empathic media, and their regulatory implications. Impact will comprise more informed policy-making at Welsh, UK and European levels regarding emergent empathic media forms.
- NGOs. These play a key civic function in monitoring industry and pressuring legislators. Impact will arise from offering clear diagnosis of this novel suite of media, and what uses they enable. Knowledge can be used to enhance accuracy and persuasiveness of NGO campaign strategies where processes are deemed privacy-invasive. Gleaning and sharing (where ethically possible) the perspectives of other key actors in industry and regulatory sectors will enable NGOs to better understand perspectives and pressures of regulators and industry actors.
- The public. The public will be offered knowledge of empathic media developments alongside their pros and cons; the perspectives of key actors identified above; and an understanding of who they should complain to if unhappy and how they can get involved with NGOs campaigning on privacy matters. As such, the public will be empowered to make better-informed decisions regarding their use of empathic media.

These impacts will arise through knowledge-exchange activities, starting with interviews with 20+ organisations across industry, regulators and NGOs. Insights developed from these interviews and case study research will be distilled into three sector-targeted Key Findings reports. Building on productive relationships developed through interviews, these Key Findings will be disseminated to relevant industry (media and technology companies/advertising businesses), regulatory organisations (European Commission, UK and Wales Information Commissioner's Offices) and NGOs involved with campaigning on privacy matters [Open Rights Group and Big Brother Watch]). These Key Findings reports (each 3000 words) will be targeted by sector and stakeholder requirements. With different degrees of emphasis depending on sector, this will include an overview of the nature and constituents of empathic media, and the perspectives of other stakeholders on key issues (such as consequences of empathic media for privacy norms, for creative opportunities in advertising, for NGO campaigning, and for legislation/regulation). Where feasible, Key Findings will also be delivered in person to stakeholders interviewed to enable clarifications, to maintain dialogue, and to cement ongoing working relations.
The public will be engaged through public talks (also web-cast) at Bangor University, social media postings (eg on my own Twitter account), mass media appearances (BBC, The Conversation) and online hosting of all Key Findings (on University research pages, University social media outlets and my own personal pages).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>133374</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Along with Ronan Devlin (lead artists), Vian Bakir, Gillian Jein and Carwyn Edwards I co-created a new interactive artwork that visualises information generated by our networked devices.

In 2016 I ran a workshop at Digital Catapult. Part of my AHRC programme of work on empathic media, this brought together leading companies in the emotion detection industry in the UK (such as IBM, Sensum and CrowdEmotion), data protection authorities (the Information Commissioner's Office), media regulators (Committee of Advertising Practice), technologists and select academics. The aim was to generate a code of ethics that is workable for the industry, yet satisfies citizens. The importance of this work lies in the fact that we have a clear lacuna in European data protection legislation (that I identified in discussion with data protection authorities from the European Commission). This creates urgent need for an ethical approach to these technologies because these technologies are arriving quickly, yet we do not have regulatory structures in place to deal with technologies that engage people at the most intimate of levels. The code was published by Digital Catapult in short form, along with the extended report that details its genesis.

This may seem a small issue, but technology and marketing industries are building products based on this premise, i.e. data protection laws do not apply if a person cannot be identified - even if the data is clear sensitive (about the body and emotions). With this lacuna in mind, I sought to engage industries and co-create an ethical code of conduct in this area. This is not policy change per se, because at this stage this is not feasible. The very basics of European data protection law (along with forthcoming regulations GDPR/e-Privacy in Europe) are utterly based on being able to identify people and devices. Although I maintain relationships with policy makers in Brussels (at DG Connect) it would have been fruitless to attempt change of this magnitude. Where influence is possible (and has been achieved in part) is how companies and industry self-regulators use this data. My idea was to develop ethical frameworks with industry and their self-regulators. The success of this is most clearly evident from the workshop help at Digital Catapult, London (see https://pdtn.org/emotional-ai-dos-donts/). Here the industry and self-regulators developed &amp;quot;dos and don'ts&amp;quot; for this class of data. Other delegates included advertising self-regulators and technology giants including IBM. These conversations are ongoing, but each delegate reported that findings would influence their internal decision-making. Findings and co-created suggestions were simple but significant. (Nb.

This has been established through 100+ interviews with leading technologists, companies, policy makers and intelligence agencies. Although data protection exists where this class of analytics is able to identify a person, many of these technologies are able to make use of a person's emotions without identifying them (for example by recording smiles or facial surprise without actually using data that could identify a person). This raises ethical questions about intimacy and privacy, that is: is OK to collect and use data without consent that is intimate (about the body and emotional life) but not legally personally (identifiable). Much of the research has entailed understanding legal dimensions of this question and what industrialists and surveillance organisations think about this. The applications are diverse, including emotion detection in the workplace, public spaces, domestic spaces and through personal media. I established clear workable guidelines and have also made legal recommendations. This is based on the fact that while forthcoming legislation on data protection cannot be changed, there is scope for local national level additions and strengthening. However, while national-level scope for legal is possible and should be executed (and I interact with UK data protection authorities about this), practical conditions suggest an approach of a more self-regulatory form (i.e. co-creation of ethical guidelines). This is imperfect, not least because in this form there is no scope for punitive measures if guidelines are broken, but this approach has generated an industry conversation about the issue. This is evidenced by workshops, requests to speak and invitations to advisory boards for organisations developing these products.

In regard to what citizens actually think about this, I found that:
 - the majority of people (50%) in the UK are not OK with having their emotions tracked by a range of media companies (social media, advertising, games, film and voice analytics); 
 - a smaller proportion are OK with having emotions tracked if not personally identifiable (33%);
 - some people are happy even if they are identified (8%)
 - and some do not know (9%)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Policy: reliable evidence of public perception of emotion tracking, tangible legal suggestions (national level) and emerging self-regulatory codes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>873ADADA-20FD-43DD-834C-D4460940A67F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56af74bf429b62.55839022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Information Commissioner's Office</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64561744-7AA5-46AB-9941-A52C6F38D1F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Iain Bourne, (Head of Policy Delivery, ICO) and Simon Rice (Group Manager of Technology, ICO) at the UK's Information Commissioner's Office are interested in the big picture outcome of this AHRC funded research (where emotional data is not strictly personal [and hence subject to stricter regulations] but intimate]), but also the detail (such as implications for laws and regulations on data processing).
