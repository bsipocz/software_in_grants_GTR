Proposal</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P006698/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Remembering, just like forgetting, is always a political act. The First World War was a global conflict which left its mark on the local. Was it experienced differently in urban and rural areas? What were the relationships between soldiers and civilians during and after the war? Did it shape individual and community identities? Did it have different meanings for contemporaries? There was a consensus that the dead were to be commemorated and remembered, but there was less agreement over how the example of sacrifice was to be understood and the meanings to be attributed to and experiences to be drawn from acts of commemoration. How have these meanings changed over time? How is it being understood today? Is it a truism that 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'? Certainly, Britain in 2016 is a very different country to that of 1914 and has been described by Parekh (2000) as 'a community of communities.' What sense are young people making of the local memorials to the dead which sit in the urban and rural landscapes and the acts of commemoration organised by an older generation which centre upon them? What meaning does the war have for young people who have grown up in a society where live reports of conflict are instantly available on a smartphone and where stories of casualties, destruction and refugees are instantly reported in the media? How will young people connect this past with their present and their future? As the First World War moves out of memory into history, what will be the record of commemoration that they will have experienced and will be left after 2019 for future historians to reflect upon? The issues embedded in these questions formed, and continue to form, the framework of the Voices of War and Peace: the Great War and its Legacy project. Committed to cross-disciplinary research, structural commitment to community engagement with research and professional commitment 'in a mission of understanding' to investigate, analyse, apprehend, criticize and judge and thereby translate Edward Said's idea of 'communities of interpretation' into practice (Said 2003) the Voices' Centre has reached out to multiple communities and publics, local and national, to explore through dialogue issues around memory, remembering and commemoration. The Centre exists to respond to community requests for support in terms of building research skills and in supporting community driven research agenda; and it exists to work in partnership with the other AHRC funded Engagement Centres, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Centenary Partnership, and arts and heritage organisations in exploring the connections between public and academic histories of the First World War. Sharing knowledge, expertise and resources about the impact of conflict on gender relations on the home front during and after the war, on the spiritual elements of personal and family identity, on family relationships and what it was to be a child growing up in an age of conflict, loss and displacement, and on global relationships in the decades that followed the Peace the Voices project will leave its own legacy for community/academy relations in terms of the capacity for the co-design and coproduction of research, an understanding of the complicated relationship between remembering and forgetting and a desire to continue to 'think forward through the past'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many groups can be identified that will benefit from the Voices of War and Peace project. The most direct beneficiaries will be the partner organisations who have agreed to collaborate. These organisations will benefit from their staff being involved in working across the academy/cultural sector divide and gaining insights into the research culture to be found in the university sector. None of the partners currently have the capacity to be identified as independent research organisations but involvement in the project will support the development of a research culture especially through the engagement of those participants in Birmingham University Cultural Partnership Honorary Research Fellow and Associate scheme. Partner organisations will also have gained increased understanding of the needs, interests and knowledge of communities be they local, regional or virtual and also insights into the community research agendas of the AHRC.

A second, but as yet difficult to quantify, group of benificiaries will be the various communities who will have engaged in dialogue with the researchers in the network and in collaborative research. At the heart of the AHRC/HLF initiative around the commemoration of the First World War is a capacity building agenda. Active engagement in researching community history projects will have been supported by the research network through the sharing of expertise, whether content or process, through workshops or collaborative research. Relationships are at the core of the quality of life in geographically defined communities and active engagement in participatory and inclusive community history projects can strengthen the resilience of communities and the sense of belonging. The dialogue between communities and researchers around the commemoration of the First World War will have focused on sensitive issues around what is remembered and what is forgotten and will have drawn attention to different interpretations of the past. The ideas of 'community' and 'collective memory' are embedded in these interpretations and reflecting on how the past is made accessible in the present will have the potential to enable individuals and communities to understand how they are positioned in relation to the past.

A third group of beneficiaries will be those members of the research network, including Early Career Researchers, who have little or no experience of working with communities on heritage related projects as the Centre will organise training and workshops on undertaking public engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>582316</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E8EAFA6-4D27-452B-BBA8-574E58AF1463</gtr:id><gtr:title>A History of Women in 100 Objects</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bfc075a868db2ecfe86385e7af81a413"><gtr:id>bfc075a868db2ecfe86385e7af81a413</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andrews Maggie</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0750967145</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d5657513ed4.55897373</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08614ECF-4FCE-447F-B41F-1F24EA7F84FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>101 Things You Need to Know About Suffragettes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c361e459809c8a7fd584b7b8500a74c"><gtr:id>8c361e459809c8a7fd584b7b8500a74c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andrews Professor Maggie</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0750988843</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d56a7574521.91232306</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D62370CD-801A-4403-9CB6-2C47E13D7D0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Flanders and Helmand: chaplaincy, faith and religious change in the British Army, 1914-2014</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Beliefs &amp; Values</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff3d315e57c9ddb7559f4932c62ee4fd"><gtr:id>ff3d315e57c9ddb7559f4932c62ee4fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snape M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc445a52a70.28097138</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F651C73C-B32D-4615-8F1A-40DF70E274F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;The Bible is the Word of God.
