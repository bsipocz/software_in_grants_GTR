But although we now know their DNA sequences, we still know almost nothing about how that DNA is folded in 3-D space within the nucleus of a living cell. Common sense suggests there must be some underlying order within the apparent tangle. As a result, the relation of the 3-D dynamic architecture with function - the storage and expression of genetic information - remains one of the central unresolved issues of our time. It has become clear that genomes are tremendous coevolutionary and interwoven molecular storage machines able to manipulate and fabricate information: the genetic information is coded in and along these long molecules, and these molecules are continually being modified spatially and temporally through a multi-dimensional interaction and regulatory network. Therefore, a full understanding of structure-function relationships requires knowledge not only of the linear base-pair composition, but also of its structural and dynamic organization. The human genome encodes information on several levels: i) the famous DNA double helix, ii) which winds around a protein complex (the nucleosome), iii) and condenses into a higher-order 'chromatin' fiber, iv) that is folded into loops, v) which aggregate in turn into chromosomal subdomains, vi) that form 'territories', vii) which are arranged in a complex way in the nucleus. Modifications acting as a code and affecting function are found at all these levels. Therefore, in 'EpiGenSys' we have established an unique consortium of European scientists with the aim of achieving a major breakthrough in the determination and understanding of the relation between DNA sequence, the 3-D folding, and the way the system is able to access and read ('transcribe') the information. Using a truly inter-disciplinary approach, we plan to integrate the following set of projects: i) The investigation of the dynamic structure locally at the level of the nucleosome and globally at the level of the fiber. ii) The determination of intra/inter chromosomal interactions and the organization of territories. iii) The analysis of the genetic readouts - the transcriptional states - and their relation to the underlying structure. iv) The simulation (using super-computers) of the structure at the level of nucleosomes, fibers, and whole chromosomes to provide theoretical insight. v) The integration of i) to iv) into a mathematical model of the whole system that will be accessed using a special web browser that will facilitate the viewing (and manipulation) of all the different kinds of data. We expect through reiterative cycling between experiment and theory that we will be able to address a central issue of the genomic era - the way structure influences gene activity (and vice versa). Projects i) through iii) involve (wet) experimental science (cell and molecular biology), while projects iv) and v) utilize computers and mathematical modelling (and so involve mathematicians, physicists, and bioinformaticians) . PR Cook will be involved in projects ii), iii) and iv), and so will work on both sides of the cultural divide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our genetic information is stored in the base sequence encoded by our DNA, and the DNA molecules that run the length of each human chromosome are arguably the longest and most important biomolecules known.

We believe that 'EpiGenSys' will create a virtual lab that will help us to solve one of the central challenges of our age - the relationship between the structure and (epigenetic) function of genomes (and the human genome in particular). We will apply an unique approach integrating advanced highthroughput/high-performance technologies in cell biology, mathematics, physics and informatics to enhance our understanding of this key biological issue. 'EpiGenSys' is a true systems approach that will be applied to determine how the activities of genes in certain cells are connected to the organization (and vice versa) and how these are connected in turn to the many serious diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart disease) that are known to result from derangements in transcriptional control and epigenetic programming. Therefore we anticipate that beneficiaries will include a wide range - from scientists working in universities, through commercial enterprises who capitalize on our intellectual property, to society at large. How will they benefit from this research? 'EpiGenSys' should lead to interdisciplinary scientific publications and additional collaborations beyond those found in the consortium (estimate: ~15 publications, ~20-40 academic collaborations). Each of the technologies to be used (and their future developments), plus the synergies that might arise from their combined use, have potential for commercialization due to their uniqueness, novelty, and frontier position (e.g., concerning academic, diagnostic and commercial aspects). We anticipate that we will be able to create ~5 intellectual property rights (e.g., patent applications, market rights, licensing schemes). Notably, numerous collaborations with academic and commercial partners are already underway (~20 academic, ~10 industry). What will be done during the course of the grant to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research? Within our consortium, results will be disseminated and exploited by i) two major meetings per year where all participants meet, ii) a monthly online conference of lab heads, iii) a weekly conference of the work force, iv) regular work meetings in participants' labs, v) use of a web-based communication platform with project database and forum, vi) exchange of results via our novel Portable Genome Format (PGF) data format and the GLOBE 3D Genome platform. At the local level, we will train members of the consortium through: i) meetings, ii) online conferences, iii) work meetings/exchanges, and iv) virtual meetings using our browser/platform. At the global level that affects society at large we plan to: i) hold a workshop open to the scientist and the public, ii) 'market' our results at academic conferences, iii) generate active academic and industrial partnerships, iv) build a website with information accessible to the general public, and v) hold open media events in participating countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>377521</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project was part of a European consortium. The focus of the group in Oxford (Cook/Papantonis) was on the changes occurring when human cells were treated with a powerful cytokine - TNFa - which plays a role in mounting the defense against infection. A huge amount of data has been amassed using high-throughput sequencing to assess which genes became more (or less) active. In addition, the response of one gene was studied in great detail. Results showed that the molecular machines that copy DNA into RNA do not track like locomotives down the template (as all the textbooks would have us believe); rather, they become transiently immobilized in discrete sites which we call 'factories' when they are active. Furthermore, some of these factories specialize in transcribing different groups of genes. Consequently, this research is changing the way these vital machines work, and how the human genome is organized in three-dimensional space.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>If our ideas are
