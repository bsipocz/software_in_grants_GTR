It is a criminal offence to supply water that is unfit for human consumption. Wholesomeness is defined by reference to prescribed concentrations assigned to various microbiological, chemical and physical parameters. Prescribed concentrations or values for microbiological parameters rely on indicator organisms, such as coliform bacteria, E. coli and colony counts. In addition to meeting standards, water must not contain any micro-organism or parasite at a concentration which would constitute a potential danger to human health. To help safeguard quality of water supply, there is an urgent national and international need to provide novel real-time water quality assessment tools and techniques. It is proposed here that an innovative solution to this issue is to exploit the fluorescence characteristics of drinking water through the development of novel instrumentation. All water fluoresces; however most of the fluorescence is emitted in the ultraviolet, so it is invisible to the human eye. However, off-the-shelf equipment can detect this fluorescence. Previous work has identified relationships between fluorescence and river (i.e. raw) water quality. Specifically, it has been shown that fluorescence emitted at 340-370 nm under excitation at 220-240nm or 270-280nm (tryptophan-like fluorescence) is indicative of microbial activity, whilst fluorescence emitted at 400-480nm under excitation at 300-360nm (fulvic-like fluorescence) is indicative of the presence of organic carbon. The sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy to microbial material presents the opportunity to effect a major step change in water quality assessment techniques, moving beyond the dated and limited use of indicator organisms, to enhance security of supply to customers. This project focuses on the design, rigorous testing (progressing from bench top to field prototype) and implementation of the first all-LED dual peak potable water quality assessment tool for deployment within water distribution systems. This would represent a significant advance in the real-time assessment of water quality and proactive management of potable water distribution systems.The potential application and benefits of the impacts from this research are significant. The project's deliverables will have a direct impact upon:1. the nation's health (through its improvements to network supply and management of safe water resources) and2. the nation's wealth through cost savings achieved through optimisation of sampling and analysis of networks and an anticipated reduction in analysis costs compared to current approaches.The beneficiaries of these impacts are diverse and include:1. the general public,2. the commercial private sector (e.g. instrument manufacturers and private water companies),3. regulators (e.g. in the UK the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate),4. legislators and planners, 5. UK-based and international academics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research falls within the EPSRC signposted 'Water Engineering' theme 'Real-time condition monitoring and early warning of failure' and will enhance the water industry's real-time proactive management of networks. Thus, the timeliness of this proposal is clear. This is a novel, multi-institution project with the degree of risk balanced by the potential of high return and impact. The research outlined in this proposal is truly adventurous and transformative in nature. If successful, the scientific and technological developments will lead to radically new means of assessing treated water quality. Not only does it bring new insight into water science and characterisation together with technological innovation, the research also offers novel developments in water quality assessment techniques at a time when they are most needed, offering the industry a step change from time-consuming microbial enumeration of discrete samples to real-time, in-situ, continuous analysis and management of water quality. Instrument output can be used to assess risks associated with chlorine addition, microbial presence, and TOC concentration, giving the user a robust tool to provide an initial assessment of quality, and to identify systems at risk of compliance failure and to public health. Furthermore, delivery of the current sustainability agenda (e.g. successful implementation of, inter alia, rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse and local groundwater abstraction) requires cheap, reliable and deskilled means of measuring water quality. Thus, the potential application and benefits of the impacts from this research are many-fold. Consequently, the project's deliverables will have a direct impact upon: (1) the nation's health (through its improvements to network supply and management of safe water resources) and (2) the nation's wealth through cost savings achieved through optimisation of sampling and analysis of networks and an anticipated (although currently undefined) reduction in analysis costs compared to colony counting. Importantly, the project has been designed such that the deliverables are phased, with the first benefits being realised after the first year with the tap assessment device, and the in-situ distribution device deployed the following year so that the real, tangible benefits are realised as soon as possible. The beneficiaries of these impacts are diverse and include: 1. the general public, 2. the commercial private sector (e.g. instrument manufacturers and private water companies), 3. regulators (e.g. in the UK the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate), 4. legislators and planners, 5. UK-based and international academics. The means by which these beneficiaries will realise the benefits are laid out in the attached Impact Plan, but key to this will be effective project management. Bridgeman and Boxall are experienced academic researchers. Baker will provide a scientific overview throughout. He will routinely provide expert opinion on datasets and will contribute to meetings via video conferencing or in person. However, the fact that Baker is based overseas means that the project will have continuous global coverage and interest throughout its lifetime, generating real global impact. The Investigators will liaise with the industrial partners to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and technology from research to the field and vice versa. Project direction will be driven by a Steering Committee, the composition and role of which is discussed in the Impact Plan. This complex project requires appropriate management. A schedule of project risks and associated mitigation strategies will be created and monitored by the PDRF and PI. Project risks and timelines will be managed continually as part of the Project Plan, all ultimately geared to delivering the high impacts which are available.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221272</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Utilities Group PLC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF375988-7930-4ECB-BB94-166D6F3875C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b966b75ab966b76e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water throughout the course of the project in the application of the created technology to real world treatment and supply conditions (e.g. collection and monitoring of sample waters).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Severn Trent Water</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEABAEB7-88DA-4415-A1F3-241127C5BA94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b966b64cb966b660-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water throughout the course of the project in the application of the created technology to real world treatment and supply conditions (e.g. collection and monitoring of sample waters).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Northumbrian Water</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF2F66BF-83BE-4D09-B869-0AB97CA0EC47</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b966b9a8b966b9c6-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration with Severn Trent Water / United Utilities / Northumbrian Water throughout the course of the project in the application of the created technology to real world treatment and supply conditions (e.g. collection and monitoring of sample waters).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WRc Innovation Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0F72F0EB-8948-4D67-883D-D2EDEDAC9D2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstration of Duo Fluor instrument at Innovation Day held by WRc, Swindon.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e11dfc5839e1.45079590</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Severn Trent - &quot;Lunch and Learn&quot; session</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0989E34E-9D23-4495-81FE-4343C23F0F3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20 minute oral presentation given to staff (approx. 20) in Severn Trent Water's clean and dirty water process operations, summarizing work and key findings.

Current methods of analysing and enumerating the quality of drinking water currently take a minimum of 18 hours and up to several days in some cases. This is not fast enough to meet the needs of both post-disaster and low-resource communities. The Water Engineering Research Group at the University of Birmingham, led by Professor John Bridgeman, has developed an optical device that is able to indicate in less than 30 seconds whether water is likely to contain high levels of bacteria and so be unsafe to drink. The device uses a technique called fluorescence spectroscopy to scan the water and highlight pollutants that are present in the sample.
All water fluoresces; a molecule absorbs a high-energy photon and re-emits a lower-energy photon with a longer wavelength. Usually the absorbance is in the ultraviolet range, and the emitted light is in the visible range, but this depends on the particular molecule. Despite being undetected by the human eye as a result of the eye's insensitivity to the appropriate wavelengths, off-the-shelf equipment can detect this fluorescence. A large body of research has demonstrated that water fluorescence is particularly good at identifying faecal contamination. In the laboratory, a range of excitation wavelengths are used and emitted light is detected is detected at the corresponding, longer emission wavelength. The fluorescence intensity is then plotted for each wavelength pair to produce a contour map of fluorescence for the sample.
The focus of the latest research at Birmingham is derived from the widespread observation of intrinsic fluorescence emitted at certain wavelengths in all types of faecal-derived waters; commonly referred to as fluorescence peak T, or tryptophan-like fluorescence. Fluorescence is emitted from tryptophan molecules present as microbial and algogenic cellular material, both living and dead. 
In a diverse range of surface and waste waters, Bridgeman and colleagues have shown that the intensity of this fluorescence correlates with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a determinand used by environment agencies worldwide to assess river and wastewater quality. Work with the Environment Agency (EA) in recent years has shown that, for several geographical areas, a correlation exists between peak T fluorescence intensity and the EA water quality grade. Laboratory microbial culture experiments have shown a direct correlation between peak T fluorescence intensity and total microbial cell counts. It has become apparent that peak T fluorescence intensity can be directly related to the ecological health of freshwater. 

The current research programme is building on the previous work where fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to detect sewage in rivers. Now the prototype is being used for the first time to establish bacterial numbers in a wide range of water samples (including river water and effluent from sewage treatment works) and the results compared with those from a conventional bench top fluorescence spectrophotometer. 
Preliminary testing, research and prototype development demonstrate the potential of using a portable fluorimeter as an initial screening tool for indicative microbial water quality, and one that is ideally suited to simple pollution scenarios such as assessing the impact of faecal contamination in river or groundwater at specific sites.
The Group's innovative LED-based instrument, &amp;quot;Duo Fluor&amp;quot; uses inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment that is portable and so can be used from the back of a 4x4 vehicle which is particularly useful where laboratory facilities are not at hand. Furthermore, there is the ability to have both expert interpretation of results as well as simplified pictorial interpretation for use by non-experts in individual communities. Thus, the innovative approach to improving the efficiency of analysis has the additional benefit of community empowerment through involving poor water users themselves in the application of the technology. 
The research team is now seeking to refine the Duo Fluor design and operational procedures, to make it ideally suited to disaster relief and areas of poor sanitation. By facilitating the timely detection of unsafe sources of drinking water, the Group believes it will be able to offer a reliable technique to help minimize the likelihood of future widespread outbreaks of cholera and other water-related diseases in areas of poor sanitation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E8573ED-3E0A-40EF-A306-723BDFBFF067</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Applications to disater relief
Advantages of fluorescence screening of water include rapid analysis time; something urgently needed in disaster relief. The Birmingham work has shown that results can be made available in less than one minute, significantly improving on existing coliform count technology. 
The technological limitation to date has been the need for a portable light source that emits in the ultraviolet range. Bridgeman's team recently overcame this with the production of portable prototype instruments, developed for the analysis of peak T fluorescence and also for peak C fluorescence - which is used as a surrogate for humic and fulvic acid presence. An ideal application of these sensors is the real-time, hand held analysis of the microbiological quality of drinking water, particularly in areas of poor or no sanitation as widely found in developing countries and during disaster relief scenarios.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e057893bb887.67959170</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Duo Fluor</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The project has advanced the use of LED based technology for the measurement of peak C and peak T fluorescence in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. .</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7FAE9F0-A9F0-4EED-B6D4-DC19966D1F3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved monitoring of water quality at treatment works and in distribution systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2091095924.46228126fd4803e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Improved measurement of peak C and peak T fluorescence using a portable, battery powered LED device</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A portable advanced prototype instrument, developed for the analysis of peak T fluorescence and also for peak C fluorescence - which is used as a surrogate for humic and fulvic acid presence.
