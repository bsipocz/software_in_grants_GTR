This remarkable process, termed chromosome replication, requires the coordinated action of many complex and highly regulated molecular machines. These machines have evolved to be extremely accurate, helping to ensure that the majority of replication cycles are completed without error. Despite this impressive accuracy some mistakes are unavoidable due to the sheer volume of information that must be copied and the presence of obstacles, such as DNA damage, that can interrupt and even derail the replication machinery. Mistakes, even when generated infrequently, can have serious consequences that can lead to unregulated cell growth, fuel genomic instability and ultimately result in cancer development. 
Our research aims to elucidate molecular mechanisms that underpin faithful chromosome replication on pristine DNA and DNA that has been damaged, for example by ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. We will exploit a novel experimental system that we have recently developed. Our approach enables us to assemble in vitro the molecular machines responsible for copying DNA from isolated individual components. We then study these machines in action using a variety of biochemical, biophysical and structural techniques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Precise chromosome replication is essential to maintain genome stability, yet the process itself is inherently risky. Duplex DNA must be separated into less stable single-strands, a huge number of DNA bases must be accurately copied, collisions occur between the replication and transcription machineries and replication forks frequently encounter unrepaired DNA lesions. Deciphering how the replication machinery (replisome) navigates these challenges is essential to understand how faithful chromosome replication is accomplished, and how mutations and genome rearrangements are minimised.
The eukaryotic replisome is a large multi-subunit complex assembled in a two-step process that is initiated in G1 when the motor component of the replicative helicase (MCM) is loaded at replication origins. As cells enter S phase MCM is activated to form the CMG helicase, the replisome is assembled and DNA replication is initiated. During my recent postdoctoral work I reconstituted regulated eukaryotic DNA replication initiation with purified proteins for the first time. The reaction uses 16 purified replication factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate a minimal replisome capable of leading- and lagging-strand synthesis.
In addition to the proteins required for replication initiation, numerous other factors are needed for complete chromosome replication of which many are poorly characterised. These include several core replisome components, the lagging strand machinery and proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. Our aim is to build upon the minimal replisome to assemble a complete eukaryotic replisome with purified proteins. We will investigate replisome structure and mechanisms using well-established structural, biochemical and biophysical techniques, in conjunction with a cell free extract replication system and yeast genetics.
The reconstituted replication system will also be used to address the fundamental question of how replication forks respond to DNA template damage. Multiple pathways target stalled forks to restart replication yet many questions remain about the factors that influence pathway selection. We aim to characterise the molecular mechanisms of stalled replication fork processing together with the principles that govern pathway choices.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207047</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>71000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust Fellowship - Taylor</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Dundee</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>604A1A05-4178-4CA5-99F4-837F67543ED7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bee321d0e7d1.66580746</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1201/12</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
