&lt;p>The workshops were designed to address the questions of how to apply evidence based knowledge exchange on security issues and help identify barriers to reporting of crime for the road freight industry through interaction with the road haulage industry and other stakeholders. Existing information/research on the subject to be presented followed by facilitated discussion to identify good practice, the findings from which to be fed into the conference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The workshops would be undertaken across England and Wales during October 2011 and will be attended by hauliers, insurance companies, trade organisations, regional police forces and TRUCKPOL (part of Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The&amp;nbsp; events will drive forward knowledge exchange through the facilitation of dialogue between stakeholders in and beyond the social science community and further develop the connections and understanding of security issues within the road freight industry whilst also identifying and sharing good practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this activity? 
The community will benefit in terms of improved or sustained economy through continued employment opportunities; improvements to the health and well being of Heavy Goods Vehicle drivers through improved security measures for those sleeping in their cabs and the resultant overall improvements to road safety. Other people who would benefit from this activity are the police, insurance companies, commercial private sector- hauliers, and government departments. Local authorities , in light of the Localism Bill, will be better informed in the planning process and their Section 17 (Crime and Disorder Act 1998) obligations.
How might they benefit from this activity?
It is anticipated that the workshops, conference and related publicity will stimulate interest in the topic of freight crime and raise awareness of the importance of reporting and recording accurately and consistently. Whilst isolated incidents may seem relatively trivial they should be seen as part of the wider overall business crime picture and the effect this has on the economy.
Crime prevention advice will be offered at the workshops to help improve the personal safety of drivers. It is also understood that many drivers do not sleep properly in their cabs because of fear of attack, hijack and/or of having their loads stolen. Therefore the advice given and the sharing of good practice within the workshops will also help to improve quality of life for drivers and road safety generally. Greater awareness of the issue will potentially also lead to improved security of loads and consequently affect economic prosperity of businesses who cannot afford even small losses in this austere economic climate 
The events will 'contribute towards evidence based policy-making and influencing public policies and legislation at a local, regional, national and international level' and help shape and enhance the effectiveness of public and private services. They will provide a conduit to share research and good practice with all stakeholders and have the potential to change organisational culture and practices. A collaborative approach is necessary to tackle the problem and the event will provide the opportunity for all key stakeholders to contribute, maximise opportunities and minimise barriers thus helping to build/consolidate relationships with key partners and collaborators and share experience and expertise
Ascertaining the size of the problem has previously proved difficult, however the events will draw on a wide range of sources to better demonstrate the extent of the problem and to help in identifying ways in which freight crime can be prevented. The workshops will also offer a safe space for stakeholders to freely discuss issues arising and to share good practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9982</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J000426/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-192-22-0145</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
