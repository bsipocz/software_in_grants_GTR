This will help the development of a more efficient vaccine.||One mechanism that the body uses to stop malaria parasites from invading red blood cells is by making proteins called antibodies. Some of these antibodies are made against proteins on the surface of the parasite, called ligands, which can bind to receptors on the surface of the red blood cell and thereby blocking their entry into the red blood cell. Parasites can vary the amount of ligand that they produce and by doing so they can use different receptors on the surface of the red blood cell, therefore, creating different routes of invasion.||Recent studies have shown that parasites change the amount of ligand that they produced as a strategy to avoid the immune system. Antibodies, specific to a particular ligand, present before a malaria infection will have an effect on the number of clinical infections with parasites producing that same ligand. Thus, the ability of the parasite to change the amount of ligand that it produces will create a challenge that vaccine development will be facing. It is therefore crucial to understand the role that antibodies specific to these ligands play in determining how much ligand the parasite produces so we can develop a better vaccine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The specific receptor-ligand interactions involved in the invasion of erythrocytes by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, are central to malaria parasite replication and virulence. By changing the levels of expression of some of these ligands, such as the erythrocyte binding antigenic proteins (EBAs) and reticulocyte binding protein homologues (Rh), cultured adapted parasite lines have been shown to use different erythrocyte receptors to mediate alternative pathways of erythrocyte invasion. SCC1003 and other studies have also shown a considerable heterogeneity in the invasion profiles of fresh field isolates and alternative expression of the Rhs and ebas invasion ligands. The variant expression of invasion related proteins might be a strategy used by the parasite to escape the immune response from the host. We therefore hypothesised that Rh and EBA specific antibodies may select for parasites with different levels of expression of these ligands. In a cross-sectional and cohort follow up for active case detection during the 2008 malaria transmission season, we addressed this by investigating the levels of Rh and EBA specific antibodies before the season and transcription levels of these ligands during subsequent malaria infections. The results of this study will help to understand whether variant expression of invasion-related proteins is under selection from naturally-acquired antibody responses. If so, this mechanism needs to be considered in relation to the vaccine candidacy of these molecules.||A blood sample was taken on the day of recruitment from 800 children below the age of 15 years, from 8 villages West of Farafenni, and the plasma was used to measure the level of antibodies against Rhs and EBAs using ELISA at the beginning of the malaria season. Recombinant EBA and Rh antigens were obtained from collaboration with James Beesons laboratory in WEHI, Australia. The cohort of children was followed up with active case detection and a venous blood sample was collected whenever a malaria episode was confirmed. The plasma was used to measure the level of antibodies against Rhs and EBAs during an active malaria infection. The erythrocytes were cultured until they reached schizont stage of development and RNA was extracted for real time PCR analysis of Rhs and eba transcript levels.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>406891</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190092706</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
