The clandestine Jesuit mission to England began in 1580 and by the mid-1590s the first missioners had ventured into Wales, operating covertly to avoid falling foul of extensive penal legislation banning the presence of 'Jesuits and seminary priests' in the kingdom. In the mid-1590s, the Welsh Jesuit, Robert Jones (c.1564-1615) was based at Raglan Castle in Monmouthshire as a guest of Edward Somerset (c.1550-1628), fourth earl of Worcester. As lord lieutenant of both Monmouthshire and Glamorgan, admiral of the Severn, earl marshal of England and privy councillor, the earl was all-powerful in the southern Welsh Marches. About 1600 he allowed the Jesuits to establish a settlement on his lands in a strategically located but secluded place called the Cwm, at Llanrothal, Herefordshire, on the very border of Wales. This became the headquarters of what was designated by the Jesuit Superior General in Rome as the *Collegium Sancti Francisci Xaverii* -- the territorial College of St Francis Xavier -- the largest sub-division of the English Province of the Society of Jesus formed in 1623. Up to 1667, the College covered the whole of Wales, Monmouthshire and the four English counties of Shropshire, Hereford, Gloucester and Somerset: after 1667, the College's Welsh territory was reduced to the southern half of Wales. From about 1600 until 1678 the Jesuits built up an important library at Cwm. In December 1678, at the height of the so-called Popish Plot, the Bishop of Hereford, Herbert Croft (1603-1691), ordered Cwm to be raided, closed down and its library seized. The latter collection was then taken to Hereford Cathedral Library where it lay virtually untd from 1679 until the spring of 2010 when it was catalogued professionally for the first time. The new, fully searchable catalogue is now available on-line at: http://asp.bibits.no/hereford-cathedral/wssearch.asp \n\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThis project aims to study and analysis:\n\n-- the genesis and development of the territorial College from about 1600 to 1679;\n-- its aristocratic patronage and protection throughout this period;\n-- its library of approximately 170 books - the largest surviving seventeenth-century Jesuit library in Britain - secretly transported from the continent before 1670.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to:\n\n-- support a PhD student in producing a scholarly thesis, significant elements of which will be publishable, lifting the history of the Jesuits in Wales and the south-west of England out of centuries of obscurity, demonstrating the vibrancy of their work, despite penal legislation, and throwing significant new light on an important period of English and Welsh religious history;\n\n-- digitize the title-pages and annotations of the most significant volumes in the Cwm library and make them available to a wide public through the Hereford Cathedral web site and through a variety of exhibitions, allowing the PhD research to set them in their full context.\n \n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS\n\nThe recent cataloguing of the Jesuit library at Hereford Cathedral followed investigations by Professor Maurice Whitehead in the Chained Library at Hereford in 2006-2008 when 40 previously unidentified books of indisputable Cwm provenance were rediscovered. By using the new, definitive catalogue, which includes provenance and ownership records, a PhD student will now be able to interrogate and analyse the collection fully for the time, unlocking an important but hidden part of the cultural heritage preserved in the Hereford Cathedral Library collections and making it available to a wide public.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>HEREFORD CATHEDRAL: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND OUTREACH\nIn addition to caring for archives, historic manuscripts and printed books, Hereford Cathedral is fully committed to making these materials accessible to a wide public and to interpreting them to different audiences. Like most cathedrals, Hereford has limited resources, and its Library and Archives staff are unable to devote time to the in-depth study of discrete collections under their care. \n\nThe Cwm Jesuit library at Hereford has long awaited serious scholarly study, and the fruits of the project proposed in this bid will benefit many. The succesful completion of the project will contribute to Hereford Cathedral Library's own knowledge of this significant collection, which its own staff can use to help future scholars and researchers looking at seventeenth-century material in the reading room there. On its completion, the project will also help in disseminating knowledge to a wider audience, through temporary exhibitions, guiding special interest groups, as well as teaching school children studying seventeenth century history. \n\nThe project will also have impact on Hereford Cathedral Library's work with students at university level. The Library already contributes to MA programmes at Swansea University, as well as other institutions, focussing on the medieval and early modern worlds. Greater knowledge of the Cwm printed collection can but assist with this important work. Published work resulting from the project will also provide the Cathedral Library with a higher profile within the bibliographical world, demonstrating that Hereford does not possess the Chained Library alone, but that it is itself able to stimulate further work into other collections in its custody.\n\nWALES AND THE MARCHES: AN UNDER-RESEARCHED AREA\nThe results of the research will provide a major contribution to the historiography of religion in Wales and the Marches in the early modern period. The existing historiography on this subject is thin, reflecting many decades in which the religious history of the area has been under-researched. The project has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of this area and to encourage and stimulate further research in the future.\n\nSWANSEA UNIVERSITY: ACADEMIC SYNERGIES AND COGNATE RESEARCH\nThe project will dovetail with, and have an impact on, a range of research already in train by a number of academic staff in the College of Arts and Humanities at Swansea, including Geraint Evans's cutting-edge work on Welsh recusancy (http://www.swan.ac.uk/news_centre/News/Headline,35212,en.php), Stefan Halikowski's work on Jesuits in an international context, and Whitehead's work on the English and Welsh Jesuit diaspora in continental Europe. It also relates directly to a highly successful research symposium, entitled *Reformation and Recusants*, held at Swansea University on 4 June 2010.\n\nTHE AHRC *Who were the nuns?* PROJECT\nThe synergies that the project could have with the *Who were the nuns?* project at Queen Mary, London, mentioned above, should not be under-estimated. Collaboration between the two projects has the potential to demonstrate to the wider world the positive research benefits to be gained by historians working together in cognate areas.\n\nWIDER, INTERNATIONAL IMPACT\nAt the wider, international level, the findings will also have impact, given the unique nature of the Jesuit Library at Hereford as the only seventeenth-century Jesuit library surviving on British soil. This will be achieved principally through the international *Jesuitica* network, based at Leuven (http://www.jesuitica.be/). This is a network of historians working in many countries worldwide on Jesuit history -- and one in which Maurice Whitehead is an active member. Through this channel, news of research results and new publications can be transmi</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023384/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
