Tomatoes are high value products with an annual value in 2009 of around 32 billion US dollars covering both processed and fresh products. They are a major component of healthy diets and provide ready sources of vitamins A, C, E and K, minerals including K and Fe and the lipophilic antioxidant lycopene (the pigment responsible for the characteristic red colour of ripe tomato fruit). There is a wealth of scientific evidence that now exists to corroborate that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is beneficial to human health. These benefits have been attributed to the presence of health promoting phytochemicals or &amp;quot;bioactives&amp;quot; in the food matrix. The challenge, particularly, in Western societies, is to deliver to the consumer better tasting, more nutritious tomatoes and other fruit which have a prolonged shelf-life at a cost affordable to the majority of consumers. The most important quality traits in tomato are colour, texture, flavour and nutritional content. Texture can also impact on taste, the release of nutrients and perhaps most importantly shelf-life. In the UK it is estimated that 40% of the food waste is uneaten fruits and vegetables. 
In addition to its economic and societal role, tomato has become a well established scientific model for understanding the development and ripening of fleshy fruit bearing crops, with strong evidence that many of the gene networks controlling ripening have been conserved across different taxa. In fruit crops, the key controller of quality traits is the process of ripening. The aim of TomNET project is to deliver better quality tomato fruit. Our approach will integrate systems analysis and quantitative genetic studies to identify and modulate regulatory genes that allow precise control of fruit development and the ripening process. By harnessing tomato wild-species variation, we can deliver these scientific discoveries into commercial practice in collaboration with Syngenta; our industrial partner in this LINK project. 
The project will build on several important resources and findings. Firstly a regulatory network holistically describing the interaction of gene transcripts during fruit development and ripening. Using computational approaches putative regulators of the ripening process have been identified. We have shown that one of these regulators can improve tomato fruit colour. Simultaneously, flavour related compounds responsible for good tasting fruit products are increased. In this project we will use the gene networks to identify additional regulators of ripening that display the potential to alter key fruit quality traits. For the transcriptional activator termed high pigment-4 (HP4), which we have validated as an important modulator of ripening related traits, detail characterisation at multiple levels of regulation will be carried out to ascertain the underlying mechanisms by which the gene product can exert its effects and influence the ripening process. The other key foundation of this project is the identification of genes underlying a complex QTL for texture. Within the target region several interacting components have been identified. In the project the function and interaction between these components will be elucidated by using stable transgenic lines. Combining the enhanced colour and texture traits will also be attempted. Finally natural variation will be exploited to deliver these traits into commercial elite backgrounds thus translating science discovery through to commercial practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Building on outputs derived from transcriptional networks constructed for tomato fruit development and ripening and from quantitative genetics studies. We will now validate, characterise and translate the molecular tools identified into commercial backgrounds using the following technical approach.
1. Exploitation of the ripening regulatory network. Following our successful identification of a network derived transcription activator (HP4), involved in fruit pigmentation. Further functional testing of candidate genes regulating ripening and especially colour, texture and flavour will be carried out using Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) and through the generation of stable transgenic lines. 
2. Characterisation of the HP4 transcriptional activator. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with the action of HP4 in conferring ripening associated quality traits, we will perform an integrative multi-level approach to characterisation of the phenotype including detailed metabolomics. 
3. Testing the involvement of QTL derived candidates in altering fruit texture. Candidate genes underlying texture QTL on tomato chromosomes 2 and 3 will be tested in transgenic plants. Detailed phenotypic assessment including texture, determinations, transcript and metabolite profiling and cell wall analysis will elucidate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of texture and shelf-life in our target QTL regions. 
4. Combining enhanced colour and texture phenotypes. Crosses will be performed to ascertain how mutant alleles and QTLs responsible for colour and texture-based traits will function in combination and if they act in a synergistic manner. 
5. Delivery of the traits into commercial practice. Using the unique resources of our industrial partner we will demonstrate the translational potential of candidate genes or QTL regions by marker assisted introgression into the parent of an elite hybrid.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs from the proposal will have significant economic and societal impacts. The economic beneficiaries will include Syngenta, the largest UK affiliated Global Agricultural Biotechnology Business. This multinational company with one of its major International R+D sites at Jealott's Hill near Bracknell and the industrial partner in this LINK application. The Syngenta Vegetable Seeds business is worth several &amp;pound; bn to the company annually. Tomato is the highest value crop. Syngenta will benefit from the development of new elite tomato lines that add significant value to their seeds portfolio. The IP will be capture through international patent applications. They will also benefit from enhanced knowledge that can be applied to other crops including other Solanaceae such as sweet pepper fruits. There is now compelling evidence that genes regulating ripening are conserved across fleshy fruit species offering opportunities to exploit knowledge from TomNET for crop improvement of other fleshy fruit bearing species. We anticipate that TomNET will have benefits beyond our industrial sponsor. The British Tomato Growers utilize Syngenta lines and improved products normally lead to increased demand from the consumer. The UK fresh market in tomato products, has a retail value in excess of &amp;pound;0.5bn / year at present and the market is expanding. Fresh produce is of course a major line of business for retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury, Waitrose, which are some of the largest companies in the UK. They will benefit by the added value of improved product quality, nutritional status and shelf-life resulting in higher profits from consumer demand and repeat purchase. The most important benefits should be to consumers in the UK and elsewhere. Benefits to the UK public should include improved products with longer shelf-life. Also better quality foods encourage repeat purchasing and increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables is a major target for improving diet and towards hlthier aging for the population. A secondary economic benefit will be that the UK Government benefits through enhanced tax receipts from the companies and success in the private sector can lead to job creation. 
To be competitive and reap the benefits this brings in a global economy, the UK needs a strong R+D base and a skilled workforce. The UK R+D sector will benefit from projects that attract industrial investment. TomNET provides training for PDRAs within the context of the demands of an industrial sponsor. This will enhance skills in the work force and the competitiveness of UK R+D. Syngenta have access to global R+D efforts and are under no obligation to make a UK based investment on criteria other than internationally competitive science coupled with value for money. The pathways for communicating the results to industry and academia are well established and will involve high impact publications and dissemination through scientific and public events such as the International Solanaceae Conference, UK Plant Science Federation events and also the tomato growers annual conference and the Society of Biology. The UK must be involved in internationally competitive projects using state of the art multidisciplinary and integrative biology approaches that take science discovery through to commercial practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>271640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nottingham University</gtr:description><gtr:id>E775D63C-E848-49EA-8AC9-870ECD047906</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

TomNet is a LINK award with the industrial partner being Syngenta Ltd. Therefore the primary commercial exploitation has been accessed by Syngenta. One patent relating to High Pigment (HP) -4, which encodes the unknown transcription factor (Arabidopsis pseudo response factor) has been applied for and approved. A subsequent QTL within the S.pennellii introgression collection has been identified that can confer moderate enhancement of health promoting phytochemicals such as tocopherols and carotenoids has been identified. Colour intensity has also been conferred. The QTL and diversity created from TILLED lines will enable access into direct commercial practice.
2. The data and outputs generated from the TomNet projects have advanced the scientific knowledge in the field and will benefit other researchers working in the field. For example at the point of publication within the next 12 months the following information will be released.
- A predictive Gene Regulatory Netwrok (GRN) that can be extrapolated to ascertain HUBs linked to quality traits. 
- Large scale RNA-Seq and metabolomic datasets will be released into public databases and on the PIs PURE websites. 
- New genetic resources such as transgenic plants, TILLED mutants and microIL have been generated. 
3. The regulatory gene networks (RGN) generated from transcriptomic datasets has delivered a plethora of candidate genes. These candidate genes are being validated and to date four gene products have been shown to alter fruit quality and yield. Syngenta are presently evaluating the potential of IP capture on these gene and alleles. One reason for the delay has been the uncertainty over the future of Syngenta in the UK. 
4. A major QTL for fruit texture and shelf-life extension has been identified. This region was identified within the S.pennelli introgression collection within Chr3. The effector gene has been shown to be a Pectin lyase allele. Detailed metabolomic analysis has demonstrated that texture can be altered to create firmer fruits without affecting other quality traits such as colour and aroma. This allele/gene has been patented by Syngenta and introgressed into their elite backgrounds for evaluation and direct commercial application. There is also a manuscript under revision with Nature Biotechnology. 
5. Training has been an important aspect of the project with the project RA spending placements at the industrial partner's UK base to learn volatile analysis on specialised equipment. In addition they have completed the &amp;quot;On-Track&amp;quot; programme at RHUL directed towards complementary scientific training. A PhD student has worked alongside the RA and been trained in biochemistry, molecular biology and plant biotechnology. 
6. The RA employed on the project has had two maternity leaves during the project duration. Flexibility in their work was been used to enable the RA to return to work and has subsequently obtained employment within the group at RHUL.
7. The project outline and findings have been presented at most RHUL open-days in the form of displays, posters and talks by the PI. The outputs have been described by the PI to the UK tomato growers association and two presentations to the retailer Waitrose. There is a clear reluctance to embrace new varieties or practices from these organisations which has hindered developments. The exception has been Burpee seeds Ltds but despite three Agri-tech applications to support this SME and progress developments no funding has been achieved limiting the potential impact. The PI has presented the findings from the project at HAPI conferences and applications have been made to HAPI funds to follow on the work with the industrial partner but the two applications have been unsuccessful. Two manuscripts have resulted from the work performed on TomNet and a further four manuscripts are in preparation. In addition there is one manuscript in revision for Nature Biotechnology. The project RA performed regular talks at Syngenta including presentations at their research station's research days. The PI presented the work at three international conferences Plant Molecular Biology, South Korea 2013, The international metabolomics conference, Glasgow 2013 and international Solanaceae conference, Bordeaux 2015. Presentations have also been made to the COST ACTIONS FA1006 Plant engineering and FA1106 fruit quality. The PI has also incorporated outputs from the project into the teaching curriculum into the RHUL degree programmes. 
8. The outputs from the project has attracted one RHUL College studentship to continue the work and one iCASE award to transfer information to Capsicum fruit. The situation with Syngenta and potential divestments with over companies has limited direct follow-on activities but they have been partners on two subsequent EU projects H2020 applications. 
9.

By altering the level of the HP4 gene product, fruit colour, vitamin E (tocopherols), the carotenoid based antioxidants and provitamin A (beta-carotene) can be altered. Metabolomic studies have also revealed multi-level metabolic regulation resulting in changes in the sugar content and organic acids within the HP4 modulated fruit. 
2. The studies performed in this award have demonstrated unequivocally that systems biology outputs can be explored to identify and extrapolate candidate genes with the potential to alter that quality in tomato. Presently, four candidate genes termed ESB4, 6, 9 and 10 have been successfully modulated in tomato to show increased fruit yield, altered ripening times, increased pigmentation and altered fruit firmness. 
3. An influential QTL conferring improved fruit texture has been identified. The candidate gene(s) have been identified by fine mapping and RNA-Seq. Subsequently this candidate has been modulated in transgenic plants by RNAi and CRISPR technology. The allele can confer improved texture traits without altering other ripening related components such as aroma, colour or taste (parameters). This represents a major tool for the conferring of texture in fleshy fruit. The allele has been introgressed into the appropriate commercial backgrounds used by the industrial partner. 
4. Traits such as texture and colour have been stacked in tomato varieties the F2 generation are showing improved quality fruits (colour and texture) and further analysis required to confirm the robustness. 
5. New varieties with altered ripening and quality attributes</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. The industrial partner being Syngenta Ltd have filed two patents from the work and can apply the technology directly into commercial practice through the development of new varieties using natural alleles capable of conferring the traits of interest. 
2. The data and outputs generated from the TomNet projects have advanced the scientific knowledge in the field and will benefit other researchers and academic benefactors working in the field. For example at the point of publication within the next 12 months the following information will be released.
- A predictive Gene Regulatory Netwrok (GRN) that can be extrapolated to ascertain HUBs linked to quality traits. 
- Large scale RNA-Seq and metabolomic datasets will be released into public databases and on the PIs PURE websites. 
- New genetic resources such as transgenic plants, TILLED mutants and microIL have been generated. 
3. The regulatory gene networks (RGN) generated from transcriptomic datasets has delivered a plethora of candidate genes. Syngenta are presently evaluating the potential of IP capture on these gene and alleles. 
4. The project RA has benefited from spending placements at the industrial partner's UK base and can now relay the information to the information to members of the scientific community working in the field. A PhD student will be trained in biochemistry, molecular biology and plant biotechnology. 
5. The project outline and findings have been disseminated to the public, scientific community and various sectors of industry throughout the supply chain. 
6. The outputs from the project has attracted further funding and several unsuccessful applications. 
7. Because the work has been carried out in tomato translation of the findings to other fleshy fruit has been readily performed.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BB3190EC-C8DB-4BE3-879C-8EE30EC45EC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db2660a1f326.49952767</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/admin/workspace</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Inputed large sacle datasets</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C9A329E-5B6F-4E77-A13E-1D104107F298</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data has been utilised by other scientists and industry</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb82874af55.87726638</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Solanaceae Genome Network</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://solgenomics.net/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Protocols for plastid isolation publised in BIoprotocols</gtr:description><gtr:id>4E64ABE2-F4EC-43BC-8BD5-21DB7E553604</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enabled groups to use the protocol</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddba1dd95603.00807081</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Protocols for plastid isolation publised in BIoprotocols</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63806C8C-71D7-41F0-88BA-BC6C8F95F1A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metabolic engineering of astaxanthin biosynthesis in maize endosperm and characterization of a prototype high oil hybrid.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transgenic research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc735243df1eb289efc4032a1e0e75c9"><gtr:id>bc735243df1eb289efc4032a1e0e75c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Farr?
