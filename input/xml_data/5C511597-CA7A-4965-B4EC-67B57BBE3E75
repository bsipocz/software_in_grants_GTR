In doing so, this project emphasises both the politicising impact of incarceration and prisoners' agency in challenging the strict racial order inside penal institutions.

While the last eight years has seen an outpouring of research on the black power movement, the involvement of African American prisoners remains an underexplored area. This monograph-length study will draw together a broad range of sources, including prisoners' writing, sociological research, personal narratives, underground publications, F.B.I. reports, and mainstream media to offer the first comprehensive analysis of the relationship between radical black activists across the prison walls. In doing so, it will inform historical understanding of African American prisoners' lives and deepen our appreciation of the complexities of black power.

The study revolves around three major themes. Firstly, it explores both the efforts of black power groups to recruit African American prisoners and the process by which they came to celebrate the penal system as a site and symbol of black resistance. This opens with the Nation of Islam, whose emphasis upon racial pride, self-help, and psychological transformation held great appeal to black convicts. Thus, the NOI established the basis for a more radical discourse on incarceration that emerged among such groups as the Black Panther Party and the Republic of New Afrika after 1966.

Secondly, the research will explore the process of prisoner radicalisation and place it within a wider history of prison race relations. It proposes that, while only a small number of black convicts openly engaged with black power activism, their politicisation was intimately related to the disintegration of the traditional racial order within America's penal system from the late 1950s; it was therefore the product of prison desegregation, a rising black political consciousness, and larger changes in law enforcement during this period. By looking to sociological research conducted during the 1960s, it will reveal how the growing numerical dominance of black prisoners empowered them to challenge their lowly status in prison society. This process was particularly acute in California, New York, and Illinois where penal institutions experienced an unprecedented level of racial violence and protest after 1968. Thus this study will reveal the connections between the black power movement, prisoners, black communities, and the criminal justice system.

A third theme is to consider official responses to this process of prisoner radicalisation. It is clear from prison wardens' reports that they considered the growing level of racial discontent inside their institutions to be a grave threat to their governance; they repeatedly connected these problems to the activities of radicalised black prisoners and black power groups outside the prison walls.

Finally, by forming a Race and Criminal Justice Research Group, the project will create an international, cross-disciplinary network of scholars whose research addresses matters of race, racism and criminal justice in the broadest sense. Networking events will draw together academics to share their research agendas and explore new collaborative relationships. A website, an edited collection of essays, and public lectures will disseminate this activity both within and beyond academia.

In conclusion, by illuminating the central role of prisoners and the penal system within radical black activist circles, this project promises to make a major contribution to the historiography of the black power movement, while also advancing academics' understanding of how race and racial identities impact upon criminal justice systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The formation of a Race and Criminal Justice Research Group will serve as the vehicle for ensuring this research has an impact beyond academia. The three groups of non-academic beneficiaries are non-specialist members of the public, non-academic professionals, and civil rights groups concerned with matters of racial equality and justice.

The School of Humanities Arts and Humanities Research Institute will facilitate public engagement by hosting visiting speakers associated with the Race and Criminal Justice Research Group. This will enable the dissemination of scholarly work to a non-specialist audience, while also demonstrating the broad importance of this work to challenges faced by black communities within Britain today. A potential contributor is criminologist and community activist Dr Martin Glynn at Birmingham City University, who has expressed an interest in being involved in this project. His research is exploring what the United Kingdom can learn from efforts within Baltimore's black community to reduce drug and gang activity, and how they can encourage black men to desist from criminal behaviour. Such research is of direct relevance to the challenges faced by communities in Britain today, and especially in light of the 2011 riots in Tottenham and elsewhere, which had a strong focus upon inner-city black communities. Dr Glynn's work has already been the focus of reports by the media, including the B.B.C. Thus, this impact activity will seek to promote public awareness and understanding of what is a highly topical and provocative issue within contemporary British society.

Secondly, in building upon scholarly interest in race and criminal justice, this project aims to have an influence upon the work of non-academic professionals and organizations involved in race relations, human rights, and legal reform. Two examples of this in the United States are the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union, both of which are actively campaigning for prison reform and efforts to stem the flow of poor, black men in to the nation's penal system. Michelle Alexander's study of black mass incarceration, &amp;quot;The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,&amp;quot; is an example of the way in which academic research has been used to support the work of these organizations. The Race and Criminal Justice Research Group will seek to emulate Alexander's influence beyond academia. In the first instance, this will be via the publication of an edited collection of essays as &amp;quot;Mass Incarceration in America: Histories, Cultures, and Communities.&amp;quot; This aims to push the boundaries of existing research by being the first study to draw together the historic, legal, and sociological dimensions of mass incarceration. In doing so, it aims to benefit both scholarly understanding of the phenomenon, and strengthen the research base upon which the work of organisations and legal professionals outside academia is based.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lecture by Robert King</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>851E1D81-EAD3-41AF-992B-1D5EEBB3E461</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lecture by prison reform activist and member of the Angola 3, Robert King.

Firstly, the politicisation of African American prisoners by the black power movement is just one part of a global history, where revolutionary movements have appropriated the prison as a powerful site and symbol of resistance. The infiltration of black power ideology into the penal system during the 1960s therefore needs to be understood as part of a larger historical phenomenon, where prisons have functioned as a site of political repression and radicalisation. Secondly, my research has built upon a long history of academic inquiry into the concept of the prison as a &amp;quot;total institution.&amp;quot; By studying the relationship between African American prisoners and the black power movement, I have developed a valuable case study for understanding the nature of prison society, inmates' capacity to shape the meaning of their incarceration, and their efforts to develop an identity that stretched beyond that of &amp;quot;criminal.&amp;quot; Finally, and most importantly, I propose that at the core of the African American prisoners' struggle was a battle against the prison system's central function: to break down an inmate's sense of self and effect psychological devastation. The immense power of the rehabilitative ideal in America during the post-World War II period reshaped criminal behaviour as a symptom of mental deficiency, where inmates could undergo rehabilitative &amp;quot;treatment.&amp;quot; Such judgments invariably equated rehabilitation with a submission to mainstream conceptions of racial behaviour and social values. Prisoners' resistance was founded upon a determination to preserve their mental integrity and an insistence that it was American society that needed &amp;quot;treatment.&amp;quot; Ultimately, therefore, my project has come to view African American prisoners' radicalisation as a battle for psychological liberation from mainstream definitions of race and criminality.

 During the course of the grant, I was also successful in establishing a research network that provided an organisational base for a programme of public and professional engagement. The first event was a two-day conference on political incarceration and human rights, which brought together academics from History, Law, Criminology, and Politics with representatives from the Danish Human Rights Institute and DIGNITY (Danish Institute Against Torture). One of the key themes that emerged from discussion between academics and representatives from the Danish Human Rights Institute and DIGNITY was the importance of directly engaging with prisoners, and how this can provide a unique insight into wider problems of social inequality. Building upon these conversations, I organised a one-day workshop on &amp;quot;hearing the hidden voice&amp;quot; of prisoners. The workshop centered on the discussion of three papers that were written and submitted by inmates at HMP Greenock for the purpose of the event. Jacci Stoyle attended the workshop as a representative of HMP Greenock. The events that I organised as part of the research network have opened up a number of potential collaborations with prison reform organisations, including Scottish PEN, which supports prisoners' writing projects, Positive Connections, which is a prison mentoring group, and the Presumed Innocent Network.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I envisage that my findings will be most useful to prison reform and human rights organisations who are seeking ways to engage with inmates, and particularly organisations that are seeking to offer educational opportunities to prisoners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6BA0972D-B9FA-474F-82BF-7D12C822A005</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e06f169af1a6.75219504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9CFD2E9-8D2C-4224-9DA9-487154CAF103</gtr:id><gtr:title>War without Terms: George Jackson, Black Power and the American Radical Prison Rights Movement, 1941-1971</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5b9c71bafbfe022ff808bd08dba7a23f"><gtr:id>5b9c71bafbfe022ff808bd08dba7a23f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colley Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>586e5398001a84.74225987</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F1C71F8-B298-4907-80C9-AFAF7783FF44</gtr:id><gtr:title>Erasing Minds: The Black Power Movement, Political Prisoners, and the Struggle Against Psychiatric Repression Inside America's Penitentiaries.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5adfdc5a0d4f3b65280d60e328fc793b"><gtr:id>5adfdc5a0d4f3b65280d60e328fc793b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Colley, Z A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>586e5a6c1d2e51.57397996</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L004488/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6147F869-528E-4716-B75D-1EEFD77024B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>American Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
