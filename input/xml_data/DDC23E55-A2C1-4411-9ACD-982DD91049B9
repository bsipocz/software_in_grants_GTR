Wales, stipulates changes to surface water management that will result in a greater
reliance on the infiltration of surface water to the ground ( e.g. via soakaways,
infiltration basins, permeable pavements). The proposed knowledge exchange aims
to increase the effectiveness of this public policy by exchanging knowledge with local
authorities and others, about the compatibility of the ground for infiltration. Central to
this knowledge exchange is a national dataset of subsurface suitability for infiltration,
developed by the British Geological Survey, which aims to increase adoption of good
practice. This knowledge exchange will focus on: i) disseminating NERC-science on
sustainable infiltration through conference sessions and seminars; ii) providing a
bridge between front-line staff, and academia and policymakers; iii) refining and
validating the BGS (NERC) national dataset through exchange of data and
experiences, and finally, iv) developing a web-based portfolio of infiltration-based
sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) that will demonstrate the opportunities for the
use of infiltration in a wide range of geological deposits.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This knowledge exchange fellowship provides a timely opportunity to
disseminate the BGS? decision-making framework and subsurface dataset as the
primary resource for assessing subsurface suitability for sustainable infiltration.
This fellowship aims to increase the effectiveness of new public policy during its
implementation, by providing a platform for a nationally consistent assessment,
which:
a) conveys a decision-making framework that guides the user through the
assessment process, thereby ensuring consistent evaluation of
subsurface properties
b) presents relevant, up-to-date, scientifically defensible, validated, 1:50 000
scale, GIS data, which can be used both by planners for the preliminary
design of infiltration SuDS, and by SuDS approval bodies for the
assessment of planning applications, and
c) contributes to the management and mitigation of risks associated with
flooding and water quality deterioration/ecosystem impact and associated
financial and environmental impacts.
The implementation of this framework and data is anticipated to have a positive
impact on decision-making for planners, developers, local authorities, SABs and
regulators. The legislation states that infiltration is the priority mechanism for
surface water management, however at present there is no accepted process by
which the suitability of the subsurface can be assessed and therefore it is our
intention to fulfil this knowledge gap. The aim is twofold: first to ensure that
opportunities for infiltration are realised and second, to ensure that infiltration is
Page 7 of 13
appropriate for the subsurface conditions and that infiltration system design is
compatible with the subsurface properties.
We envisage that the framework and dataset will provide a basis for planners
and developers to make decisions, but also for SuDS Approval Bodies to
scientifically scrutinise SuDS applications to ensure that infiltration is used where
practicable and is not used whereotentially hazardous. Through this
assessment, we anticipate that the use of the dataset will result in fewer
ineffective schemes and hence lower financial costs for Local Authority adopters.
This fellowship aims to communicate with users, to modify the developed dataset
and decision-making framework to be fit-for-purpose. We define a ?fit-forpurpose?
product as one that: facilitates decision-making; guides the assessment
process; allows efficient site assessment, and provides relevant, up-to-date,
validated data that is located in a single resource. Through this product
development process, we aim to decrease requirements for labour intensive
back-office services, whilst producing a consistent and reproducible output,
thereby having a positive economic and environmental impact.
This project commences prior to the implementation of the legislation (April-June
2012) and provides input during the key transitional period. It is anticipated that
this fellowship will therefore facilitate capacity building during this time. One-toone
meetings are likely to highlight areas where there are knowledge gaps or
where the newly implemented legislation is not working. The fellowship will
develop a knowledge network between front-line drainage staff, DEFRA and
academics, to enable resolution of such issues, with the overarching aim of
developing more effective public policy. Links to academia will be made through
personal connections, conference sessions and projects such as InformaTEC
and the methods by which front-line staff can contribute to science priorities will
be disseminated.
Through discussions with council representatives we are aware that the
versatility of infiltration is underestimated, suggesting that implementation may
not be maximised. We anticipate that this underestimation results from both
uncertainty with regards to the ground conditions and a lack of knowledge
concerning the range of infiltration systems available. Through the on
publication of a portfolio of infiltration systems, with the emphasis on subsurface
properties, and through one-to-one discussions, we hope to showcase design
solutions for a range of subsurface conditions, thereby tacitly changing attitudes
and thinking.
Through implementation of a scientifically defensible decision-making framework
and dataset, the fellowship will provide vital knowledge to front-line staff, who will
hence make better decisions. As a result, the installation of ineffective systems
that may lead to flooding, ground instability, or deterioration in groundwater
quality will be less likely. There is potential therefore, for the project to maintain
and enhance quality of life and health. In addition, the project will contribute to
better compliance with environmental regulations in particular the Water
Framework Directive.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Solutions to urban flooding, peatland carbon storage, Planet Earth Podcast.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B50250C-25D6-48DA-B3AE-8C74868193EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Podcast downloaded by public/scientists

The fellowship initially aimed to improve stakeholder knowledge of the Infiltration SuDS Map and hydrogeological implications of sustainable drainage. Through 70 individual meetings with local authorities and an addition 20 meetings with water companies and consultancies, awareness about the product was increased. This activity importantly provided an opportunity to gain insight into how stakeholders viewed BGS data and their onward requirements from it. As a result I developed a hugely improved understanding of stakeholder requirements and as a result have specified and developed a number of new products. Some of these products have been funded by BGS national capability funding, whilst others have attracted significant grants from the Technology Strategy Board and NERC. The ideas generated for new products are relevant to a wide variety of UK practitioners from construction, house building, ground investigation, water management, planning and agricultural backgrounds for example. 

The fellowship has also identified important new research questions and this has led to the establishment of a sustainable drainage system observatory in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings from the fellowships are continuously being taken forwards through submissions of further grants and using internal national capability funding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D79EC9AA-9E4E-4109-B39C-3F4F2767891D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5449056ba4fe87.81137970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Publication of a document indicating the potential for the use of surface water infiltration in London as an alternative to the Thames Tideway Tunnel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0A20DED-212C-46BB-9A7B-546E98FE4028</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Environment Agency used data provided to efficiently show that infiltration SuDS could not be an alternative to the Thames Tideway Tunnel.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5448f5fd329827.04640248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to DEFRA National Standards for Sustainable Drainage committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>807429AC-B949-462D-8E29-BCCB5AECFFAB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448f54c508768.46775395</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>As a result of communications during my KE fellowship, I realised that companies who work nationally could not access the Infiltration SuDS Map in a financially acceptable way.
