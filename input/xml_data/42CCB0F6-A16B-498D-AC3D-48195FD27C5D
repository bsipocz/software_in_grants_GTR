i) There has been little research - and no work on Germany - on the role of legislation in defining the norms and practices pertaining to modern marriage. Nonetheless, marriage has been at the core of governmental policies targeting the social sphere. It holds the potential to define societal norms, not only delineating 'insiders' from 'outsiders', but also securing the role of the state as the final arbiter in matters related to the family.

Germany, in particular, stands as an ideal optic into these issues. After it unified in 1871, Germany stood as a multi-ethnic empire; it consisted not only of a variety of culturally disparate regions, but it also included a heterogeneous domestic population, with substantial numbers of Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Poles - as well as numerous minority groups -, in addition to a growing overseas empire with a variety of further populations to administer. Moreover, it remained marked by its pre-unification heritage, with a variety of legal traditions across the German states, each of which dealt with issues related to marriage in a unique way. In addition, as a state at the very centre of Europe, its experiences in governing marriage were directly intertwined with those of neighbouring states, through cross-border migration, the transnational discussions of experts in a variety of disciplines and international treaties - the Hague Conference in 1902, for example, addressed the question of international standards for recognising what counted as 'marriage'. Finally, as a new country, Germany was in the midst of a process of intensive state building after national unification, and marriage was one of many issues which the state targeted in order to assert its hegemony over social and political life.

During the ECF, I would therefore examine debates about adopting the 1875 law on civil marriage - which stripped the right of churches from administering the sacrament in a way that was recognised by the state - and the everyday experiences of implementing the new policy as a case study for a broader issue: the role of - and limitations on - the state in dictating societal norms. In particular, I would focus on national debates in the public-political sphere as well as local and regional experiences with implementing the policy, examining three regional case studies as well as a number of transnational disputes that are particularly relevant for these issues. In this respect, this project speaks directly to the AHRC's current Highlight Notice on 'Translating Cultures', as it examines how Germany dealt with a variety of differing practices related to marriage throughout its vast and expanding empire.

With this study, I hope to lay the groundwork for a larger project, which I will develop after the conclusion of the ECF, on the relationship between marriage and the state in Imperial Germany from the 1870s until the outbreak of the First World War. I expect the ECF will enable me to develop my new research in this important domain by allowing me to undertake a pilot project towards what I anticipate will become my second academic monograph. By allowing me to pave the way for a substantial new research project, the fellowship would therefore contribute significantly to my academic profile, establishing me more confidently in the field of modern European history.

ii) Professionals and policy makers working on issues related to marriage law, as well as the broader public, have limited access to historical information on ideas about the role of legislation in defining the purposes and practices of marriage. I would like to increase awareness of the historical context and engage in dialogue with those currently working in professional and policy-making fields. Moreover, I would like to make my research available to a wider audience, shedding historical light on what remains a topical issue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study will contribute to a larger, book-length project on the history of regulating marriage in Imperial Germany. As such, it will provide an important basis for what will become the first comprehensive study of this crucial area of political, legal and social history. In this respect, the academic articles which I plan to submit to Central European History and German History will pave the way for a richer and more nuanced understanding of how states have attempted to govern social issues such as marriage and the family and how, in turn, citizens have responded to government policy. This research will therefore provide an important basis for understanding the role of marriage in state-citizen relations as well as understanding the role of marriage in charting the relations between states and non-native populations, including immigrants and members of overseas territories. Moreover, this study will lend historical insight to the international treatment of marriage through the creation of international treaties; the discussions of transnational networks of experts working in the area of marriage and the family; and, court cases that have tested the national bounds of laws on marriage. With these perspectives, this project has the potential to have an impact on current discussions amongst policy experts and political decision makers specialising in policies related to marriage, the family and the rights of citizens and aliens in these areas. To this end, I intend to give a public lecture linked to the research group History and Policy which will target an audience interested in current policy issues related to marriage and the family. In this respect, this research has the potential to spark new dialogue between academics and those involved directly in policy making.

Moreover, I intend to make this research accessible to an audience beyond academia and policy experts. First, I plan to make a podcast recording of the public lecture which I will give on the history of marriage regulation, with the goal of making my research more widely available to radio listeners throughout the UK. By making my research available to individuals working neither in academia nor in policy making, the podcast recording has the potential to show the wider relevance of historical study and to spark new interest in the important history of policies on marriage and the family. Second, I intend to write an article on the history of marriage regulation in modern Europe for publication in a popular journal such as History Today. In this respect, my research will have the potential to have an impact on students at GCSE- and A-level, both encouraging the further study of History at degree level and fostering a deeper understanding of contemporary debates related to policies on marriage the family.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61870</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Forging the Family, Imagining Society: Civil Marriage in Imperial Germany</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83BC87AC-7CC1-4A4A-AB1C-D73E77F4288C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar paper presented at the Free University, Berlin.

By shaping how families were formed across the new empire, the law aimed to create a common vision of German society. In doing so, the policy proved to be exclusionary, as it took up a specific understanding of what should constitute a family; who could have authority over it; and, whether and how marriages could be dissolved. As a consequence, marriage law proved enormously contentious throughout the four decades of the German Empire.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research has already received attention in non-academic contexts.
