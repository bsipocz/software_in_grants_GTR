Orangutans for example inhabit prime areas for agricultural expansion, timber extraction and palm oil plantations; bonobos inhabit areas of prolonged warfare and mountain gorillas inhabit areas that are crucial for minerals such as Coltan and for oil. If habitat destruction continues apace all great apes will be extinct in the wild within 20 years (World Conservation Union [IUCN]). 

In parallel with efforts to manage wild populations and habitats sustainably, modern zoos must form 'arks', to maintain viable populations of threatened species that can re-populate the wild if needed. This requires a step-change in our approach, to go beyond simply 'preserving' the animal for its genetic material to 'conserving the whole organism'- the behavioural traits and physical adaptations that are a vital part of what determines an animal's ability to survive in the natural environment.

Great apes are, however, some of the most difficult species to keep successfully in captivity. Health problems, such as obesity, are common, and some display aberrant behaviours and signs of stress, often related to a lack of relevant physical and mental activity. As stewards of these species for future generations, zoos need to be empowered with effective tools to ensure healthy, wild-type captive populations within a range of budgets.

That is what we are proposing: To devise an Enclosure Design Tool (EDT) that will enable zoos to develop independently effective strategies to ensure captive apes are able and motivated to express and maintain wild-type behaviours. In order to develop and validate the EDT, we will work with our project partner Twycross Zoo to apply our combined expertise on the behaviour of wild apes and management of captive apes to re-design their chimpanzee and gorilla enclosures.

This is much more than a simple enrichment plan. We will apply our knowledge of how animals deal with the demands of their natural habitat from locomotor, cognitive, social and cultural perspectives to design innovative, integrated wild-type enclosures. We will provide both the opportunity and incentive for wild-type behaviours, by exploiting the apes' motivation for one type of behaviour to encourage the expression of others. In the wild, all behaviours are strongly interlinked; by playing-on the relationship between them we can ensure that wild-type activity becomes a way of life for the animals, not a short-term novelty. The EDT will be innovative in that it will incorporate all of the core species-specific functional habitat requirements in one system. It will focus on replicating the mechanical and structural features of their habitats, not simply the aesthetics, and in relating it to data for wild animals, it will ensure the best fit for each species.

To our knowledge this partnership will be the first in the zoo community to draw on such a range of expertise to develop and release a stand-alone tool for future use by other zoos without academic input, and taking into account different budgets. Our advisory board will facilitate the dissemination of the EDT throughout the zoo community. This will improve the ability of UK and global zoos to act as true 'arks', and improve their financial situation by attracting more visitors to see animals behaving like their wild counterparts.

Our results can ultimately help inform those protecting and managing great apes environments in the wild by developing understanding of the core minimum elements needed to replicate natural environmental systems to support great ape wild-type behaviour, and support more successful reintroduction programmes by informed selections of possible habitats and better prepared apes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This innovation project is driven by impact and will have substantial economic and social impacts for our primary partner Twycross Zoo, for policy maker partner BIAZA, for the UK as a whole and ultimately for those managing the environments of great apes in range countries. These are described in detail in the Case for Support with pathway descriptions. A summary of key outcomes is provided below.

Key Benefits for Twycross Zoo (TZ):

1. Innovative housing and the associated improvements in the animals' activity levels and wild-type behavioural repertoire will enhance TZ's regeneration process (through enhanced reputation and status) and increase their economic status by attracting more visitors to see these popular animals. Such developments can lever corporate sponsorship. TZ will administer visitor questionnaires before and after the enclosure changes, to measure the impact of the project on visitor satisfaction (and thus financial impact), and will provide the academic team with this data for reporting.

2. The academics will transfer knowledge and expertise that TZ currently lacks in wild-type behavioural ecology to inform evidence-based enclosure design and management. This will facilitate the new Exec. Team's vision to catalyse cultural change within the organisation to be an international leader in captive management. The Enclosure Design Tool (EDT) will ensure the sustainability of the knowledge transfer by equipping TZ to implement an evidence-based approach independently for future developments.

Key Benefits for BIAZA

The EDT has the capacity to significantly enhance the UK's leadership in evidence-based management of great apes in captive habitats. The modularity and flexibility of the EDT make it applicable to both large and small scale habitat modifications, and can be used by non-experts, and is thus clearly advantageous for the numerous UK zoos without ready access to academics, or substantial funding for new enclosures. Its free availability to BIAZA members is therefore central to its success.

Key benefits to UK:

1. Zoos and aquariums are a growth sector that currently contribute &amp;pound;645 million in total activity to the UK economy and employs over 11,000 people, with visitors spending ca. &amp;pound;350 million per annum (BIAZA). Since active great apes are a primary attraction for zoo visitors, the project has the potential to enhance the UK's economic competitiveness in the tourism and culture sectors and contribute to sustained and/or improved employment.

2. The EDT also offers opportunities for linked enclosure architects and materials manufacturers to innovate alongside the findings of this project in order to manage the modifications that will be required in enclosure design and development, further enhancing the UK's position as an advanced materials and manufacturing hub.

In the long term the EDT can provide evidence to inform responsible management practice of environmental change in great ape range countries by:

1. developing user understanding of the core minimum elements needed to replicate natural environmental systems in order to support great ape wild-type behaviour, and support more successful reintroduction programmes by informed selections of possible habitats and better prepared apes.

2. building resilience to natural and anthropogenic habitat change by fulfilling the 'ark concept' and preparing species that have an important biological role in tropical forest for reintroduction, if required. Ensuring great ape sustainability in natural habitats preserves an essential natural resource with which to generate funding, catalyse cultural change and societal benefit and ensure the stewardship of natural resources for future generations.

To demonstrate the impact of this project we provide Letters of Support from example end users: Paignton Zoo and the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance that know our work and can best judge the value of the EDT we will produce for their fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96924</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BIAZA</gtr:description><gtr:id>539DF6D5-C60C-4159-94CF-B1FC154166A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary output is the Enclosure Design Tool, which is described elsewhere</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0061ade2a26.02199626-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>BIAZA are the representative body for UK zoos.

&amp;quot;The collaboration on the EDT project has had clear impacts for BIAZA in more than one way. The development of a tool that allows apes in our care to experience activity and locomotion more comparable to wild type behaviours allows us to achieve our goals of promoting wild type behaviours and developing strong protocols for high levels of care within our zoos. In addition, the relationship between the Birmingham University, Twycross Zoo and BIAZA is a clear model of how integrating disciplines can lead to beneficial partnerships with relevant outcomes for the professional bodies and for the academic partners involved&amp;quot;.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Twycross Zoo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Twycross Zoo</gtr:description><gtr:id>4063EC39-7104-40A1-8C4D-F4871AB3CEE0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our partnership led to a series of events exploring wider collaboration across the operations and expertise of UoB and Twycross Zoo. We ran a Discovery Day at Twycross that was attended by &amp;gt;20 leading researchers from 5 Colleges with the University of Birmingham. To date this has led to formal collaborations developing between Twycross Zoo and the Birmingham Business School (http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/business/news/2015/july/marketing-and-monkeys.aspx) and the School of Psychology, and others are in development. The two institutional partners signed an MOU in 2016. The partnership has been featured extensively by both institutions as a flagship industry/academia partnership, such as the 'Business with Birmingham' conference in 2015, where the CEO of Twycross Zoo sat on the panel with large corporates such as Jaguar Land Rover, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, and IBM, and features in the Business with Birmingham 'Think' magazine e.g.:http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/partners/Think-Business-10.pdf</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d08ebb5bc2e2.66914334-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Twycross zoo allowed us access to their animal facilities and to their staff at all levels of the organisation in order to develop the Enclosure Design Tool. They allocated us office space and provided access to their library and parking facilities for free, plus free access to the zoo. They modified enclosures as we have suggested and allocated significant staff time to this process. Further they have made bridges for us with regulatory bodies (EU great Ape Taxon Advisory Group [TAG}), and facilitated our speaking at the next EU TAG meeting in April. From an institutional perspective they had been extremely strong ambassadors for the benefits of industry interacting with the University of Birmingham and their CEO (Sharon Redrobe) has spoken at key University of Birmingham events such as 'Business with Birmingham, 2015 to this effect.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have been seconded to Twycross zoo and are using their chimpanzee and gorilla enclosures as a case study from which to develop the Enclosure Design Tool. Our work to record the locomotor, cognitive and social behaviour of their chimps and gorillas will significantly improve the welfare of their animals by providing bespoke evidence-based modifications to their enclosures based on comparisons with the behaviour of wild animals. This process gives the zoo direct access to the latest research on wild chimpanzees and gorillas, which is rarely accessible to zoos either because of lack of proximity to relevant academics or because the way the research is described makes it difficult to extract meaningful translational information. For example very little is know about the behaviour of wild lowland gorillas because there are very few habituated populations. Interpreting the literature thus requires understanding of the behaviour of wild apes and the likely impact of lack of habituation. 

Moreover, our study contributes substantially to their vision - which is to be a research-led Zoo, particularly in care and welfare of primates.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Great Ape TAG talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C88E66A0-724D-4998-8861-E6303865CAC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation introducing the Enclosure Design Tool to the greaty Ape Taxon Advisory Group (TAG), This is the EU regulatory body, under the auspices of EAZA (European Association of Zoos and Aquaria), that is responsible for all aspects of the management and welfare of captive great apes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b99851601611.16760875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BIAZA talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8591C2F1-7435-405C-888B-68D0947C40A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation to BIAZA's annual research conference entitled 'An Enclosure Design Tool to enable zoos to create integrated, wild-type enclosures for great apes'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b99797df6e90.38999844</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Delivery of Twycross Zoo's Conservation Welfare Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD751EC8-4796-4DCF-A4A5-EFB61ED1EFBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The title of the talk was 'Aping the apes: translating wild great ape research to zoos'.

The keepers made substantial changes and we are now repeating the data collection procedure to establish whether those changes have had a beneficial effect on the chimpanzees locomotor, manipulative, social and undesirable behaviours. Preliminary observations suggest that the modifications have worked. This process has been complemented by our formation of an Advisory Board who are helping us ensure the project is relevant to all UK zoos and beyond to other user groups, such as the managers of chimpanzee/gorilla rehabilitation and reintroduction programmes in range countries.

In addition Thorpe has sat on the Design Team's bi-weekly Meetings for Twycross Zoo's new chimpanzee enclosure since November last year acting as a Research Adviser for eliciting wild type behaviours. She will continue to do so until its completion next summer. 

Other developments:
Invitation to speak at the EU Great Ape TAG (Taxon Advisory Group) midyear meeting in April. This is the regulatory body and our aim is that we can obtain their approval for the enclosure design tool and that it becomes built into their recommendations.

We have also been asked to speak at BIAZA's Annual Research meeting in June and will be invited to the parliamentary reception they will host in July. BIAZA are the representative body for UK Zoos.
