Yet there has been no recent comprehensive general study of this vast output, and those those that do exist have been constrained by concentration on a single aspect - on only part of the century or one author, and by a preoccupation with the academic question of definition of the genre. But readers do not read stories in order to define them: they read them because stories have tales to tell, points to make, lessons and pleasures to give. This project, for a book entitled 'Telling Tales: Short Fiction in Nineteenth-Century France', will explore the centrality and importance of nineteenth-century short fiction - to ask what themes and means it used, why and how it mattered, and how it was produced, read, and received. Stepping outside the academic question of definition, it will ask why definition became so important, and what that tells us about the status and role of stories, their changing position and importance in the century, and why and in what ways definition should have become a significant means of institutional ideological control. Exploring and celebrating the diversity of French nineteenth-century short fiction via the study of eight broadly chronological but also synchronic fields, it will track the nature, uses and abuses of short fiction throughout the century, and suggest that, so far from being definable (as conventional academic studies imply), it is the very irreducibility and undefinability of short fiction which renders it so vibrant, and which, in fact, 'defines' it, via the endless burgeoning of alternative narrative voices, views, and viewpoints, which characterizes it as the genre which refuses to be silenced or pinned down. In this way, the project will conduct a critical enquiry on the canon of nineteenth-century short fiction, expanding the range of authors and short texts studied,or specialists, students, and general reader alike.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28453</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The broad scope of the initial project, covering the long French nineteenth century from 1793 to 1905, and considering French short fiction not just in terms of form but also of historical and ideological context has led to a wide range of impacts. In addition to the scholarly outputs listed, Its consideration of short fiction in relation to poetry has led to conference papers and articles on Baudelaire and Poe given in France, the US and Russia, the treatment of Zola to lectures given to general readers audiences for the Emile Zola Society of London and to an audience of 16-19 year olds and their teachers at the William Morris Sixth Form College in Hammersmith with the aim of encouraging University Access, as well as to scholarly audiences worldwide. The forthcoming Cambridge Companion to Balzac, is intended for students and general readers; the Everyman edition of three novels by Verne, intended for a similar constituency has led to a second, related invitation. Forthcoming projects include papers on Sand and nineteenth-century women's literature and nineteenth-century short fiction and the press.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C3DF9BC7-5188-4738-A070-428079F6147F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54639ec63d01d3.51027236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Telling Tales: Short Fiction in nineteenth-century France has revealed a far richer mine of material than first anticipated. The range of the initial eight-chapter project, covering the whole of the nineteenth century and beyond (1793-1905), has been largely covered in the drafts produced so far, but has resulted in the identification of key fault-lines in the publishing, political and genre history of the period which structure three projected studies aiming to cover the whole of the initial 1793-1905 period, now too vast to be accommodated in one or even two volumes. Volume 1, covering 1793-1836, retains the original title, Telling Tales: but with a changed subtitle, Short Fiction in nineteenth-century France, Napoleon to Gautier. The study has built more than initially anticipated on my earlier Balzac's Shorter Fictions, in terms of the greater than expected importance of publishing and cultural, political and intellectual history and of other genres. It proposes a radical re-reading of short fiction in nineteenth-century France whose implications are still fully to be revealed, away from formalism, towards content, corresponding to a fundamental structuring dynamic in the intellectual and cultural history of nineteenth-century France, with key pivotal points at 1836 and 1863, and exploring the relationship with other genres (the novel, drama, but also prose poetry). It draws on canonical figures, authors and texts, but establishes new relationships, lines of force and centres of interest. In particular, it aims to resituate literary communities whose significance has since been somewhat eclipsed, reminding us of the fundamental importance of publishing practicalities and practice. It sees short fiction as a major popular genre, but also as an important mode of resistance, ending the period up to the mid-1830s with a series of works including Gautier's Nuit de Cl?op?tre and Fortunio, Mademoiselle de Maupin and Balzac's La Fille aux yeux d'or, which literally 'tournent court' or 'fall short', refusing the in extenso treatment and commercial vulgarization of the serial novel. This first volume anticipates the other major structuring movements in nineteenth-century short fiction, to be treated in volume two, covering the period from the inception of serialization to the end of the Second Empire; a third volume will cover the remainder of the century from 1870-1904. The project thus aspires to a radical and comprehensive treatment of what has been hitherto considered as a minor genre, appealing to scholars and general readers interested in French and other short fiction, and corresponding to the growing contemporary interest in storytelling as a fundamental mode of discourse and of being.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work should inform that of other scholars and students in the area, but also general readers and also potentially those in culture, media and the arts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FF565D69-BDA7-4FCD-ABD0-3AAB935481B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a6839390f5.92003763</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4129F8A8-92FA-45B9-9D51-0822935E802B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Daudet and the perils of the popular</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51c507ed3e6db2068029f124d2afb5f9"><gtr:id>51c507ed3e6db2068029f124d2afb5f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Timothy Farrant (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_255797986613a42cc6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H00274X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
