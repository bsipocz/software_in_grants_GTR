One of the qualities that makes these manuscripts so captivating - their coloration - is also a precious source of knowledge. 

Manuscripts were central to learning, culture, belief, and art in Britain from the seventh century to the fifteenth. The ways in which they were made - first in monasteries, then by paid professionals in urban centres - reflect both the roles that they fulfilled, and the materials and technologies that were available at that time and place. As inks and pigments were fundamental to writing and illuminating, they helped to determine the forms of book culture and played a formative role in the evolution of pictorial art. Differing in type (organic, mineral, alchemical) and availability (some made from local materials, others relying on long-distance trade), pigments varied considerably in cost, with practical and symbolic implications for how they were used and perceived. Nevertheless, reliable information about them is currently very limited: the origin, nature, and deployment of the pigments used by scribes and illuminators during the nine centuries in question are unwritten chapters of British cultural, bibliographical, scientific, and artistic history.

There is very little work of enduring value on these pigments, owing to a series of practical difficulties. Manuscripts are dispersed around museums and university and cathedral libraries across the country. There is (rightly) a moratorium on taking samples from medieval and renaissance manuscripts: they are fragile, and too valuable. Any investigation must be undertaken by non-invasive, non-destructive means. The technology to accomplish this task has existed since the 1980s, but work to date has been piecemeal and extremely limited because of the expense and size of the equipment, and because of conservation restrictions and high insurance costs that debar the moving of precious manuscripts to laboratories. However, new conservation approved techniques, and modern, mobile instrumentation mark a step-change in equipment mobility, and in accuracy of results. The current equipment, much of which has been developed as bespoke, dedicated tools by the team, has set new benchmarks in security, sensitivity, and spatial resolution. The proven high performance, mobile resources at the disposal of the present team, its joint manuscript-chemistry-physics expertise, and its collective experience in examining manuscripts in pilot studies funded by Durham and Cambridge Universities, mean that this hitherto impracticable project has now become feasible. This project combines unique historical, curatorial, and scientific skillsets to identify the pigments of medieval manuscripts without damaging them.

The team will identify the pigments in a broad, carefully chosen selection of ca. 200 manuscripts. These range in date from the seventh to the fifteenth centuries; they represent a cross-section of the major centres of production; and they include books that have a known origin and provenance and that can, therefore, act as a fiducial point for a time and place. From this information, the team (and other scholars) will be able to analyse: patterns of cultural, social, and economic interaction between regions and scribal centres; the use of local materials and the movement of trade; reasons for changes in pigments; innovations by illuminators to overcome technological limitations; the interplay of cost, technology, and artistic practice.

The principal outcome will be the first scientific account of the pigments of British illuminated manuscripts as a whole, which will be the fundamental work of reference for future research in the field; with additional benefits in training and providing reliable information to museums, archives, conservators, and their audiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 3 main strands of impact will be professional curatorial and conservation practices; the transformative use of technology; and public understanding of art and science.
1. Curation and conservation for the 21st century
The impact from this strand will be on curatorial and conservation practices, with likely effects on archival or institutional policy, in the areas of training and the use of technology. Curatorial staff will benefit from new knowledge about the nature and composition of the materials used to make the most valuable items in their care. Conservators responsible for preserving these collections will benefit from more accurate identification of particular materials and experience of the newest technologies of pigment identification. In our pilot project work, Raman spectroscopy has already revealed that a type of degradation typically diagnosed 'by eye' as characteristic of red lead is also a feature of vermilion. 
Throughout the research programme, we will organize collaborative advisory sessions for conservation staff. These sessions will be a standard feature of our site visits at which research analysis is undertaken. There will be continuous on-site interaction with relevant keepers and conservators, explaining the technology, sharing findings on the manuscripts, and discussing the interpretation. We will make a broader presentation of our findings to the library and academic community as a whole during the final year of the project through a conference organized under the aegis of AMARC (Association for Manuscripts and Archives in Research Collections), the leading association of professionals involved with such material.
2. Techniques, Technology, and Transforming Practice
The project will disseminate awareness of, and best practice in the use of, modern non-invasive technologies. The research process goes hand-in-hand with the continual development of equipment and introduction of emerging technologies, in order to increase their portability, suitability, and capability specifically for in situ work with fragile manuscripts. The project will disseminate its results and processes - of relevance to scientists as well as to anyone involved in caring for books and documents - through display sessions and publicity releases. Principal Investigator Gameson and Co-Investigators Beeby and Nicholson undertook such sessions, which provide a model for the proposed activities, for the Institute of Conservation at the Wellcome Institute, London, in January 2016 and for the Association of Archivists at Wembley in September 2016. 
3. Illuminating the Public
The most-frequently asked question by the 100,000+ visitors to the 2013 'Lindisfarne Gospels' exhibition in Durham was: 'what was used to make the colours of the exhibited manuscripts, still so vivid after 1,400 years?' The third impact strand is the presentation to the general public of the illuminated manuscripts explored during the research phases of the project. The project will work closely with the planned major exhibition, 'The Lindisfarne Gospels and the Glories of Britain's Greatest Medieval Library', to be held in Durham in 2020 as the planned successor to 'Lindisfarne Gospels Durham'. A substantial section will be devoted to the pigments of the manuscripts on display and the techniques used to identify them, and to the technological, artistic, and historical implications of the proposed research project. This theme will be central to the associated programme of public lectures and guided visits (coordinated by Gameson) and will be part of a school education programme (directed by Dr Sarah Price at Palace Green Library). Dr Price and her team saw no fewer than 10,000 children in association with the 2013 exhibition. Drawing on the expertise developed in the course of recent exhibitions, the Palace Green Library team will devise visitor surveys and elements of the education programme to record changes in understanding as a result of the exhibition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>417633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R001545/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
