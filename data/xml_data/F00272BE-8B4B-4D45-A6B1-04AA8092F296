The project will investigate several of these open problems.The most famous problem in the area of nil algebras is the Koethe Conjecture, first posed in 1930, which asserts that if a ring has no nonzero nil ideals then it has no nonzero nil one-sided ideals. This is a fundamental question about the general structure of rings, and a thorough understanding of nil and nilpotent rings is necessary for any serious attempt to understand general rings. Related problems concerning nil rings will be one of the main themes of this project. The Fellow has already made fundamental contributions to this area, including the construction of a simple nil algebra over any countable field.The most famous problem about algebraic algebras is the Kurosh Problem which asks whether the knowledge that a finitely generated algebra is algebraic over a base field is sufficient to ensure that the algebra is finite dimensional. This is untrue in general, as demonstated by Golod and Shafarevich in 1964. However, many partial positive results are known, and a second main theme of the project is to clarify the borderline between positive and negative solutions of the Kurosh Problem. There are close connections between this theme and the previous theme: for example, the Golod-Shafarevich algebras are infinite dimensional nil algebras that are not nilpotent.The third main theme is the growth of algebras, and, in particular, a study of algebras with restricted growth. The Fellow has already made a fundamental contribution to this area in proving the Artin-Stafford Gap Theorem, which asserts that there are no graded domains with growth strictly between 2 and 3.A substantial part of the third theme will be to investigate the problems arising in the first two themes under restrictions on the growth of the algebras. For example, the Golod-Shafarevich algebra has exponential growth, but the Fellow has recently produced a examples with (relatively) small growth. The exact limits on the growth conditions in many of the open problems will be investigated in the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>395658</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1406551</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Advanced Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Research Council (ERC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>320974</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C9411BFA-BA31-42AD-8046-AF15E902166E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bddefda8986.13940602</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As a result of this work I have been awarded several important prizes and invitations, for example the European Mathematical Society prize 2010 and an invited talk at the International Congress in Mathematics in Madrid 2006.

Beneficiaries: UK Universities, and UK scientific reputation worldwide.

During the grant many open questions in noncommutative ring theory were solved and new methods of constructing rings satisfying prescribed relations were obtained. Also methods of establishing the growth of algebras were invented and methods of constructing algebraic algebras with small growth.

Beneficiaries: The primary beneficiaries of the work are researchers in noncommutative algebra and closely related areas. Secondary beneficiaries are mathematicians working in other areas such as group theory and the combinatorics of words, and in any area where growth</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>37B89488-C2C7-4266-A28D-11266A6449C7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>m-4249962395.289878de244552</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Noncommutative rings are the fertile meeting grounds for many areas of mathematics and physics, as noted by T.Y.Lam in his book 'A first course in noncommutative rings'. The project Investigated the structure of noncommutative rings, especially nil rings, Golod-Shafarevich algebras and rings appearing in noncommutative algebraic geometry. Nil rings are rings in which every element to some power is zero. They are related to torsion groups and were used for solving the General Burnside Problem in Group theory. Nil rings are algebraic and Jacobson radical. The Jacobson radical plays a crucial role in the study of the general structure of rings. Key results related to nil rings obtained under the grant: 1. Solution of the Makar-Limanov conjecture by constructing nil algebras which, after extending the base field, contain noncommutative free subalgebras in two generators. 2. Constructing finitely generated, infinite dimensional nil algebras with the smallest known growth; these algebras have approximately n&amp;sup2; elements of degree n, linearly independent over the base field, for almost all n. 3. Providing the first example of Jacobson radical not nil algebras with the smallest possible growth, that is the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two (it is known that the Jacobson radical algebras with the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension less than two are nil). Another idea investigated using the grant was Golod-Shafarevich algebras, answering open questions by Field's medallist Efim Zelmanov. An algebra is called Golod-Shafarevich if the number of generating relations of each degree is not large, and they were used to solve the Tower of fields conjecture in Number Theory, the General Burnside Probelm in Group theory and the Kurosh Problem in noncommutative algebra. It is known that Golod-Shafarevich algebras have exponential growth; I have shown that there are Golod-Shafarevich algebras whose infinite dimensional homomorphic images have exponential growth. Later, together with L. Bartholdi I showed that if the number of defining relations of each degree is polynomially bounded then such Golod-Shafarevich algebras have homomorphic images of polynomial growth. This shows that there are algebras with polynomial growth which satisfy the prescribed relations, under mild assumptions about the number of defining relations of each degree.Algebras related to noncommutative projective geometry were also investigated. In particular, the structure of domains with quadratic growth which have a non trivial derivation was completely determined, showing that the Artin proposed classification of domains holds for rings with derivations. In addition, in a collaborative effort I used algebraic methods in the area of numerical linear algebra as follows. In many practical applications, e.g. arising in solving differential equations numerically, we need to solve a linear system of equations Ax=b where A is a nonsingular matrix with a special block structure. Very often the block matrices A(i,j) are sparse and many of them are zero. Numerical algorithms ought to exploit the structure of the matrix A. The numerical properties of solutions of a nonsingular system of linear equations Ax=b , with A partitioned into blocks, were studied using a classical iterative refinement (IR) algorithm and a k-fold iterative refinement (RIR) algorithm, using only single precision. We proved that RIR has superior numerical quality to IR.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>by other scientist who would continue a research on simlilar
