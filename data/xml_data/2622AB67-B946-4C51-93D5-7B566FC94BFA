They are involved in co-ordinating almost all the body s functions and their deregulation is a cause or consequence of many diseases. For this reason, kinases have become the major drug targets of the 21st Century. Ten drugs that prevent particular kinases from working have been approved for clinical use and have had a huge impact on the treatment of cancer, including one drug that essentially cures a form of leukaemia that previously was rapidly fatal. The purpose of this application is to obtain funding to maintain and improve a novel service that has been set up by the MRC Unit that I direct and which has proved to be of great value in speeding up the development of drugs in this area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Protein kinases have become the most studied class of drug target, with 30% of the R&amp;amp;D effort of the pharmaceutical industry now devoted to this topic. The challenge is to develop drugs that inhibit just one or at most a few of the 500 protein kinases encoded by the human genome. To assist this process, the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit (MRC-PPU) introduced the idea of kinase profiling in which the specificities of hits identified by screening compound collections are rapidly profiled against a panel that currently comprises 80 protein kinases. This service has proved to be of critical importance to the pharmaceutical industry, has spawned a spin-out company in Dundee (the Upstate division of Millipore) that employs 70 people and created a new industry worth #200 million per annum worldwide. In recent years, the number of academic researchers operating drug discovery programmes has increased enormously and the kinase profiling service of the MRC-PPU has become vital in providing an affordable service for these organisations. The purpose of the application is therefore to provide the funding needed to set up a National Protein Kinase Profiling Centre for the academic community, MRCT and other organisations. Without such support the service to these users will not continue, because the pharmaceutical companies with whom the MRC-PPU collaborate and who have funded the service so far, now wish the funding for this resource to be used by the MRC-PPU to develop new services that are not yet commercially available.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Merck</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Merck Serono</gtr:department><gtr:description>DSTT renewal 2016</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0E3A702-B357-4FF7-8952-6577FF2BD133</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

Waldenstrom's lymphoma is caused by mutations in the protein MyD88, and 95% of the patients who are afflicted by this disease express the same mutant in which the leucine residue at position 265 is changed to proline. MyD88 is an essential adaptor protein in the signalling networks that are triggered by the binding of bacterial and viral components to Toll-Like Receptors or by the interaction of interleukins 1, 18 and 33 with their receptors.


Philip's talk to an audience that mainly comprised patients with Waldenstrom's lymphoma, their physicians, relatives and friends, focused on how MyD88 was discovered, and its key role in the innate immune system that is vital for protection against infection by microbial pathogens, especially during childhood. He also explained how the hyper-activation of the MyD88-dependent signalling network can lead to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, and how its constitutive activation caused by the MyD88[Leu265Pro] mutation leads to lymphoma. The talk was followed by a formal dinner in the Churchill rooms, at which Philip and Tricia Cohen were the guests of honour.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54205d609e4da6.54660185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Student's important protein discovery could help fight cancer</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>218F8B72-CA2C-4B92-AA06-94ADFD3BA5D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jiazhen Zhang, a research student in Professor Sir Philip Cohen's laboratory at the University of Dundee, has uncovered how the protein complex, called NF-?B, is activated.

The letter, coordinated by Sir David Carter, a former chief medical officer in Scotland, said Scottish universities did disproportionately well out of the UK's research funding system and from the UK's charitable and medical foundation grants.
