Most patients present with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic disease and despite advances in treatment median survival at this stage remains low. While new therapies for the treatment of advanced lung cancer are showing promising results recent studies suggest that tumours harbouring Kras mutations (30-50% of non-small cell lung cancers) may be particularly difficult to treat. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at Kras mutant lung tumours are urgently in need. Our lab is interested in the mechanisms responsible for the progression of lung tumours harbouring Kras mutations. By understanding the processes that enable tumours to develop we aim to find new vulnerable points for therapeutic intervention. Using mouse lung tumour models we recently showed that a Kras-mutation is sufficient to drive the initial expansion of tumour cells but progression to malignancy is associated with the acquisition of new mutations. We will now identify these additional requirements by mapping all mutations associated with benign and malignant disease using state-of-the-art whole genome sequencing technology. Furthermore, we will test the relevance of such mutations for tumour progression in vivo using mouse lung tumour models. Finally, we will use our models to test the therapeutic potential of targeting these mutations in established lung tumours with mutant Kras.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Ras/MAPK-signalling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation and cell survival and is frequently deregulated in human cancer. Kras missense mutations (codons 12, 13 and 61) are particularly prevalent in lung, pancreas and colon tumours and result in the accumulation of constitutively active, GTP-bound Kras protein. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Most patients present with locally advanced inoperable or metastatic disease and despite advances in treatment median survival at this stage remains low. While targeted therapies for the treatment of advanced lung cancer are showing promising results recent studies suggest that tumours harbouring Kras mutations may pose an increased therapeutic challenge by failing to respond to anti-EGFR therapies. With no currently available Ras-targeted therapies and limited success targeting other pathway members, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at these tumours are urgently in need. Our lab is interested in the molecular mechanisms responsible for lung tumour progression in the presence of a Kras-mutation and in using pre-clinical models to establish the therapeutic potential of targeting such evolutionary requirements in established tumours. To identify and pre-clinically validate novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these tumours we start by generating genetically modified mouse models in which human lung tumour development can be closely recapitulated. Using such regulatable models we characterize the spontaneous mutations that accompany each stage of tumour evolution and in parallel, test the impact of acute genetic changes in disease progression and tumour maintenance. Our recent data indicate that Kras oncogenic activation is sufficient to drive tumour initiation but an increase in Ras/MAPK-pathway signalling is required for malignant progression. In turn, p53 activation (and its counter-selection) is only triggered by this secondary increase in Ras/MAPK signalling and is therefore absent in benign stages of disease. One of our major goals is to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for malignant progression in KrasG12D-driven lung tumours. To achieve this we are carrying out a genome-wide screen in laser-captured tumour material in collaboration with Dr. David Adams (Sanger Institute). Next-generation sequencing and copy number data from low grade and high grade lung tumour areas (from individual tumours) will be compared to identify potential biomarkers and novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our second aim is to develop new switchable mouse models to test the impact of candidate mutations in lung tumour evolution and their potential as therapeutic targets. Presently, we are developing new models to test the role of p53 mutations and Kras copy number changes in tumour progression and maintenance. Our future goal is to develop regulatable mouse models of promising therapeutic targets identified in our screen in order to model their therapeutic potential in KrasG12D lung tumours.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1824000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Cancer Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>Lung cancer metabolic analysis</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A4EB017-BEAA-4932-99A5-A5E90F069FAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaborative project already resulted in a publication:

All students, accompanied by their teachers, were given a tour of the enitre building with an opportunity for engaging with researchers about the state of the art in cancer research and gaining hands-on experience with setting up experiments. Talks about career opportunities and challenges associated with pursuing cancer research were also available to all attendees. The event sparked a great deal of interest and enthusiasm in students and teachers alike and we have had a request for this event to be continued. We will be pursuing a similar format of activities for the MRC Science Festival in 2017, but reach out to more number of schools, including those outside of Cambridge city perimeters.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a339da710dd8.06636506</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://mrccancerunit.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cancer-researchers-the-mrc-cancer-unit-open-day-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in Cambridge University Science Festival (2015-2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F708613C-74C5-4A42-8384-50D5C3E69F6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Cambridge Science Festival, organised to coincide with National Science Week, aims to reach out to the general public and communicate about the different aspects of science and research being undertaken at the University. It is a free event, over two weeks, with an excess of 270 events and more than 30000 attendees. As part of this, the MRC CU along with the CRUK CI organised a set of talks and activities that were attended by over 100 people from all walks of life - from young children and young adults to parents/carers and professionals. The Martins lab was part of the MRC CU team at this event. The overall event generated a lot of interest in cancer research, helped raise awareness about the importance of 'early' in cancer which is the mission of the MRC CU and also led to a lot of interest being generated in the MRC Festival of Science which followed on later in the year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a33a55a7b784.56000010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public engagement talk at Perse school , Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C2F5820-3266-4060-BAE4-FA0FD4ABC115</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk about DNA and cancer was given to year groups 3 and 4 at the Perse Primary School, CAmbridge with a view to giving young children an idea about basic biology as part of the school's own Science Festival.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6eb916f7eb0.79403277</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Exploiting the metabolic heterogeneity of mutant Kras lung tumours to optimize therapy</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Lori Monroe Scholarship in Translational Lung Cancer Research, LCFA</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>6DADBFED-7A84-4DA7-A052-1631FA346D85</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d96e919589.68576961</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ACT Cancer Research Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4E18812D-D134-43BC-B297-E617CD591117</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6d53986024.44607690</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We generated microarray data from cells that are either homozygous or heterozygous for mutant Kras, one of the most common mutations in human cancer.</gtr:description><gtr:id>52600A40-6A0C-4F66-BE80-0FF71C2FDBD8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on this dataset we were able to demonstrate that Kras mutant tumours are heterogeneous and display distinct therapeutic sensitivities, depending on mutant Kras copy content (Kerr et al, Nature 2016).
