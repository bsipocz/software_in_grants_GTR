Every effort is made to reduce this huge energy consumption by exchanging heat between the input and output streams to the distillation tower in a train of heat exchangers commonly referred to as the crude preheat train . Unfortunately, crude oil contains components which lead to drastic fouling of the heat exchangers in the crude preheat train. Such fouling leads to enormous costs, not only in the costs of loss of energy recovery but also in the costs of loss of product and mitigation measures. In the USA alone, preheat train fouling is estimated to cost around $1.2 billion per annum. The most important components causing fouling are the asphaltenes, which are complex polynuclear aromatic compounds which carry most of the trace element content of the crude oil. Though the importance of the problem has led to a large amount of work being done, this has not led to an understanding of the processes of ashphalene transport and deposition. What is proposed is a study (carried out by a multi-disciplinary team) which covers the scales from molecular to plant systems. The first step is to understand more precisely the asphaltene contents and compositions in crude oil and deposits (Sub-Project A). Using nano-rheoemetry, the interfacial behavior of the depositing species can be studied (Sub-Project B). Using the information on chemical and physical properties of asphaltenic materials, modelling structures can be developed both of the molecular properties (Sub-ProjectD) and of the heat and mass transfer effects (Sub-Project C ). It is an essential part of the project to carry out actual measurements on fouling and the plan is to make such measurements using a small scale (rotating cell) apparatus (Sub-Project E) and an annulus flow facility simulating heat exchanger conditions (sub-Project G). Finally, technology transfer will be achieved through participation of ESDU International Ltd. in the project (Sub-Project H); ESDU has close contacts with the refining industry and is already developing software which is used by this industry and into which the key results of the project can be subsumed to ensure rapid take-up by the companies involved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256268</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Imperial College London</gtr:description><gtr:id>1364D130-E257-4011-B2EF-E9F94336950D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications - see else where.

Proof of concept was demonstated, fundamental principles understood and a prototype constructed.

We demonstrated that fluid dynamic gauging could be peformed in fast moving liquids and constructed a prototype (but the project ended before it could be commissioned). The device operated in a new mode, which can be used for other high pressure systems (e.g. membranes) and also at very low pressures. This capability has been exploited in subsequent projects studying fouling, cleaning and surface testing.

Beneficiaries: Academic research groups, Industrial R&amp;amp;D, industrial manufacturing

Contribution Method: The project confirmed that fluid dynamic gauging could be peformed reliably in flowing systems in annular geometries and other configurations. The expertise developed was exploited in other projects. The high pressure and high temperature design specification led to novel approaches to sealing and mechanical design. Numerical simulation of the flow fields also highlighted key fluid mechanics aspects.

In this phase of the Crude Oil Fouling Project, our task was to construct a numerical simulation of the operation of refinery preheat trains incorporating the dynamics introduced by fouling and cleaning. This simulation was then used to identify the best schedule of cleaning operations, to support cleaning-based fouling mitigation strategies. The simulation was designed to be flexible, robust, and capable of being expanded to include control aspects and also to be used in retrofitting studies. We also expanded the modelling approach to include deposit ageing.

We developed a numerical simulation tool can be used to analyse the thermal peformance of crude oil refinery preheat trains subject to fouling, to optimise cleaning operations including complex control aspects, subject to a range of different cost and environmental impact structures. 



The potential was demonstrated with a series of industrial case studies where plant operating data sets were used to generate local fouling models, demonstrating the potential to apply these methodology to any refinery (as these plants are all different). Substantial cost and carbon dioxide savings are achievable.

Beneficiaries: Academic research; industrial researcher; oil refinery operators: other heat transfer applications;

Contribution Method: We developed appropriate calculation approaches for modelling the sets of equations describing network heat transfer, fouling dynamics, the optimisation problem associated with scheduling cleaning operations and the inclusion of control issues. A key aspect was the development of robust algorithms. 

A substantial body of industrial fouling data was processed and new insights into fouling behaviour, particularly that associated with ageing, was identified.

The simulation also allows fouling to be considered at the network design and retrofit stages, which is important for building flexiblity into oil refinery operations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>197B50F0-DFDA-4B2F-8378-9892D96CA13E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-3582234590.856577de2451dc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Fouling of heat exchangers causes losses in energy transfer, reduced throughput and can cause loss of process integrity. The Crude Oil Fouling Project was a collaboration between Bath, Imperial and Cambridge supported by industry and considered different aspects of crude oil fouling in order to develop mitigation routes based on fundamental understanding.



The Cambridge work focused on (i) developing numerical methods for determining plant-scale cleaning strategies and (ii) developing a fluid dynamic gauging device for working with crude oil at high temperature and pressure. 



In strand (i) we developed numerical techniques for simulating fouling in refinery preheat train networks, incorporating real fouling behaviour, control actions, and different cost structures as part of a large optimisation problem. The capacity to determine optimal exchanger cleaning schedules was demonstrated with case studies drawn from industry. The simulation tools can also be used to asses and rank network retrofit and other exchanger revamping options.



A new method for modelling deposit ageing in crude oil fouling was also developed.



In strand (ii) we demonstrated that fluid dynamic gauging could be used, in principle, to study fouling layers at high temperature and pressure, over a wide range of flow rates. A device was designed to work on the crude oil fouling test rig being constructed at Imperial College. The capacity to make thickness measurements with an accuracy of 10 micron was demonstrated at lower pressures: the project finished before the device could be installed and tested on the Imperial rig. The technology has allowed other collaborators to use dynamic gauging in related applications.



Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the dynamic gauging were constructed and can be combined with the thickness measurements to determine the rheology of fouling layers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Both the exploitation routes above are directly relevant to industry, both for operating existing plant and designing new ones. Case studies have demonstrated the applicability of the scheduling software tool. The dynamic gauging devices can be used in industrial and commerical R&amp;amp;D on fouling and on cleaning, as well as a way of testing attachment of layers to surfaces and treated surfaces. The network simulation tool provides refinery operators with a tool to quantify the likely effect of fouling on their systems, and can be used by operators planning production as well as in design of more robust systems. This is being exploited in the development of the SmartPM software tool by IHS.

The fluid dynamic gauging devices allow fouling layers to be studied in new ways and this is being exploited by licensing or constructing devices for other users.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EC8C13F4-FAD6-4BF0-8B0B-2BCB2AC9C261</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3234498801.8595605774ea4e6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://opus.bath.ac.uk/22885/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Fluid dynamic gauging is a non-contact technique for measuring the thickness of soft solid layers on solid or membrane surfaces, immersed in liquids (which may be opaque, stagnant or flowing) in situ and in real time.
