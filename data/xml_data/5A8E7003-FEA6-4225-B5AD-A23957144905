This is due to the way in which the information is collected and recorded which, while suitable for some purposes, does not enable easy interrogation of the data to fully understand how their service is being delivered and where it could be improved. There is also scope to link the data held by charities to other national and international data sources to provide an opportunity for a much deeper analysis and understanding. This project will explore the feasibility of carrying out these linkages while protecting the confidentiality and rights of the victims themselves.

For this project a charity concerned with the rehabilitation of victims of torture, Freedom from Torture, has partnered with the University of Essex to explore how the data they collect and hold can be re-structured and cleaned to make it suitable for research and analysis. Freedom from Torture (FfT) is a national charity established in 1985 and has grown to have centres in London, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Newcastle and a service in Yorkshire and Humberside. They provide services to over 1,000 survivors of torture a year, who reside in the UK, most of whom are asylum seekers or have been granted some form of international protection. Their clients have experienced serious abuse and trauma and have complex needs and FfT prioritises helping those whose needs cannot be met by the National Health Service (NHS), social services or other voluntary sector organisations. FfT also provides other organisations that offer health and social care services with support for training, capacity building and promoting awareness of the unique needs of torture survivors. The work FfT carry out is informed by the experiences and voices of survivors of torture who access their services and FfT involve clients and former clients at every level through Service Users groups. FfT provides holistic care for each individual client and family following a comprehensive needs assessment. This approach embraces crisis intervention, long term rehabilitation, practical assistance, and / or the preparation of medico-legal reports which forensically document torture related injuries. 

Freedom from Torture's overall strategic aims are:(1) Rehabilitation: That survivors of torture in the UK realise their right to as full rehabilitation as possible; (2) Protection: Survivors of torture in the UK receive effective protection and are not returned to their countries of origin to face the risk of further torture; (3) Accountability: States responsible for torture are held to account publicly and the human rights of survivors are guaranteed nationally and internationally.

With these aims in mind this project will also explore how the Freedom from Torture information can be linked with other external data sources such as geograhical information or international information on human rights. We will explore what data can be made available in anonymised form to users in the third sector, academic and social policy researchers while protecting the identity and confidentiality of the victims themselves. A major aim of the project is to provide a data infrastructure that will support the development of best practice in the delivery of cost-effective and successful social support and therapeutic treatments for victims of torture. The project will therefore feed into many policy debates about how services are delivered and the best practice standards that should be applied. Being a victim of torture is a traumatic and scarring event in people's lives and supporting their recovery and rehabilitation in the best way possible underlies the core activities of this project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries of this project include a range of third sector organisations and individuals, operating at several levels both national and international. The direct impacts on beneficiaries could be rapid, not least victims of torture themselves who are supported by Freedom from Torture. Other campaigning organisations concerned with supporting victims of torture will have access to data that can help them adapt their strategies for providing support. Impact on policy debates on asylum and immigration could be rapid, as at present there is limited availability of data with which to understand the outcomes of victims of torture after arrival in the UK. 
Key beneficiaries are:
1) Third sector organisations and charities concerned with supporting victims of torture including The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, an organisation similar to Freedom from Torture with members all over the world: www.irct.org
2) Policy makers concerned with the allocation of resources e.g. through the NHS and social services to support victims of torture on arrival in the UK and through their rehabilitation.
3) Organisations litigating cases on behalf of torture survivors and dealing with asylum issues: REDRESS, AIRE Centre, OMCT, EHRAC and organisations working with victims of other types of violations such as trafficking in human beings
4) Organisations that carry out research on torture: APT, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, European Council on Refugees and Exiles 
3) Health professionals, practitioners and organisations responsible for supporting victims of torture and working on rehabilitation and access to social services including Helen Bamber Foundation, Refugee Council, Refugee Action (and related organisations), Red Cross, Children's Society, Barnardos. 
4) Academic and social policy researchers will benefit from having access to data not previously available to them in a standardised format suitable for analysis and with the potential to link to other external data sources. 
5) Freedom from Torture will benefit directly as an organisation through improvements in the quality of the data they collect and hold and the development of a data infratructure suitable for analysis and generating evidence-based policy and practice. The collaboration with academic researchers will build their capacity to utilise data in a novel way and extract new information to support their policy-making processes and service delivery. 
6) Local government, county, borough and unitary authorities in the UK who are responsible for providing services to support victims of torture on arival in the UK. The efficient use of data sources should have considerable impacts on practice in the provision of services within a mixed economy of provision. 
7) Government department researchers and policy makers. The likely impact is significant as new ways of utilising Big data in this area are developed. 
8) At the European level: the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Common European Asylum System
9) At international level: Various parts of the UN focusing on torture and refugee issues including the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Committee against Torture, High Commissioner for Refugees.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>211183</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Big Data in Social and Economic Research Workshop organised by the German Data Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C8BE996-5208-44FD-8642-DEB508B44ED9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Maria Fasli (Lead of the Methodological Research Stream), was invited to attend and present at the workshop &amp;quot;Big Data in Social and Economic Research&amp;quot; which was organised by the German Data Forum.
