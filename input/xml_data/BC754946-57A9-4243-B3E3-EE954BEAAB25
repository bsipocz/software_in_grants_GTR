(EST)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N007328/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Cities face a number of key transport challenges in the 21st Century. Congestion has a set of well-documented negative
consequences, including environmental pollution, poor economic competitiveness, low levels of public satisfaction with
public transport, negative impacts on personal health and wellbeing, and a broader reputational impact on urban centres that aspire to be retail and tourist destinations. Moreover, the UK's commitment to reduce carbon emissions necessitates a
broader long-term shift away from private motor transport towards low carbon and mass transit modes of transport. In this
way, tackling the specific issue of urban congestion relates to wider social and economic goals for cities to become better
places to live and easier places to navigate.
Specifically, Exeter has some of the worst air pollution and congestion statistics for a city of its size. Yet the city is also
witnessing unprecedented expansion of outlying suburbs, creating greater pressure on existing arterial and city centre
roads. Alongside these background factors, the city aspires to maintain its position as a key retail and tourist centre and
there are plans to redevelop several areas of the city centre for retail and leisure facilities in the coming years.
One of the ways in which social scientists have attempted to deal with this 'wicked' policy problem is to promote pre-formed
behavioural change through the provision of information and exhortations to individual travellers to change their behaviour.
However, decades of social research has illustrated that influencing behaviour is highly complex and requires a significant
investment in research intelligence about what influences travel behaviours. Although recent years have witnessed a
growth in social marketing approaches for influencing change, which adopt the methods of conventional marketing
approaches, a set of factors that have been largely omitted from such studies and interventions is the role of what can be
termed 'real time' factors in travel decision making, which are not pre-formed, but which influence practices in the moment.
Research intelligence from traffic management providers suggests that factors such as weather conditions, immediate
levels of traffic congestion and perceptions of the effectiveness of public transport are all important to consider when
understanding both decisions to travel and also the resultant behaviour of travellers on their journeys (either as drivers or
public transport users). Indeed, crucial to understand are the ways in which these conditions can be communicated to
promote different practices, either as decisions to travel using different modes or to drive in a different way, and the
potential for harnessing new technologies for managing travel behaviour through both the utilisation of sophisticated traffic
management systems.
This research therefore aims to understand and promote better 'real time' travel decision making through adopting a
personalised and tailored travel behaviour approach. This will be undertaken through a two stage methodology. In stage 1,
a large general survey of Exeter residents and those travelling into Exeter on a daily basis will be undertaken to explore key
travel behaviours, attitudes, participants' characteristics. Using an online survey approach, the questionnaire will enable
researchers to both identify key segment groups and their travel behaviours and, on the basis of these analyses, to make
high level statistical links between individual behaviours and external factors, including quantitative information from other
datasets. In stage 2, a panel of representative participants from the segments identified at stage 1 will be formed to explore
the key relationships between behaviours and specific interventions that will be captured through a series of experiments,
which will test interventions and their effectiveness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who are the potential beneficiaries, and how might they benefit?
The most immediate benefits will be felt by the Innovate UK project consortium partners, who will draw upon the research
undertaken by the University. The aim of this research is to understand, promote and influence better 'real time' travel
decision making by the general public. On the basis of this research there will be significant scope to harness new
technologies for managing travel behaviour, through both the utilisation of sophisticated traffic management systems and
individual smart technology. There is now a sizeable business opportunity for solutions that can reduce congestion in cities,
the Future Cities and Transport Systems Catapults have estimated that global integrated cities solutions market will be
worth &amp;pound;200 billion p.a. by 2030.
The potential benefits to each of the consortium partners is set out in turn below:
- NTT Data is the world's 6th largest IT systems integrator company, with an interest in big data analytics, sentiment
analysis, traffic management algorithms, warning delivery to sat nav and collaboration within smart transport systems
consortia. Through this project NTT is interested in developing products that can be applied to cities throughout the world.
They also anticipate the potential to bring significant new revenue streams to its UK business.
- Dynniq is a European technical solutions provider, in particular providing solutions for Intelligent Transport Systems and
specialised parts of the transport infrastructure market. Through this project Dynniq expect to increase market share in the
UK urban traffic management and control market, estimated at &amp;pound;150 million pa, from 25% to 27% within 3 years, resulting
in revenue of around &amp;pound;3m pa.
- Vaisala manufactures electronic measurement systems and equipment for meteorology and the environmental sciences,
traffic safety and industrial applications. Through this project Vaisala, with annual turnover of &amp;pound;8 million expectsincrease
of up to 50% in repeatable annual revenue from sensor sales after 5 years.
- Exeter City Council &amp;amp; Devon County Council, Exeter is a city undergoing unprecedented growth. This research will help to
address the well understood transport challenges experienced by the region regarding traffic congestion and associated
economic, health and environmental impacts. In particular for Exeter, congestion is considered a crucial issue that is creating major barrier to future economic growth.
Outside of the consortium we expect there to be social, well-being and economic benefits to the people of Exeter. For
example one of the most measurable benefits will be general journey time savings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>292229</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Exeter City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Engaged Smart Transport collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>42220462-C979-4C68-8756-4F5EE3B47D71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research is on-going and there are no consortium-wide outputs to report at present.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bf33c771bfa0.19837250-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners are providing a range of data and insights into the consortium that will develop a holistic congestion reduction framework for understanding how to promote sustainable mobility in urban areas.

Paper presented at the RGS-IBG Annual Conference, August 2016

The emergence of so-called big data and the personal adoption of mobile technologies have spurned considerable interest in the potential to deliver more efficient, 'smarter' and ultimately sustainable urban living. Such developments are often conceived at the macro scale, with the possibility of large-scale, inter-urban models of smart cities being deployed across a range of locations. It is highly likely that adoption of smart technologies and the use of integrated data could deliver more efficient traffic flows and ease some forms of congestion. Yet we propose that this view of the smart city is both unambitious and unsustainable. Rather, we argue in this paper for a place-centred, location-sensitive and engaged approach to developing visions of the city that are based on modal shift and low carbon mobility. In this way, we contend that both big data and mobile technologies do have a role to play, but that this role needs to be embedded within local contexts and created collaboratively with communities. In engaging people at the centre of the debate, we advocate a negotiated process for exploring how urban mobility can be transformed from carbon intensive modes to low carbon alternatives, whilst enabling wider conversations on city visions. Using insights gained from a current Innovate UK/NERC funded project on 'Engaged Smart Transport' in Exeter, UK, this paper explores some of the tensions surrounding the smart cities debate and the potential for using collaborative modes of working to engage citizens in co-creating place-centred and ambitious interventions for modal shift that blend technological innovation with insights from social marketing approaches.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a71a746488a0.69126122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sky TV business documentary featuring the EST project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ACF3EE88-E471-4C53-9F92-B1FE4561E8A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 minute Sky TV documentary on the innovative nature of the EST project, featuring an interview with Stewart Barr on the role of the University research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bf38eaa7cd81.54326214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.executivetv.org/en/media/engaged-smart-transport</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lead author: Sal Lampkin: presentation at the Exeter Initiative for Science and Technology event: Transport, at Sandy Park, Exeter, 28th APril 2016.

Title: Being smart or missing the point: The role of behavioural change in tackling high-carbon mobilities. Stewart Barr

Abstract
The notion of 'smarter cities' and the upholding to technologically-based 'solutions' to reduce carbon emissions in the urban environment is becoming rapidly adopted by corporations and local government as a way of tackling a range of carbon intensive practices: from private car use to domestic energy consumption. Such an approach is a logical extension of neo-liberal strategies to promote individual behavioural change as a way of tackling anthropogenic climate change and seems founded on the assumption that quicker, more personalised and accurate information will compel individuals to make different choices. In this panel session I argue that this neo-liberal 'vision' of the smart city is fundamentally narrow and unambitious because it fails to link the potential benefits of 'smart' technologies to the everyday lived experiences of the city that are framed by broader influences and which drive carbon-intensive social practices. Using empirical research from a series of projects on urban mobility practices, I argue that current 'smart' visions of the city are unlikely to result in significant reductions in carbon emissions because they often fail to engage with the infrastructures, residential environments and economic structures that frame and promote unsustainable mobility practices. Indeed, they can often act to perpetuate and reinforce 'visions' of the city that are carbon intensive, drawing on the language of efficiency whilst side-stepping the broader questions of envisioning and planning for cities that reduce the need for carbon intensive living and movement. Accordingly, I argue for the integration of new technologies into future city visions that can be used to support low carbon social practices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd312670af55.01355624</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article in Plymouth Herald</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61F60EF6-EA30-4E19-8BE3-0D379C236235</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article in Plymouth Herald outlining the EST project and to encourage people to participate in the online survey.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bf3bda3ac033.20572236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/search-smart-technology-solution-devon-congestion/story-29389075-detail/story.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lunchtime talk at Kaleider Studio about EST project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AE82605-5981-4229-AA13-338888D97EC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lunchtime talk by Dr Sal Lampkin on the EST project at Kaleider Studio in Exeter to an audience of creative practitioners.

Title: Being 'Smart': the role of behavioural change in tackling high-carbon mobilites, Stewart Barr, with Sal Lampkin, Laura Dawkins and Danny Williamson 

Abstract
The growth in emphasis on behavioural change as a way of tackling anthropogenic climate change and, by implication, the challenge of carbon-based mobilities has meant that the pathways for reducing carbon emissions have become largely defined as ones reliant on individual choice or, as the UK Government has often argued, 'Smarter' choices. Such choices may relate to behavioural decisions or the use and interaction with technologies that enable individuals and systems to maintain current levels of mobility and to do so more efficiently and with lower carbon emissions. Yet within geography there has been less discussion about we might reduce mobility through considering how such 'smart' technologies might connect with the role of urban infrastructure, services, land use planning and community-led initiatives to suppress the need for mobility. Drawing on current and previous research projects on mobility and low carbon transitions, this paper considers the ways in which we might re-configure a discussion on behavioural change through the lens of changes in social practices and their connection to infrastructures, technologies, and local economic systems, which could promote both changes in individual behaviours and re-invigorate urban spaces based on social interaction rather than motorised mobilities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd30cc8dc625.96285971</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lead author: Sal Lampkin: presentation at Transport Geography Research Group/DfT Knowledge Exchange workshop, DfT offices, London.

During the last 12 months, impact has been in the form of :

1. Presentations to a range of audiences, including professional practitioners, policy makers and academic audiences (see engagement activities). These presentations have highlighted the innovative approach of the project and the behavioural model developed. This has resulted in calls for further information and interest in the research results, when available. Indeed, engagement of practitioner audiences enabled high profile publicity for the Phase I survey, which reached 3,050 participants amongst the public. 

 2. The project is working directly with four commercial partners (NTT Data, Dynniq, Black Swan and Vaisala) alongside two local authorities (Exeter City Council and Devon County Council), Presentations of the Phase I results have been made to these partners and it is anticipated that the research will have an impact on the processes within the local authorities and will provide unique thematic and methodological insights and techniques for commercial companies developing congestion management systems in urban areas.

3. There has been considerable public engagement in the first and second phases of the research through both extensive publicity and engagement with the Phase I survey and Phase II workshops. These are detailed under 'engagement activities'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BD88C621-CDC6-45CA-AFAE-DD2B6429100D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb6f28c91439.69243948</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Phase 1 of the University's research on the EST project involved the design and roll-out of an online survey to commuters in Exeter. The survey was hosted online and was completed by 3,050 participants. Based on analysis of the survey results, the research team has created an innovative segmentation model for understanding the probability of commuters taking specific modes of transport to/from work, school university, based on travel mode identifiers and mode influencers. This has resulted in key insights into the types of variables that influence mode choice and has been used to convene a series of five workshops with commuters, to explore these influencers in greater detail and to explore opportunities for promoting change using an experimental intervention. The findings of these workshops will comprise the next submission to Research Fish in the 2017-18 submission. The findings of Phase I have been presented to the project partners and are being written up for publication in a number of outlets, focusing on both statistical methods and transportation research.
