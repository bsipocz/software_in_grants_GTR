Mutant mouse studies show that NRP1 is essential for neuronal and cardiovascular development, but recent findings indicate that NRP1 may have additional biological roles in other physiological and disease-related settings. However, despite the wealth of information regarding its probable biological role, many aspects of NRP1 regulation of cellular function remains uncertain, and little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms through which NRP1 mediates the functions of its various ligands in different cell types. Initial studies indicated that NRP1 functions primarily as a co-receptor without an independent signalling role, however emerging data from several groups now suggest that NRP1 supports functional cellular signalling through its intracellular C-terminal domain. In addition there are recent reports that suggest that NRP1 plays a major role in mediating cell signaling emanating from the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling pathways. Hence, understanding the signal transduction pathways mediated by NRP1 and identification of its downstream molecules is an important goal. We have recently shown that a mutant form of NRP1, which is unable to undergo post-translational Glyocosaminoglycan modification, when over-expressed in the human glioma cell line U87MG leads to an increased invasive phenotype mediated by the novel signalling adapter protein p130Cas. In addition, we have performed a novel yeast two hybrid screen using the NRP1 C-terminal domain as bait and identified several candidate interacting proteins. Importantly, we validated our screen by the identification of Synectin, a known NRP1 interacting protein. Experimental design of proposed investigation: The main focus of these studies will be on the role of NRP1 and its novel interacting proteins in mediating the functions of the major biologically important NRP1 mediated signaling pathways including; VEGF165, PDGF, and HGF. We will use tagged recombinant proteins for NRP1 and NRP1-associated proteins in functional biochemical assays to determine the nature of these interactions. In addition, using Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, and where applicable phospho-specific antibodies we will determine where and when in a variety of mammalian cell types, NRP1 interacts with NRP1 associated proteins, and how this interaction regulates their activation by extracellular stimuli. We will also investigate how mutations to NRP1, which result in deletion of the C-terminus, prevent VEGF165 binding, and post-translational GAG modification lead to changes in the affinity, localization and activity of NRP1 and its associated proteins. Furthermore, we will use specific small interfering (si)RNAs and mutant cDNA constructs for NRP1 and NRP1-associated proteins, delivered by adenoviral and retroviral infection, to investigate their role in cell motility using novel methods of 3 dimensional cell culture and automated multi-cell tracking of nuclear-GFP expressing cells in a variety of mammalian cell types. Finally, using a GFP zebrafish model we will assess the role of NRP1 signaling pathways by comparing the effect of morpholino knockdown of NRP1-associated proteins to the already establish NRP1 phenotype. We will focus on effects on embryonic development, developmental angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Importantly, we will determine if expression of morpholino resistant RNAs leads to rescue of the observed phenotype. Using this approach we have already found that one of the NRP1 interacting proteins pheno-copies the NRP1 morpholino effect.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G017921/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
