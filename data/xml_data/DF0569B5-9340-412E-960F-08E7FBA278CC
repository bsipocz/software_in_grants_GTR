in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L014904/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project seeks to exploit the potential of research-based theatre in order to address a specific non-academic cultural need - powerfully articulated in recent speeches by the Irish President, Dr Michael D. Higgins - which is to draw from our historical experience of migration an appropriately ethical response to the arrival of migrants in our own times. To achieve this, it is proposed to transform the research insights of the critically acclaimed book that was the key output of the original project into a more accessible format which goes beyond the forms of dissemination that traditionally serve academic communities. Drawing on his book's experientially rich testimonies, the PI will work collaboratively with non-academic partners, third sector organisations and charitable bodies to create and tour a bespoke play that will holistically engage and encourage new audiences to explore the diverse experiences and identities of the Irish in Britain since 1700. This specially commissioned play, written by renowned community-based playwright-director Martin Lynch, will be premised on the central arguments of the original project, which are that the testimonies of memoirists unsettle assumptions of Irish migrant homogeneity and contradict clich&amp;eacute;d views of emigration as a national tragedy. Consequently, the accent will be on the multiple ways of being Irish in Britain and on the extent to which migrant identities have been constituted in difference and division as much as in commonality and solidarity. By translating these personal narratives into an empathic drama, this innovative collaboration will provide an exciting opportunity to acquaint the wider British and Irish public with the central intellectual concerns of the original research, at a time when Ireland is once again shedding emigrants, many of whom are have begun to settle in Britain. As such, the play, which will tour community and cultural centres in Britain and Ireland over a three-week period, will offer n alternative performative way of accessing socially relevant knowledge, by eliciting responses that are experiential, embodied and affective, rather than simply cognitive. 

The project will feature an informative theatre programme, which will include an interview with the playwright-director, and post-performance panel discussions, which will allow audience members to ask questions and discuss the issues raised with the PI, playwright and cast. The project will also be accompanied by an innovative education and outreach programme, which will be modelled on previous successful programmes of this kind run by the participating not-for-profit theatre theatre company, Green Shoot Productions (GSP). This programme will take the form of six two-hour workshops delivered over six weeks in four selected venues: Belfast, Castlebar, Manchester and London. Each workshop will be co-ordinated by a local facilitator who will work with c.15 participants drawn from local communities in these places to enable them to shape and write down their memories and perceptions of emigration, a selection of which will be read at performances of the play and published in booklet form. Five of these workshops will precede the play's visit to these venues. The sixth will happen shortly afterwards, thereby providing a valuable additional means of capturing audience impact and feedback by working with an audience sample in a focused follow-up session. Although the reworking of personal narrative into performance has a long history, there has never been a staging of a project on Irish migration that purposefully dramatises research outcomes in this manner. The proposed project thus constitutes a novel way of making original research and its outcomes accessible to non-academic audiences in a dynamic, engaging and embodied way, thereby creating social and economic benefits through improvements in social and intellectual capital, social networking, community identity and quality of life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By enhancing popular understanding of cultural narratives of migration through research-based performance, this bespoke play will benefit the wider British and Irish public and older and newer generations of Irish people in Britain. It will also benefit members of communities affected by migration through its outreach programme, which is designed to give expression and dignity to the participants' stories. That two emigrant-focused charities - one London-based, the other Mayo-based - will benefit financially from the box office receipts further underlines the project's potential to have a positive societal impact. The play that will be the project's main output will be aimed at a non-specialist audience and will seek to exploit the capacity of personal accounts of physical journeys to initiate reflective inward journeys in those who view them. The play's episodic storytelling framework will engage viewers holistically, eliciting audience responses that are not merely cognitive but also affective and experiential. As such, the work will offer a powerful connective pathway to social understanding of cultural diversity, counter misleading myths and stereotypes and stimulate much-needed public debate on what an appropriately ethical response to the arrival of migrants in our own times should be.

Both the consultant playwright-director and the not-for-profit theatre company have been chosen for their excellent artistic fit for this project and also for their long-standing commitment to connecting with local communities and disadvantaged audiences outside academia. Steeped in the egalitarian values of community-based drama, Martin Lynch and GSP have been uniquely successful in reaching out to non-theatre-going audiences by taking plays to community-based venues in Ireland and Britain. At the core of Lynch's value system is a commitment to the highest aesthetic standards in the service of social, educational and even curative aims. Since the 1970s, he has been a powerful advocate of theatre as means to explore social and communal issues, to give public voice and visibility to hidden experience, to rehearse change and to envision new approaches to old problems. Working from these principles - which resonate strongly with those underpinning this proposal - Lynch produces plays that are socially relevant and culturally challenging, and which create opportunities for creative expression and cultural understanding. GSP regularly performs to audiences from the most disadvantaged communities and all its productions are accompanied by high-quality education and outreach programmes, which this project will replicate by running a six-week workshop event in four selected UK and Irish venues, the creative outputs of which (participants' stories and memoirs) will serve as a solid evidential base for impact claims. These, combined with the audience questionnaires distributed at all performances, will provide a valuable means of capturing the play's impact and assessing the extent of its personal resonance and emotional connection with audiences. 

Several durable social, cultural and economic benefits flow from this community-based tour, which this project aims to harness. The civic benefits to audiences will take the form of enhanced knowledge, strengthened community bonds and social networks, the public validation of overlooked histories and increased empathic understanding of the processes by which individuals are shaped by their ethnic origins and the multicultural cities in which they live. Foremost among the project's &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; impacts will be its contribution to strengthening partnerships between academic researchers, third sector organisations, charitable bodies and local communities; its economic contribution to regional areas through increased visitor numbers and public spending; and its potential to lead to the organisation of other cultural activities that could be initiated and managed by community groups themselves.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79067</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Even though we are at a very early point in the research lifecycle of my Follow-on Funding project, the project outputs have already been used to engage wider and more diverse audiences, specifically young people in the 15-25 age category. 

This came about thanks to an AHRC Connected Communities Festival 2015 award, which enable me to use the outputs of my Follow-on Funding award - specifically, the playscript of My English Tongue, My Irish Heart and the pieces of creative writing that were produced during the workshop series that accompanied the play's UK and Ireland tour - to engage young people from socially disadvantaged and ethnic minority backgrounds in inner-city Manchester in participatory activities based on cross-cultural experiences of immigration in the city. 

The Festival activities consisted of six two-hour interactive workshops and a final community event, which comprised a film screening and readings by young and adult creative writers. The workshops were led by Dr Andrew Hardman (researcher-filmmaker, Belle Vue Productions) and Dr Sheila McCormick (early career researcher, University of Salford), with additional input from myself as principal investigator and project co-ordinator. 

Four of the workshops took place in Z-arts in Hulme and attracted participants from a variety of ethnic minority backgrounds. The two other workshops were arranged following an expression of interest from the Transitions Outreach Worker at the Manchester centre of Rathbone England in Piccadilly Gardens. Rathbone England is a voluntary youth sector organisation that helps young people aged 14-24, many of whom are from BME, socially disadvantaged or unsettled backgrounds, to positively change their lives through learning. 

Each workshop used participatory drama, storytelling and film as vehicles for the exploration and sharing of migration narratives centred on Manchester. The central objective of the series was to develop the young participants' imaginative and empathetic understanding of how the lives of immigrants from Ireland and other countries might have corresponded to, or differed from, their own. To this end, we posed a series of questions, such as: What's your Manchester like?; What does it mean to be a Mancunian?; What might Manchester have meant to people who have chosen to settle here?; How can we develop characters for live and filmed performances?; What techniques can we use to tell life stories on camera or on the stage?

In the workshop themselves we made creative use of the archives of the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre and Education Trust in Manchester, whose mission is to educate people about Britain's ethnic minority communities. In particular, we drew on written and visual materials from the Trust's oral history projects to provide the workshop participants with snapshots from the life stories of immigrant people and communities in Manchester. Using these materials, the participants developed a character from whose perspective they wrote letters and postcards to friends and family 'back home.' This part of the process elicited some strikingly imaginative responses from the young participants, which were characterised by varying degrees of insight into and empathy with the experiences of newly arrived immigrants in Manchester at different historical moments. These letters were then read/performed by the participants and co-filmed by them, with the assistance of researcher-filmmakers from Belle Vue Productions. The resultant film was shown at the final community event at Z-arts on 11 July, alongside a screening of My English Tongue, My Irish Heart. The playwright Martin Lynch introduced the screening and took part in a lively audience discussion afterwards. 

In each of the six workshops the facilitators worked hard to engage the young participants intellectually and emotionally; to engender creative expression and cross-cultural understanding; to provide hands-on experience of film-making; and to develop their teamworking, performance and communication skills. The written and oral feedback from the workshop participants and community partners suggests that the Festival activities succeeded in offering ethnically diverse audiences from socially disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to explore Manchester's histories of migration in a transnational, cross-cultural context. Written feedback was collected using evaluation questionnaires circulated to the workshop participants. All of those who completed a questionnaire answered 'Yes' to the question 'Did you enjoy taking part in the workshops?' and 80% answered 'Yes' to the question 'Do you feel your learned anything from the workshops.' All rated the overall quality of the workshops to be 'Excellent' or 'Good.' 

Staff members at Rathbone, who sat in on the workshops, reported that they felt the project team did a very good job of engaging the young people and that the participatory activities were sufficiently well-designed to advance the participants' knowledge and understanding and develop their capacity for imaginative empathy with others. The Rathbone staff also said that the teamworking and one-to-one discussions that took place during the workshops complemented the formal training in employability and workplace skills that the young people are currently undertaking. 

From the project team's perspective, the co-design and co-delivery of the Festival activities brought multiple benefits, not least of which was the sharing of knowledge and expertise in a collaborative, interdisciplinary context that would otherwise not have happened.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>428ACAD3-8BF2-4337-8951-373771E42282</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55d85b17624200.83100159</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. This project's most significant achievement is its generation of significant new knowledge. In recent years, qualitative researchers in the fields of Health, Education and Social Science have endorsed the efficacy of using theatre-based methods of research inquiry and presentation. However, there are few examples of research-based projects that originate in literary or historical research, and fewer still that have resulted in full-scale theatrical productions. My project powerfully demonstrates how drama can be an effective medium for the dissemination of research findings in the Arts and Humanities to audiences beyond academia, including those individuals and communities with which the research is concerned. 

2. A second, closely related achievement is the project's contribution to community engagement, participation and learning. The play that was my project's chief output, My English Tongue, My Irish Heart, toured to nine venues across the UK and Ireland in May 2015. The play's sixteen performances attracted 2,073 attendees in total (ticketed, paid). Of these, 744 completed a detailed evaluation questionnaire (36% response rate), almost half of whom (44%) described themselves as first-time or infrequent theatre-goers. The data from these questionnaires provides strong evidence of the efficacy of research-based theatre in engaging non-academic audiences on a cognitive, emotional and embodied level. Audience members who completed a questionnaire rated the use of drama as a knowledge transfer tool very highly. Their written feedback reveals that the play managed to impart new knowledge to many viewers, consolidate the prior knowledge of others and challenge the prejudices and assumptions of others still. The overwhelming majority (94%) of respondents rated the overall quality of the production as 'excellent' or 'good.' 67% of attendees said they learned more than they already knew about Irish emigration and its effects, and 49% said that the play had in some way altered their views about migration at local and global level. 

3. The project also had a notable impact on the skill set of the forty-three people who took part in the series of six-week creative writing workshops which were organised as part of the project's educational outreach programme. Over 80% of the workshop participants rated the sessions as 'excellent' on the grounds that they enabled the participants to develop new skills and enhance their existing skills. 

4. A fourth significant achievement is the project's contribution local economies and to the social responsibility agenda. By attracting over 2,000 people to art centres and community centres in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and England, this project made a direct contribution to revenue generation and gross value added in performing arts and the wider supply-chain. In keeping with the project's commitment to social responsibility and community outreach, the proceeds from the play's month-long tour (&amp;pound;4,000) were donated to two emigrant welfare charities, namely, the Aisling Return to Ireland Project in London and the Safe Home Programme in County Mayo in Ireland, both of which provide support and advice to vulnerable and isolated migrants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings of my project might potentially be of interest to those in the Education, Culture and Heritage sectors. One obvious way in which my findings might be put to use is by other researchers in the Arts and Humanities who wish to explore the use of research-based theatre as an alternative mode of research representation and audience engagement. For such individuals, my project provides a useful, practical exemplum, insofar as it demonstrates how research-based theatre performances can (a) act as an effective means of Arts and Humanities research dissemination beyond the academy and (b) act as an effective pedagogical tool for engaging audiences, expanding understandings and provoking new learning experiences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DB902A3-C097-4E41-BCCB-7CD89EF15B3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55d8540c7112d4.54307137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.mycountryajourney.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>490BFF64-1862-45C3-9975-4AD54D5354EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Something About Home: New Writing on Migration and Belonging</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1f04b2b760c62b8fd92d2aa2fe3dc085"><gtr:id>1f04b2b760c62b8fd92d2aa2fe3dc085</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harte Liam</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780906602843</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7812a75144f7.37651813</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B16B733A-4DEE-49AE-AC6A-325308534913</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conversations on a collaboration: an interview with Martin Lynch</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Irish Studies Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/131a8cb072b25316cadfe6f04521bbb0"><gtr:id>131a8cb072b25316cadfe6f04521bbb0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harte L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a65ae1b470f66.98442460</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CB169BF7-E76D-46ED-A920-B29A92C3EF71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transforming research into art: the making and staging of
