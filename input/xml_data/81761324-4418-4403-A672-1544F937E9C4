The use of post-genomic technologies and cutting edge systems biology approaches in the project aims to enhance the output of specific target molecules, aiming at production levels sufficient for industrial purposes. The overall focus of SmartCell is on monoindole alkaloids (MIAs) produced by Madagascan periwinkle. The JIC part of this project will involve the identification and validation of genes required for synthesis of terpenes in plants with specific emphasis on identification of genes and enzymes for MIA modification, using a combination of a candidate gene approach, heterologous expression (using a plant virus-based expression system), and a resource of plant mutants.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229371</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The major scientific and technological impacts of this project have been to identify key steps in terpene biosynthesis including those for production of medicinal compounds through the deep sequencing and systematic screening of gene libraries to identify sequences corresponding to specific enzyme activities, and to introduce these steps into heterologous plants. The methods developed within this project can be used to streamline other metabolic engineering strategies required for the introduction of complex pathways into heterologous plants.

In addition to these direct impacts it is important to recognize the potential wider impact of the project on industry, health and the environment. The project focused on the transfer of
metabolic capabilities to highly scalable platforms such as our Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression platform and yeast platform, advances that have opened up opportunities for subsequent work with industry, for example through the IB Catalyst programme. By extending this process to other terpenoids, and indeed to other metabolic pathways, it will be possible to produce such compounds in large amounts
at minimal cost once a productive expression platform has been developed. In turn this will reduce the use of environmentally-harmful processes such as total chemical synthesis or extraction from rare and endangered plant species. This project has therefore created a defined
path for the conversion of basic scientific information (the components of metabolic pathways) into applications of real value to industry, medicine and agriculture, thus
validating the concepts, tools, tangible materials, resources, intellectual property and regulatory/biosafety aspects that influence the commercial manufacture of value-added
products from plants.

During this project a series of three Science, Art and Writing projects (www.sawtrust.org) were carried out by JIC on the theme of plant natural products. 1st at Lionwood Infant school in Norwich, UK, 9.7.2009, 2nd at Morley primary school in Norfolk 6.11.2009, 3rd at Notre Dame High School in Norwich 5.5.2010. Lesson plans developed during these projects have been made available through the SmartCell website for use by others, so contributing resources for science education on the theme of high value chemicals from plants in schools.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C9E6C35B-05A8-426D-BD5E-D78DD423D197</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cb4f4838429.63045376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The major scientific and technological impacts of this project have been to identify key steps in terpene biosynthesis including those for production of terpenes of agricultural, medicinal and industrial biotechnology importance. The methods developed within this project, including those for genome mining for new metabolic pathways in plants, can now be used to streamline pathway discovery and metabolic engineering of plant natural product pathways into heterologous species, including rapid plant-based expression platforms and microbes (Baker's yeast).

We have also trained early career researchers within the consortium in the design and delivery of Science, Art and Writing (SAW) projects in schools (see www.sawtrust.org for further information) and have developed resources for science education in schools using the theme of SmartCell as subject material.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work has opened up new opportunities for genome mining based on our discovery that the genes for the synthesis of plant natural products are in some cases organised in clusters in plant genomes. Numerous such clusters have now been discovered by other labs, inspired by our findings. It has also enabled us to start to build a toolkit of genes and enzymes for terpene biosynthesis for synthetic biology approaches. This toolkit is now being developed in subsequent projects and will be opened up to the community via the OpenPlant Synthetic Biology Research Centre (of which Professor Anne Osbourn is a co-Director), which is currently putting in place a plant syntax, registry and repository to support plant synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>883EC8DA-B7EF-41F9-8FEB-38A85779D11D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb7f0712f69.56035449</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Creative Economy,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.smart-cell.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D707A467-3F04-447F-BCAF-33C1267EA5B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Triterpene biosynthesis in plants.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annual review of plant biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d6c7d89a1bc2c5e40f41d21d33aeb265"><gtr:id>d6c7d89a1bc2c5e40f41d21d33aeb265</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thimmappa R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1543-5008</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5460e5567791f6.84584086</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA372</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
