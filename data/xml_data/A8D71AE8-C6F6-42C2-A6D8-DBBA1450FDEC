Individuals are faced with a wider range of options (from social and traditional media), new patterns of exposure (socially mediated and selective), and alternate modes of content production (e.g. user-generated content). In order to understand change (and stability) in opinions and behaviour, it is necessary to measure to what information a person has been exposed. The measures social scientists have traditionally used to capture information exposure usually rely on self-reports of newspaper reading and television news broadcast viewing. These measures do not take into account that individuals browse and share diverse information from social and traditional media on a wide range of platforms. According to the OECD's Global Science Forum 2013 report, social scientists' inability to anticipate the Arab Spring was partly due to a failure to understand 'the new ways in which humans communicate' via social media and the ways they are exposed to information. And social media's mixed record for predicting the results of recent UK elections suggests better tools and a unified methodology are needed to analyze and extract political meaning from this new type of data.

We argue that a new set of tools, which models exposure as a network and incorporates both social and traditional media sources, is needed in the social sciences to understand media exposure and its effects in the age of digital information. Whether one is consuming the news online or producing/consuming information on social media, the fundamental dynamic of consuming public affairs news involves formation of ties between users and media content by a variety of means (e.g. browsing, social sharing, search). Online media exposure is then a process of network formation that links sources and consumers of content via their interactions, requiring a network perspective for its proper understanding. We propose a set of scalable network-oriented tools to 1) extract, analyse, and measure media content in the age of &amp;quot;big media data&amp;quot;, 2) model the linkages between consumers and producers of media content in complex information networks, and 3) understand co-development of network structures with consumer attitudes/behaviours.

In order to develop and validate these tools, we bring together an interdisciplinary and international team of researchers at the interface of social science and computer science. Expertise in network analysis, text mining, statistical methods and media analysis will be combined to test innovative methodologies in three case studies including information dynamics in the 2015 British election and opinion formation on climate change. Developing a set of sophisticated network and text analysis tools is not enough, however. We also seek to build national capacity in computational methods for the analysis of online 'big' data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The tools developed as part of will contribute to better understand the dynamic interplay in informational flows between users, traditional news outlets and new social media and to examine the relationship between information exposure and public opinion/behaviour. The implications of this research can also inform debates about the effectiveness of media policy and regulation in influencing citizens' political beliefs and engagement as well as their environmental attitudes and behaviour. In this direction, the outcomes of ExpoNet will allow us to address key ESRC strategic priorities such as influencing behaviour and informing interventions. 

Potential Policy and Societal Impact:
The outcomes of this project will benefit a large and diverse user community outside academia. Potential beneficiaries include government agencies, third sector organisations, industry organisation and practitioners interested in understanding the central characteristics of the complex information environment prevalent in modern societies and in assessing how it affects mass attitudes and behaviours. One segment of this extra-academic user group comprises policy-makers involved in the design of media policy as well as public institutions interested its societal consequences, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for Education, and the Electoral Commission. A different group consists of non-governmental organisations interested in the impact of media messages on political participation, and such as International IDEA, the Institute for Government, the Electoral Society and Demos. Another user group consists of media organisations and journalists who provide audiences - the mass audience as well as more specialised and targeted audiences - with (political) information. Finally, the outputs of this project will also benefit key industry user-groups, including social research and market firms and marketing agencies.

Non-academic users and potential beneficiaries will be invited to participate in our stakeholder and dissemination workshop, where the web application developed by SeeDATA and research outputs of ExpoNet will be presented and their implications for media policy and regulation will be discussed. We will actively seek to recruit participants taking advantage of existing partnerships with organizations like Kieskompas, OfCom, and public broadcasters stemming from research networks the research team members are currently involved in. The members of the project team have worked and engaged in consulting with non-governmental and governmental organizations, and thus have experience in communicating research findings to wider audiences. We will also rely on the ESRC Communications Toolkit to reach wider non-academic communities.

Research Area Impact:
Another benefit of the research is to the UK Research Area: the visibility of the UK as a venue for research on computational social science and big data analysis. The innovative set of methodological tools and associated user-friendly software/source code developed during the life of the project to conduct and integrate statistical network and text analysis will have applicability to a rich set of questions in the social sciences in general, and will contribute to place the UK at the forefront of this growing research area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>486296</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ICM Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Clicking on Brexit</gtr:description><gtr:id>18711CD0-C8B6-4BDB-9792-B8FFA5ECD604</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data collected was briefly reported in this publication:

We developed a series of protocols and code that implement different methods relevant to project goals. Several of these methods are currently being developed into a series of short help sheets with attendant short (90 second) technical videos. These will deposited on NCRM page, on an EXPONet github account https://github.com/EXPONetProject, and on a research cluster webpage https://mediaeffectsresearch.wordpress.com/exponet/intro-to-jupyter-notebook/).

Code developed so far includes methods for:
? Harvesting data from traditional news (online editions), news broadcasts (transcripts), and social media (Twitter and public Facebook pages). Methods include techniques for use of cloud computing (Amazon AWS) to parallelise data collection, enabling rapid collection of large historical social media datasets.
? Automated coding of web content (e.g. HTML pages, URLs). Substantial progress has been on code pipelines for separating the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; content of a webpage from unwanted content such as embedded adverts. Further work has developed scripts for determining whether a given URL points to a user-facing webpage or to unwanted supporting web sources (such as hidden domains used to direct embedded advertising).
? Extracting social networks from large volumes of Twitter data. Techniques include standard methods such as retweet/mention interactions, alongside novel methods such as using the &amp;quot;one hop&amp;quot; neighbourhood of adjacent nodes to give greater density and infer community structure in sparse networks.
? Extracting shared links from Twitter content and constructing &amp;quot;shared audience&amp;quot; networks of web domains linked by individual users who shared content from both. These networks allow similar exposure patterns to be identified in the user population, and clusters of web domains to be identified based on the overlap in the user groups who access their content.
? Temporal clustering of networks based on similar community structure. This can be used as a dimension reduction technique for complex media exposure networks that evolve over time.
? Tracking cascading &amp;quot;reply&amp;quot; activity in Twitter, enabling tracking of conversations started around a single post or event.
? Tools for linking web activity of users (taken from comprehensive activity logs provided by volunteers from the ICM panel, see below) to longitudinal survey responses.
? We wrote an R/C++ implementation for a number of supervised, generative text classification models shown to perform well for solving large, multi-label classification problems. We are in the process of finalizing an R package (superlda) that will be made available to researchers on CRAN and GitHub. 
? We developed a custom web-scraping and crawling framework built on top of the open-source Python library scrapy (https://scrapy.org).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Currently, we envision that the academic community will make use of the tolls available through EXPONet through their own research.
