Family'</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M006018/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Although there is a long history of social work and other practitioners involving wider family in trying to resolve difficulties faced by particular family members, the evidence base to support this activity has been relatively weak. Since the early 1990s, a number of developments in law, policy and performance management have had the perhaps unintended consequence of directing agencies and practitioners to focus on specific needs and risks relating to particular individuals, rather than seeing the 'bigger picture' of how family networks actually operate and what might be their potential to provide more effective support or resolve issues for those experiencing difficulties. 

In more recent years, there has been increasing recognition at government level that this tendency has been counter-productive in terms of delivering services that actually enable people to resolve or manage their difficulties - and has instead resulted in responses that are both costly and can hook people into an unnecessary longer term dependence on a range of public services. However, there has been much less clarity as how best to turn around approaches to service delivery and what might be the best models for delivering services that engage the potential of families and their social networks. 

Policy initiatives such as 'Think Family' and 'Troubled Families' have fostered the development of new models and ways of working at a local level and in a variety of organisational contexts. From recent research studies and evaluations, we now have some emerging evidence as to 'what works' within specific service contexts - and also what may be barriers to implementing such approaches within existing organisational structures and processes. However, our understanding is far from complete - and what we currently know has not yet been pulled together across different service contexts in a systematic way that can be shared more widely with policy and practice organisations. 
 
It is the purpose of this proposal to bring together academic and practice communities to facilitate an interchange of knowledge, ideas and evidence that can be used to drive forward effective and innovatory practice - with different service sectors learning from one another. Maximum impact would be achieved by three linked areas of work:
A. Building links within and between organisations to enable a two-way flow that brings in new knowledge and understanding from outside and, in return, gives space for reflection and evaluation of how service innovations are actually working (or not working) as they are applied on the ground.
B. A programme of knowledge exchange seminars and more informal workshops that bring together service managers and practitioners from across health, social care and the voluntary sector, with a particular emphasis on building bridges between services in different sectors.
C. Development of a protected 'partners' website for informal exchange of information and discussion of ideas in development. This would provide a platform for developing research summaries, descriptions of effective service models, discussion papers and training resources. Once developed, these would then be made publically accessible via the Family Potential Research Centre website for practitioners and managers. 

Taken together, these three strands of knowledge exchange activity will achieve direct impact on policies and models of service delivery within around thirty participating organisations during the lifetime of the project. Beyond this, it will have wider cross-sector impact through making available the resources that have been developed, so that they can be utilised by other organisations who are facing similar challenges of how to to introduce ways of working that see beyond the individual, and mobilise the potential of wider family relationships in improving and sustaining positive outcomes for family members.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is recognised from the outset that there can be little space within many health and social care agencies for practitioners and mangers to learn from (and contribute to) relevant research. Nevertheless, we already have interest from a cross-section of organisations across England towards developing more family inclusive policies and modes of practice, as this is starting to be seen as essential if services are to meet the challenges that they are now facing. 

This proposal builds on an emerging network of committed organisations that spans statutory and voluntary sector provision and offers an infrastructure whereby the space within organisations for learning, evaluating and training could be opened up to, and shared with, a wider supported community of practice. This would be facilitated by the lead Universities and the Family Potential Research Centre. By this approach, key staff in participating organisations can, in a real sense, feel ownership of driving forward and evaluating the implementation of new models of practice - thereby maximising the potential impact of research in this field.

In turn, this translation of ideas and evidence into practice, and the resultant exchange of knowledge between academia and the field, will be captured in the form of Papers and accessible learning resources that can be made available nationally via the development of the outward facing Family Potential website.

Who will benefit?
The intended beneficiaries of the knowledge exchange will be health, social care and voluntary sector service organisations and, more importantly, the families and family members who are seeking help from them. Around thirty participating organisations, and those who use their services, may be expected to receive the most immediate benefit. In the longer term, with the knowledge and learning resources that are generated through the project being made generally available via the Family Potential website, it is anticipated that there will be potential benefit across the sector nationally.

How will they benefit?
Service organisations will benefit through using research evidence and knowledge from the field to embed ways of working that are more effective in mobilising family resources. Such a shift would reduce the likelihood of re-referral or ongoing dependence on services - thereby both improving outcomes and cutting costs so as to achieve a more efficient use of limited human and financial resources.
Families will benefit from services that include and take seriously the concerns and aspirations of all family members - and which help them to build on their collective resources, strengths and capabilities, rather than focusing just on what they cannot do or have not been able to do well. In turn, this should lead to their having more control and greater confidence in their ability to resolve their own difficulties and improve their lives - resulting in enhanced wellbeing and greater opportunity for family members to participate in the social and economic life of their communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During the course of the ESRC Knowledge Exchange seminar series, recordings of the speakers and subsequent debates were made.

Taking stock of developments in policy and practice: This was the first in a series of Knowledge Exchange seminars. The seminar looked at what had happened to the 'Think Family' policy agenda, and focused on sharing experience from practice. The seminar asked what we can learn from this practice with families, and what may be interesting areas for further research and development. Contributions were made by: Professor Kate Morris (University of Nottingham), Dr Jerry Tew (University of Birmingham), Professor Andrew Pithouse (Cardiff University), Rachael Wardell (Berkshire County Council), Stephen Goodman (Morning Lane Associates), Deirdre Lewis (BIG Manchester/Improving Futures) and from young carers' initiatives.

The seminar was hosted by the Open University in London and had 35 delegates drawn from private, public and third sector organisations involved in delivering direct front-line services to families. The seminar drew delegates from across health and social care sectors, and was attended by the Chief Social Worker for Adults. The event inspired one of the speakers to write a blog post, and inspired twitter conversation about some of the themes being pulled out from the day.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b89592e58f64.93015376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.familypotential.org/?page_id=29</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>05/05/2015 - Parental mental health and child welfare: 'Think Family' review meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B27737E4-BEF0-4541-AAED-C552BB963B4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Parental mental health and child welfare - 'Think Family' review meeting: A meeting took place of 15 professionals drawn from across England and one participant from Northern Ireland. The meeting took place at the University of Birmingham with the aim of discussing the shape and scope for the upcoming ESRC seminar series in order to ensure that it spoke to as broad a range of relevant audience members as possible. Discussion took place in order to glean a more textured understanding of what would be most useful and relevant for practitioners from a range of organisations across the public and third sectors. The meeting drew some participants from an existing parental mental health and child welfare network, in order to inform the understanding of the particular issues in families where there was parental mental illness. The outcome of the meeting was informative suggestions for the upcoming program of seminars including the individuals nominating organisations (both present and not present) to be approached to participate in Knowledge Exchange activities, and to potentially speak at the seminars. This early meeting facilitated drawing together several existing but dormant networks to reinvigorate them and to look at whole-family approaches across health and social care. The meeting also helped to identify organisations and individuals who had case study material that might be usefully shared on the Family Potential website, or those who might wish to contribute articles to the Pavilion annual publication: Parental mental health and child welfare work: volume 1.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b894c59c1733.34402085</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>12/11/2015 - Presentation at Family Group Conferencing Practice Network meeting.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CB5158B-9D28-4AF5-AAC0-F9E9A563190E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Tew gave a presentation on Family minded practice and family group conferencing in adult services and mental health and discussion at Family Group Conferencing Practice Network meeting.

It aimed to: Share ideas from research and practice on how we can work together to support services and practices that are experienced as humane by all involved; Learn from successful examples of system reform such as that undertaken in New York, where parent advocacy became a recognised and valued aspect of provision; Hear from families with histories of hurt and trauma about how services can make a difference.

This seminar focused on exploring approaches that are genuinely democratic in terms of sharing power with (and within) family and social networks. This can involve both a relentless search for the potentials and capabilities within relational networks, and also a recognition that these may also be the site of past (or current) trauma or abuse, or failure to recognize, protect or support individuals within them. The Seminar offered a mix of theoretical and practice focused discussions and featured current developments including: Family Group Conferencing and its application in children's and adults' settings; Open Dialogue - a radical relationally focused approach in mental health; Community and asset-based approaches to enabling families in adversity.

The seminar was held at the University of Birmingham and drew participants from across health and social care, but particularly those with an interest in family group conferencing and Open Dialogue methods. There was a lively debate about the synergies, differences, and parallels between the approaches presented, and discussion about what the approaches were trying to achieve within a whole-family paradigm. The day was facilitated and co-chaired by a service user and family member, and had a particularly moving presentation from the family member of a young man whom had been in mental health services prior to his suicide. The day was a fantastic synergy between lived experience, policy, practice and academic research. Drawing these strands together was reported by those attending the event as inspiring and gave people lots of material to discuss when they returned to their practice settings. There were several requests for the presentations to be made available on the website, which has been done, so that these could be shared with colleagues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b89c6a742f99.75600895</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.familypotential.org/?page_id=29</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Practice Network for Family Group Conferencing with Adults</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>885D81E2-F4C9-498A-A8A6-321103067DC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An event for FGC practitioners from across the UK with input and discussion around the themes of:

There were three identified workstreams:
Workstream A - Developing research and innovation infrastructure within and between partner organisations
Workstream B - Knowledge Exchange seminars 
Workstream C - Web-based Knowledge Exchange.

Delivering the Knowledge Exchange across the three workstreams has been achieved through hosting four 'headline' seminar events; the development of resources which are made available to the wider policy and practice community though the website; reviewing the literature around whole-family approaches; and establishing, managing and maintaining a growing network of academics, practitioners, managers and policy makers. 

Workstream A - the Knowledge Exchange has engaged with a network of around 25 partner organisations, including a range of Local Authorities, NHS and voluntary sector organisations, together with the Department of Health. These included both organisations that had offered contributions as part of the original bid and other organisations that subsequently joined the programme of activity. The Knowledge Exchange has also linked in to and contributed to the development of existing or emerging policy and practice networks, such as those around parental mental health and child welfare, and the development of Family Group Conferencing across children's and adult services. Through development work with these partner organisations, practitioners and managers have been enabled to evaluate and learn in relation to their specific areas of experience; to (co)present at events both linked specifically to the Knowledge Exchange and at conferences and meetings linked to these other networks; and to publish alongside academic contributors in a format suitable for a wider practitioner audience. We worked closely with the editor of the Pavilion Annual on Parental Mental Health and Child Welfare Work, and the 2015/16 edition included 6 Papers that arose directly from the Knowledge Exchange.

Alongside this, the academic leads of the Knowledge Exchange have provided masterclasses and other such inputs for local and regional practitioner networks. An indication of the 'reach' of the Knowledge Exchange has been that over 170 individuals from outside the academic sector have so far signed up to the mailing list - the majority from Local Authorities, but with substantial representation from the voluntary sector, NHS organisations and central government.

Workstream B - Across the four Knowledge Exchange Seminars that have taken place so far, a total of 178 individuals have participated - attracting both an academic audience (approximately 25% of attendees were academics from a range of universities) and a wider audience from policy and practice roles, including Chief Social Workers from England and New Zealand. The format of each seminar has included a balance of short presentations from academic researchers and from practitioners, trainers, service directors and family members with a view to stimulating round-table or workshop discussion between participants that capitalised on their varied experience and backgrounds. The final event in April 2016 was oversubscribed - and over one half of the participants were newly joining the Knowledge Exchange process. By holding seminars in different locations (London, Sheffield, Birmingham and Huddersfield) we have been able to draw in participants from across England, including Cornwall, Kent, Merseyside and Northumberland (see map www.familypotential.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESRCKE-FPRCmap2016.pdf).

In addition to the seminars, specialist groups have been brought together to look at issues of mutual interest and to share practice learning and experience (for example parental mental health and child welfare; development of Family Group Conferencing in adult services). 

Workstream C: The ESRC Knowledge Exchange was nested deliberately within a virtual environment - the website of the Family Potential Research Centre www.familypotential.org, which was launched to coincide with the Knowledge Exchange programme. This has been particularly important when building a brand identity around this area of work for practitioner audiences. In nesting the networks and relationships developed through the ESRC Knowledge Exchange process in this way, it has allowed for the conversation to continue and for collaborations and partnerships to continue to occur once the grant-funded work was completed at the end of April 2016. A broader community of interest in the policy and practice communities has been engaged through twitter, e-mail correspondence, and through interest generated by the website. During the course of the Knowledge Exchange, the website generated over 4300 page views.

On the website, the presentations and discussions from the Knowledge Exchange seminars have been made accessible to the wider policy and practitioner community via downloadable audio podcasts as well as written notes of presentations and summaries of discussions. Presenters and attendees have posted blogs as a way of promoting debate and knowledge exchange beyond the specific events - and twitter has provided an effective means of alerting the wider policy and practice community about new ideas, evidence and dialogues. In addition, the website hosts and provides an opportunity for disseminating information about projects and services adopting innovative approaches for engaging with whole families - together with digests of and links to relevant research reports and publications. At a more practical level, it also provides a noticeboard for upcoming conferences and training events of interest to the practitioner community. 

The most tangible impact on policy is to be found in the joint Care Act implementation guidance on The Care Act and Whole-Family Approaches which has been published in draft form by the Department of Health, the Association of Directors of Adult Services, the Local Government Association, the Children's Society and the Carers' Trust http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/5756320/The+Care+Act+and+whole+family+approaches/080c323f-e653-4cea-832a-90947c9dc00c. This guidance marks a major step-change in government policy, with 'Think Family' principles being applied in a comprehensive way for the first time in an adult services context. Theoretically, it also marks a shift from the implicit prioritisation of the individual in the earlier 'Think Child, Think Parent, Think Family' pilots that had sought to bring together children's and mental health services. Within this guidance, Step One is defined as 'Think Family'. 

While the preparation of this document predated the formal start of the Knowledge Exchange Programme, it draws explicitly on the idea of 'Think Family' and two of the key bodies involved in its preparation were also involved from the outset in the Knowledge Exchange - the Department of Health (represented by the Chief Social Worker for Adults) and the Carers' Trust. The Seminars and networking activity provided an opportunity to share and embed the ideas put forward in the guidance with a wider community of local authority and voluntary sector organisations. 

There is a growing interest among local authorities in implementing genuine 'whole family' approach in local policies and protocols - for example in rolling out a Family Group conferencing approach in adult social care, as evidenced by the attendance of over 30 at a recent UK networking event for local authorities hosted by the London Borough of Camden in May 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>133F97BD-CD34-43B8-93CD-EC96DA6F8E5D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0346dbf0055.80661795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key Findings

The Knowledge Exchange has achieved the mobilisation of a broad community of interest around the development and understanding of family-inclusive ways of working - with a focus on models and approaches that are genuinely innovative, and the theories, policies and practices that underpin these. A key finding has been that, despite changes in government and a shifting policy agenda, there has been a continuous and ongoing process of development and innovation, across a range of organisations and sectors, since the unveiling of the Cabinet Office 'Think Family' policy initiative in 2007 - which was based on a commissioned literature review that was led by members of the research team (Morris et al, 2008). 

At a policy level, a comprehensive literature review of developments since the inception of the 'Think Family' stream of policy and practice has been augmented by current knowledge from the field. The latter has identified particular sites of development (Local Authority and wider) and also systemic factors that may be inhibiting the development of such approaches. This has been summarised for a policy and practitioner audience in Tew et al (2016). This chapter, together with more specific information about promising initiatives, has been made available via the Family Potential Research Centre website www.familypotential.org.

At a theoretical level, the Knowledge Exchange has been helpful in teasing out a more sophisticated understanding of the levels of 'family mindedness' first identified in the 2007 'Think Family' literature review - and, in particular, identifying practice and policy models that start with a relational conception of family processes and practices, rather than those which start with a focus just on an individual's needs or on a binary (or 'axial') relationships in which one family member is just defined as a 'carer' or 'parent'. It has also provided a forum for developing thinking around more specific ideas such as researching and theorising the impact of trauma at a system level - the subject of a Journal article in preparation. 

The Knowledge Exchange has provided a forum for exploring research evidence in relation not just to 'what works' but also 'how it works'. This has included presenting research on established and innovative approaches in mental health and how approaches such as Family Group Conferencing or young carers' initiatives can be transformative in relation, not just to outcomes for particular families, but also in bringing about wider system change. Associated with this, a Paper entitled 'Family-inclusive approaches to reablement in mental health: models, mechanisms and outcomes' has been accepted for publication by the British Journal of Social Work. Perhaps the most productive aspect of the Knowledge Exchange has been learning across sectors - for example, with links (and challenges) being made between relationally oriented approaches rooted in ideas of restorative practice (e.g. in youth justice) and those rooted in ideas of recovery (primarily in mental health and in family support projects).

The most immediate impact will be on agencies that were already actively moving in this direction. 

A number of public and voluntary sector services are considering the reconfiguration of their services so that they more family inclusive. Some such developments are taking place within a specific sector - e.g. child protection services in Leeds and the piloting of Open Dialogue mental health services in NHS Trusts in London, Kent, Somerset and Nottinghamshire. Some Local Authorities are now embarking on a more holistic transformation that brings together the work of the Authority across children's and adults' social care, 'troubled families', public health and education (e.g. West Berkshire and, to a significant extent, Birmingham). Some initiatives cross agency boundaries with the lead coming from voluntary sector organisations who are working with both Local Authorities and NHS Trusts (e.g. Liverpool, Manchester, Gloucestershire).

Through the seminars and the materials available via the web, a second tranche of agencies are showing interest - and academic co-applicants of the Knowledge Exchange have been invited to provide consultancy, evaluation and 'masterclasses' for practitioners and managers. Dr Jerry Tew and Prof Brid Featherstone have each been invited to contribute webinars on the Children's Social Work Matters portal in the Yorkshire and Humber region which give a reach to over 1,600 Children's Social Work professionals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>26F7FE56-7EB9-4D26-A62C-6A1BADBC009B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e021858be9b8.56482953</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.familypotential.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Draft Guidance on The Care Act and Whole-Family Approaches - Department of Health, ADASS, LGA, Children's Society and Carers' Trust</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CAB2096-D7F6-41FA-BB78-626125EC7C86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e04de180eb55.58843833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.local.gov.uk/documents/10180/5756320/The+Care+Act+and+whole+family+approaches/080c323f-e653-4cea-832a-90947c9dc00c.</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>In order to communicate with a diverse range of stakeholders effectively; to ensure communication about events (both internal and external) in a timely manner; as well as individual e-mails and maintaining a database of key contacts, a website was developed as part of the Knowledge Exchange activities.

The website also serves as a dissemination platform for any academic grants being facilitated by or affiliated with the Family Potential research centre.

The website is also linked to a twitter account created for the Knowledge Exchange, that was used to communicate with network members about events that were upcoming or had recently taken place.
