In particular I focused on the pathway which needs to be followed in order to obtain regulatory approval to commence a phase I/II clinical trial for retinal disease. The seminar was well-attended (over 50 students and academic staff) and I continued an open discussion with a group of students for another hour after the seminar. During this post-seminar session, I posed them questions relating to my TSB funded work with ReNeuron and they discussed these points in groups and then responded to me, posing their own questions in return.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56daa50b5f5595.15357738</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ucl.ac.uk/brain-sciences/student-news/ophthalmology-seminar-series</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The medical product is a human retinal progenitor cell line generated by the company ReNeuron which is in an active stage of pre-clinical development.
