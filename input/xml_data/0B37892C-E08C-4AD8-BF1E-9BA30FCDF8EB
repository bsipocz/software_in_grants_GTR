The communities share similar values of mutuality and collectivism and have a keen awareness of their historical identities. However their approaches vary markedly: one is a public-facing heritage site, while the other is a much more obviously politicised activist community.

According to the sociologist Avery Gordon, a social haunting is a reminder and legacy of past social violence. It is a sense, a feeling, a way of thinking, an atmosphere that pervades within a community, influencing its future in myriad, perhaps unnoticed, ways. Our research will explore this concept from an Arts and Humanities perspective, shedding light on the role of architecture, artefacts, landscapes, sounds, poetry and graphic narrative in recalling 'barely visible' historical experiences and exploring the changing nature of community values. 

In this project we will, in partnership with our two case study communities, establish two '[Ghost] Co-Labs'. These project-long co-production spaces will bring together members of the project team, our arts collaborators, and community partner members to codesign a programme of activities that develop through phases. These will involve an investigative phase in which participants engage in multi faceted historical research led by an expert in heritage studies and a creative phase in which they use insights gained from these explorations to create arts-based outputs. These outputs will include three collectively-produced arts-based community outcomes: a one hour community radio broadcast formatted in mixed 'collage documentary' and radio art form; a small archive of workshop poetry; a small visual archive of comic strips. Through this process, we aim to attune to the often contested and sometimes barely visible processes of past- and present making that is forming ways in which communal lives are being lived as both our partner organisations and communities reshape and renew themselves in the face of new social challenges.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Impact Summary identifies a broad range of direct and indirect economic, societal and cultural beneficiaries. The two key beneficiaries will be our named partners (the Co-operative College and the South Yorkshire Community Branch of the trade union UNITE) and other interested parties that they can reach. The Co-operative College is a unique educational institution focussed on providing learning programmes and research to support the development of a successful and diverse co-operative sector. The six co-operative principles are key to its identity. A better understanding of the relation of historical heritage to the present - particularly its barely visible aspects - will strengthen the college's 'future negotiation' during a period of change. Specifically, the Rochdale Pioneers museum will benefit from initial work being carried out in the Co-operative College's archive and from the project creative arts products that will be inspired by the archive and the the National Co-operative Archive collection itself will benefit from holding the project archive. Importantly, the Co-operative College's schools network of over 800 schools will potentially benefit from curriculum resources inspired by the creative products that the project produces. The huge impact of co-operative heritage and history in the north of England is well known but further creative activity and research of the kind outlined here will deepen understandings of people, place and identity.

The Co-operative movement is on the cusp of new trajectories with new formations emerging. There are over 6,500 co-operatives in the UK. The College and its sister organisations such as Co-operatives UK will be able to reach communities of interest and disseminate the research and project practice not only nationally but internationally through its website, twitter feed, blogs and newsletters. 
As for UNITE the project will help the union to improve its understanding of the way historical matters that go back to the miners' strike of 1984-85 and beyond are still impacting in the local area and its membership. The community outputs will support the organisation in the creative vision of community activism that it is encouraging. For local community participants, the project will be an opportunity to ensure that their voices are heard and recognised; to explore arts-based activities which offer them alternative ways of expressing their stories; to make further connections within their communities through exploring topics which are often not discussed; and to explore what this means for the collective history, and future, of their communities. Activities such as the planned radio broadcast, poetry and comics archives and final 'Ghost Exchange' events will allow local communities to become involved in these explorations.

Beyond immediate impact among our named partners, the following parties will also benefit in terms of knowledge of the project and its outcomes and access to shared and archived materials: The Co-operative College/Unite in Schools Project; Workers' Education Association; CASS School of Community and Education, University of East London; School of Education and Health, Federation University Australia; Radical Arts/Radical Aesthetics network; Experience Barnsley museum; People's History Museum/Working Class Movement Library, Manchester/Salford. Significant and diverse Policy-maker groups who benefit will include Justice for Mineworkers Parliamentary Group; Southwell and Nottingham Diocese. Community groups and organisations benefitting will include: Pitmen Poets, Poets, Mexborough; Co-op, Rochdale; UNITE national education office; UNITE Northern Region community membership; Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33496</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Jim Mewday, the comics artist we've been working with, created a 4 page comic about the experience of the ghost lab in Barnsley.

The research has been reported to the community trade union Unite Community through its Yorkshire, Humberside and Durham regional structure and its South Yorkshire branch stucture by the project PI and research parter participants and a &amp;quot;Ghost Lab&amp;quot; is to be run at the HQ in 2016. Unite Community members have reported to Unite on how the social haunting project has enriched their community life: sample comments from the report presented to the Yorks, Humberside and Durham officer of Unite Community follow: John Taylor found the Ghost labs to be &amp;quot;not just a stimulating and creative experience, it was a deeply, no, more than that - a richly moving one&amp;quot;. Mark James believes the union's keen interest in the project has definitely brought benefits: &amp;quot;The Ghost labs have actually helped to revitalise the branch and have enabled us to reflect upon the difficulties that we face representing marginal, often very vulnerable members of society&amp;quot;. According to Mark, the Ghost labs have been &amp;quot;different from most academic research. They enabled expression, creating the basis of agency for people to gain a hold over their own lives in a supporting environment of solidarity&amp;quot; . 
2. The research has been reported to the Orgreave Truth and Justice campaign (a campaign relating to a call for a public Inquiry related to aspects of the Miners' Strike 1984-85) by the PI. As a result the project PI was consulted by the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign in relation to their legal submission to the Home Secretary, Theresa May
3. The project PI is currently in negotiation with the Rochdale Pioneers Museum at Rochdale to run further Ghost Labs there after the completion of AH/M009262/1 to support the museum's forward planning processes.
4. A ghost Lab will be run as part of the Co-op College Education Conference, Manchester April 22nd. A national audience of co-operators and teachers in co-op schools will be in attendance.
5. A bid made by the PI as Lead Applicant to disseminate the project at the 2016 Festival of Utopia has been successful. 

Since my list submission I have received more AHRC funding to develop this research. In 2016 I was awarded &amp;pound;15k augmented funding as lead Applicant for the project: &amp;quot;Opening the 'unclosed space' - Multiplying 'Ghost Labs' as intergenerational utopian practice&amp;quot;
The project grew out of live community collaboration within project: AH/M009262/1 Working with Social Haunting and made the following key contributions to the AHRC Festival theme of Community Futures and Utopias. It developed the theoretical and design aspects of the innovative intergenerational &amp;quot;Ghost Lab&amp;quot; community inquiry model first introduced in WwSH and extended the scope of the model into diverse and changing communities in North Staffordshire and in part of East London. It also showcased the Ghost Lab's creative capacity in two innovative ways by co-producing an intergenerational 'replay documentary theatre' performance in the main auditorium at the New Vic theatre in Newcastle under Lyme and by delivering poetry-, comic strip-, and 'instant replay theatre'-focussed Ghost Labs as part of the Somerset House Utopia Fair. 
I was accepted to both the AHRC Connected Communities Early Career Researchers Conference in early 2016 and also the full AHRC Connected Communities conference in late 2016.

Most recently, I have been awarded a grant under the AHRC Impact and Legacy funding stream as Principal Investigator on the project: : Creating Living Knowledge through Working with Social Haunting
 
This project builds on Working with a Social Haunting (AH/M009262/1) and AHRC Festival project Opening the 'Unclosed Space' to take our innovative Ghost Lab technique of 'Community Tarot' readings to new audiences in marginalised de-industrialised communities in the UK and, from there, to new national and international audiences. The proposal addresses two significant newly emergent agendas that have become prominent during the life of the projects. These are, first, around the impact of the Brexit vote registered in such communities in the 2016 EU Referendum and second, by extension, around the growth of nationalist political projects across Europe and more widely.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>35AD8DA6-0FAC-473B-90A6-27CED569390A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc4fbd253233.96346751</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered that our innovative &amp;quot;Ghost Lab&amp;quot; community co-production model offers an innovative approach to working with the past being present in the present as utopian immanence - a practice of &amp;quot;concrete utopia&amp;quot; in Bloch's terms (Bloch, 1995). The Ghost lab design draws specifically on the dialogic arts practice of Kester (2004) and the process-philosophy derived &amp;quot;participatory art-philosophy-political event design&amp;quot; principles of Massumi and Manning (Massumi, 2015, 78) to enact a theoretically interdisciplinary, arts-based, activist event-space that offers a space of hospitality and safety (see attached Visual/Other Evidence) in which to explore contested community pasts already. Qualitative data gathered suggests that the Ghost Lab works in a way to short circuit the conventional disjunction between social and economic, and psychological, cultural, aesthetic and spiritual aspects of community being-ness, making for a new mode of working with community futures. The PI will write a paper for a leading international journal defining the theoretical and practical character of the 'ghost lab' approach.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have been successful in being awarded an augmented funding as part of the 2016 Connected Communities Festival to develop a festival project called &amp;quot;Opening the 'Unclosed Space': Multiplying Ghost Labs as Intergenerational Utopian Practice&amp;quot; This project has grown out of live community collaboration within our current project: AH/M009262/1 Working with Social Haunting (WwSH) and will make the following key contributions to the Festival theme of Community Futures and Utopias.

 Two new partners - the New Vic and an autonomous co-operative youth project, Voice of Youth, based in Hackney - will be connected into the established WwSH partnership already made up of the Co-operative College, South Yorkshire Branch of Unite Community, artists and academic researchers
