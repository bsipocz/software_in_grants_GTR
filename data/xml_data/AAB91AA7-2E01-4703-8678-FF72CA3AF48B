Yet, the available evidence, mainly on acute conditions, shows that there are large inequalities in access to care. The goal of this project is to understand the role of health systems in shaping gender, geographical, and socio-economic inequalities in access to continuing effective care for chronic diseases in low-, middle- and high income countries, by combining two unique large data sets (the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) individual cohorts and Environmental Profile of a Community's Health (EPOCH) community profiles). These contain individual-level data from a cohort of over 170,000 individuals age 35-70 in over 600 communities in 21 countries at all levels of development (Canada, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Poland, Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Colombia, Iran, Palestine, Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe), including their socio-economic characteristics, clinical parameters (e.g. blood pressure, ECG, bloods, urine), treatment, health care utilisation, and outcomes, and so far followed up for 3 years, as well as profiles of the communities in which they live, including health facilities and availability and price of medicines. We will identify those with or at risk of cardiovascular disease and assess their probabilities of being diagnosed, treated, and controlled, according to their gender, socio-economic status, and urban/rural residence in each country. We will seek plausible explanations for observed differences, drawing on the literature on access to care and adherence and treatment (including two systematic reviews we have recently completed), as well as research on the roles of gender, rurality, and socio-economic inequalities. In particular we will look at characteristics of the health systems, such as co-payments, price and availability of drugs, and wider characteristics of societies, such as gender empowerment. The project has strong links to policy through global and national professional organisations, thereby increasing the potential for the findings to inform global debates and will be translated into action within countries. It explicitly addresses two of the three of the ESRC's strategic priorities (and their components): how to understand behaviour and risks at multiple levels and a variety of contexts (especially on public and preventative health) and a vibrant and fair society (including internationally and by exploiting data from ongoing longitudinal studies).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of the research include populations in the study countries affected or at risk of CVD. These populations may benefit from improved understanding among health professionals, policy makers and researchers on barriers to CVD prevention and treatment activities. However, this is clearly dependent on the project team engaging with policy agencies to inform and convince them of the key messages arising from the project findings and encouraging policy agencies to implement effective policies and services to reduce barriers to CVD date. 
For such benefit to occur, the key agencies that will need to be engaged with include: government ministries (particularly Ministry of Health) and departments at the central and local level; the WHO; key multilateral and bilateral agencies such as the European Commission, the World Bank, USAID, CIDA and DFID; and civil society organisations providing health support. Individuals at these agencies will benefit from the research by increasing their knowledge and understanding on the issue of access to CVD prevention and treatment activities; and being able to utilise empirical findings to help develop appropriate evidence-based policies and services.
In order to ensure that these agencies have the opportunity to benefit from the research we will utilise our professional networks such as the World Heart Federation and its national members, and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies and its partners, including WHO, the European Commission, and World Bank, in order to raise understanding of the subject, the research, and the key policy messages. This will be achieved through a variety of activities such as presentations at key meetings, workshops, and conferences. We also plan to hold a workshop on the study findings, with participants invited from disciplines of sociology, economics, political science, and public health and epidemiology. We will also utilise traditional and new media opportunities to increase coverage of the key messages arising from the research to engage as wide an audience as possible, including the general public. These activities can utilise the Communications Departments at LSHTM and the others project partners.
Our work will also benefit academics by improving conceptual, methodological and empirical understanding on CVD prevention and treatment activities in LMICs. Publications of academic papers, presentations at conferences, and the project workshop will help ensure that other academics have the opportunity to benefit from the research. We will utilise the networks of universities involved in the PURE project to maximise benefits among academic partners and strengthen information sharing between them (please see the Academic Beneficiaries Section for further details). 
These impact-related activities will take place as part of a broader strategy to develop a clear plan of activities, clear messages and activities targeted for specific audiences, and evaluating the pathways to impact through the use of a range of indicators These indicators include: the number of key meetings, workshops, and conferences in which the research findings have been presented or discussed; the successful completion of the LSHTM workshop and any associated outputs and spin offs; the number of academic publications and associated statistics; and types of media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156423</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PURE Study Collaborator Meeting (Rome)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1085201-BE09-4BC3-9B1B-EACEA1C80294</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To present preliminary findings from our analyses to the PURE study collaborators and involved graduate students from the 25 participating countries around the world.

This has led to our team's deeper engagement with the World Heart Federation, which is the world's only global body composed of over 200 national heart and professional associations from over 100 countries, dedicated to leading the fight against heart disease and stroke.

Given our expertise in health systems research, our team has collaborated with the World Heart Federation on several initiatives, including participating in the Third Cardiovascular Combination Pharmacotherapy Global Summit in Mexico City in 2016, which met to develop an action plan to make improve global access to a form of secondary prevention for CVD, known as polypills. This treatment combines medicines such as aspirin, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, which are proven, cost-effective interventions in patients with known CVD and are recommended by most major cardiology societies and health organisations.

Members of our research team have also led the development of three World Heart Federation Global Roadmaps to improve control of rheumatic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and elevated cholesterol. The Roadmaps are designed to translate existing knowledge of best practices, barriers, and solutions into practical strategies for improved cardiovascular health. They serve as models so countries can meet their commitments to develop or update national non-communicable disease plans using the framework provided by the World Health Organization's Global Action Plan.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EA98758D-D7F9-4A94-A5C2-9734F6F161D1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e77369f31b78.20548408</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our work used a unique dataset with information from individuals, their households and communities in 21 countries to better understand the role of health systems in shaping inequalities in access to effective preventive care for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is now the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in countries at all levels of economic development. Analyses focussed on the use of combination therapy to prevent the recurrence of a cardiovascular event in those with a history of CVD (called secondary prevention), and on the management of hypertension (or high blood pressure), which is a common and important risk factor for CVD.

We found notable differences across countries in the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in the use of secondary prevention and its determinants. However, in countries where use was relatively high, its distribution tended to be pro-poor, meaning that uptake was more common among poorer than among richer individuals. Conversely, in countries where use was low, the direction of the inequality tended to be more pro-rich. In both cases, inequalities were typically driven by differences in household wealth, which may seem counterintuitive where pro-poor distributions were observed. Older age was another key driver of pro-poor distributions; while being female, married, better educated, located in a rural area and higher drug prices tended to favour use among the rich.

Our work examining differences across countries at each stage of the hypertension management pathway (i.e. its detection, treatment with medications, and control) found positive associations between national wealth and the proportion of individuals who had their hypertension detected, treated, and controlled. Conversely, the magnitude of wealth-related inequalities for each of the three outcomes tended to increase and become more pro-rich as countries became poorer. However, even at similar levels of national wealth some countries are able to achieve better and more equally distributed outcomes than others, which reflects differences in context, including differences in the effectiveness of national health systems.

Examining more closely the role of health systems in achieving hypertension control, we found that higher medicine prices/lower affordability reduced the likelihood of control, while better availability of medicines and primary care from private providers increased this likelihood. Importantly, the effects of these characteristics were stronger in poorer countries where health systems tend to be weaker. Beyond the health system, we also examined the effect of different forms of social capital on hypertension management. Social capital may be defined as the features of social organisation that facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit. We found that social capital increases the likelihood of hypertension detection and control, but not treatment use, and it does this primarily through increased social participation. Similar to our findings related to health system characteristics, these effects were present only in poorer countries. We suggest that such social participation helps individuals to compensate for weaknesses in the health system by providing an informal source of care and support, and thereby achieve better hypertension management outcomes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings raise awareness of the role of health systems in CVD control, and are informing discussions on effective control strategies, particularly where resources are scarce or poorly distributed, where health systems are weak, and where evidence for decision making is currently lacking.

Our engagement with the World Heart Federation gives our findings global policy impact, while filtering down to regional and national levels via the Federation's 200+ member organisations, including professional societies and foundations in &amp;gt;100 countries. We have presented our findings to representatives of these organisations, at meetings in London and Mexico City, and they tell us that they will use them in developing clinical guidelines and training curricula, and in informing their advocacy activities in relation to health policy.

Our findings will achieve further impact at the national level as a result of our ongoing relationship with PURE study collaborators, to whom we presented findings at an investigators' meeting in Rome. They have strong links to national and state-level health ministries, civil society, the pharmaceutical industry and academia, and many are also regarded as opinion leaders in cardiovascular health.

Finally, key empirical findings will inform post graduate-level public health teaching and learning in the investigators' institutions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D0A183E4-7B88-4CF4-B522-579293A4A47B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de13d13f2f71.99917988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Third Cardiovascular Combination Pharmacotherapy Global Summit (Mexico City)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8969DA92-909A-49DD-BD2B-E076E41624FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A network of thought leaders made up of physicians, researchers, economists, policymakers and industry experts met to agree an action plan to make 'polypills' more widely available worldwide for preventing cardiovascular disease.
