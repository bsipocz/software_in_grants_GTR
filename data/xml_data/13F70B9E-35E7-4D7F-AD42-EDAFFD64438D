lymphatic system) are broadly grouped into two types known as Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) and the more common non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).||For HL, most patients will be treated with chemotherapy, in some cases with radiotherapy as well, and overall the prognosis is very good 80% of patients will be alive 5 years after their diagnosis. The survival rate does vary according to the stage of disease (how many sites in the body are affected), and so efforts are being made to improve treatment for patients with advanced disease. The MRC LY09 trial assessed whether giving combinations of more than 4 different chemotherapy drugs (multi-drug regimens, MDR) gave better patient outcomes than the more standard 4-drug combination (know as ABVD). The trial involved over 800 patients, half of whom were chosen at random to receive ABVD and half the MDR. Patients in both groups did well, but there was no clear benefit to giving the more complex combination in terms of the proportion of patients who remained alive and free from recurrence of their lymphoma.||The MRC has also completed a trial (LY10) in a type of NHL known as Burkitts lymphoma (BL). This is a rare, but very aggressive type of lymphoma.||In the past, BL was diagnosed using simple pathology stains (dyes used on small samples of tissue) which are widely available. Virtually all previously published clinical trials in this condition have used this method. It has, however, been known for some years that a definite diagnosis should include a study of the chromosomes (in which DNA is stored). For the first time, we were able to use DNA studies (known as FISH) in a group of patients who would, in the past using older techniques, have been diagnosed as having BL. We showed that this diagnosis was correct in only 50% of patients, while the remaining 50% had other types of lymphoma. The practical outcome of this discovery will be that non-BL patients can avoid the extremely toxic and unpleasant treatment which is necessary for true BL.||An additional feature of this trial was an attempt to reduce the dose of methotrexate - a necessary but very difficult drug without lowering cure rates. This was successfully accomplished and the new dose-modified chemotherapy should now become a standard treatment worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Lymphomas (cancers of the lymphatic system) are broadly grouped into two types known as Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) and the more common non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).||For HL, most patients will be treated with chemotherapy, in some cases with radiotherapy as well, and overall the prognosis is very good 80% of patients will be alive 5 years after their diagnosis.
