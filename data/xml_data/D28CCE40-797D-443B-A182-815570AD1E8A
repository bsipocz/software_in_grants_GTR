Recent studies have shown the role of food in the demonstration of care (eg Kaplan 2000) and the negotiation of power relationships between adults and children (Grieshaber, 1997). It is central to the construction of children?s identities (James et al., 2009) both in families (Wills et al., 2008) as well as amongst peers (Valentine, 2000).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project advances knowledge exchange between academics, practitioners, carers and educators in relation to the use of food in the care of looked after children. It will co-produce, with Partner Agencies and the Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services, a training package on the symbolic use of food in residential and foster care and design an interactive assessment tool to aid residential staff and foster carers? reflections on the child in their care and the food practices which are in place.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will monitor how these tools have been integrated into practice. In addition, the team will conduct a critical reflection on the process of partnership working and co-production in academic research. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have a range of economic and societal impacts. It will impact directly on the effectiveness of public services in terms of enhancing carers' skills and knowledge as well as equipping them with a tool for practice, thus enhancing work performance and service delivery. On a broader level, the training and assessment tools will feed into local policy on food in looked after care, moving it beyond nutrition to consider the wider social and emotional impacts of food and the practices that surround it. As the FaCS project from which this follow on application began to illustrate, helping staff look critically at their practice around food can alter and shape organisational culture and the lived experience of the children being looked after. 

As mentioned by our Partner Agencies, involvement in the project will equip non academic colleagues with experience of applying research data to practice and allow a creative network of academics and practitioners to be established. This multi-disciplinary approach has impact on the academic representatives (from social work and sociology) sharing knowledge and expertise as well as providing opportunities to devise innovative approaches/tools.

In the first instance the project will work with staff and foster carers within the partner agencies (one local authority, one voluntary organisation and one private foster agency). By supporting these adults to look at the symbolic aspects of food and to reflect on how related practices are delivered and received, the everyday experiences of children will be enhanced. The project aims to extend the debate on food beyond nutrition to think about how food can illuminate how a child may be feeling, what they may be bringing to the care setting and how they might best be supported. Thus this model encourages consideration of how they have understood the child and how practice around food is being managed. Foster carers and residential staff will benefit from gaining knowledge of symbolic communication at a broad level as well as greater insight into the needs of the chidlren that they are looking after. By receiving training, using the assessment tool and being involved in peer support they will develop knowledge and skills which can be both built up as well as shared with others. Equipping them with this should increase confidence as well as potentially free up some of their concerns around expressing and exploring care and help them better understand some of the behaviours that they are having to live with day to day. By engaging from the start with frontline staff in the devising of materials we aim not only to 'train' (increase function) but to help people learn (increase staff/carers adaptive capacity). Hence, this project will enhance and augment reflexive practice.

Managers/foster support workers will benefit from having a tool they can use with staff/carers to look at children's behaviours and how adults are responding. The tool will encourage staff/carers to reflexively consider their own actions and that of the child. This will allow supervisors to monitor how carers are understanding the children that they care for and provide a vehicle to tackle/explore issues of care and control as well as values and beliefs. CELCIS will embed the conceptual/ theoretical findings from the previous FaCS study and the practice tools from this proposed piece of work into national training. It is expected that the triangular model of delivery which is being proposed could be used for other training/practice purposes within public sector organisations. 

The training package, assessment tool and peer support model will be delivered initially by partner organisations to their own staff. These will then be rolled out nationally through the uploading of the materials on the project website.The impact of this learning on the wider social service sector will be maximised through the involvement of IRISS and accessing their extensive network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Deakin University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with HEAL project, Deakin University, Melbourne</gtr:description><gtr:id>33198394-C6A5-4353-9B99-36E23F20A98B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs include delivery of two, whole day, training workshops to foster carers, support staff and residential workers in two large voluntary sector childcare agencies in Victoria (Berry Street and Wesley Mission).

The workshop was attended by residential staff, residential managers, policy and research staff as well as senior managers. Participants were very much engaged with the materials and participated in the interactive elements of the workshop. They were able to relate the Food for Thought findings to those of their own practice and began to identify ways in which the resources could be used in their practice settings.

Following the workshop, a member of the academic team was invited to meet with senior managers to explore ways that Food for Thought could be integrated into the services provided by Berry Street. As a result, a pilot has been set up in which all new and existing staff in the therapeutic residential services will be involved in Reflective Workshops and will be expected to use the additional resources. The aim is to evaluate the impact of this with a view to it being rolled out to all child care services provided by Berry Street.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54648514a6e4d6.12952137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of Food for Thought Resources</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B795970-94B2-4FC9-90FF-5648AE859535</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The day long event at the University of Stirling aimed to launch the Food for Thought resources to a range of audiences. It was attended by policy makers, representatives from the Care Inspectorate, practitioners, local authority and voluntary organisation senior managers. Members of the steering group as well as the academic team presented the Food for Thought practice based resources as well as discussed the experience of partnership working and co-production. 
The event stimulated a great deal of discussion. Participants were involved in small group discussion on the resources which was recorded by the project team. Participants engaged with the materials and were able to quickly apply the key concepts underpinning the resources to their own practice settings.

Following the launch we were approached by ISP (a large fostering agency in England) who asked if they could send staff to one of the 'Train the Trainer' events we had organised. We were also asked to present to the national Care Inspectorate Children's Services Development Day. Subsequent to the launch five different local authorities sent staff to Train the Trainer events as well as seven voluntary and private sector agencies working with Looked After Children, children with disabilities and youth services.

Interestingly, the workshop was also attended by staff from a homeless service for adults as well as two services for children with disabilities. 
Each workshop prompted a high level of debate. Participants clearly engaged with the materials being presented and, later, were able to identify ways in which they could promote the resources within their own organisations.

Following the workshops, we were approached to deliver training in Australia to two child care providers, to facilitate a number of peer support groups and to offer further advice to those setting up and running their own workshops.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464875202ab52.86277166</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Peer Support Group (SRCCWA, Glasgow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EB33538-B055-43D8-ABA2-C30FAD9BB20D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was facilitated by a member of the steering group using the Peer Support Guidance.

Using questions and reflections from the Peer Support Guidance, the group were helped to think together about different approaches they might take around food and to hypothesise about what they and their children might be communicating in relation to their food practices.

Following the group, evaluations were undertaken by FCA staff. These highlighted that the group had made changes in their day to day practices around food. Many stated that they felt more aware of what children might be using food for and, in addition, what they may have been communicating in their expectations around food routines and rituals.

Participants included foster carers, residential workers, social workers and managers from the three partner agencies. Each workshop had a theme (e.g. how do you like to be 'trained'? relating knowledge to practice) and concentrated on co producing each of the five key resources. Participants were able to share their views on existing training, what worked for them (and not) and were able to suggest excellent ways to disseminate the ideas promoted by the Food for Thought Project.

The main impact was the contribution made by the workshop participants in developing the five key Food for Thought resources. Their involvement allowed us to create resources which are meaningful and useful to carers and practitioners. In addition, participants became ambassadors for the project within their own organisations. They promoted the resources, encouraged participation in the pilot Reflective Workshops and Peer Support Groups and disseminated the work to their own networks. In addition, they were able to integrate Food for Thought into existing training and practice. For example, one member of staff from Perth and Kinross was able to change the training provided to prospective foster and adoptive parents to include information on the Food for Thought Project and the key concepts underpinning it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54649e75467845.48146611</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>53238</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scottish Graduate School Doctoral Training Centre</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>3744F0D5-D35F-4EB4-9640-32616C9FC951</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b845c914f15.38783766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>29364</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Post Doctoral Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4EDDB7F4-36F8-4C3C-9DF3-94EFE96444A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b7e40706360.95194329</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Narrative Impact Report Food for Thought Project 
Ref number: ES/J020745/1


Food for Thought (FFT) was a knowledge exchange project which aimed to generate, deliver and sustain a range of resources relating to the symbolic use of food and food practices in foster and residential care. Data originally drawn from a previous ESRC funded project (Food Practices in an Institutional Context: Children, Care and Control, Ref number: RES-000-23-1581) formed the basis for the resources. These were devised and piloted with three agency partners (Perth and Kinross Council, Aberlour Child Care Trust and Foster Care Associates), all of which provided residential and/or foster care services to children in Scotland. 

The project added to the knowledge base and skill set of both residential and foster carers, as well as their managers and supervising social workers. These developments not only related to food based practices, but extended to promote understanding of the ways in which adults and children communicate through symbolic means. The resources targeted aspects of direct care and aimed to improve practice effectiveness as well as, in turn, enhance the quality of life of looked after children and young people. 

One key element of the project was the sustainability of the practice resources. To this end, materials are not only freely available to individuals and organisations on the project website (www.foodforthoughtproject.info) but they also include guidance for those wishing to deliver face to face training or to facilitate peer support groups. Furthermore, partnerships with IRISS (Institute for Research and Innovation in the Social Services) and CELCIS (Centre for Excellence in Looked After Children in Scotland) have ensured that the resources and materials devised in this year long project will remain in the public domain. IRISS will continue to service the project website whilst CELCIS have embedded aspects of the project into their teaching on the MSc in Advanced Residential Child Care. 

The project's practice-based resources and training workshops for practitioners, trainers and research managers have been delivered at local, national and international levels. The project outputs have already informed policy and practice in eight local authorities in Scotland, in five centres in the south of England and in one organisation in Australia. This impact funding enabled us to advance knowledge exchange between academics, practitioners, carers and educators in relation to food practices and child care nationally, within the wider UK and internationally (leading to links with child care organisations and universities in Finland, Germany and Australia). The growing impact from this project means that it has been identified as a key Impact Case Study for REF2020 for the School of Applied Social Science at the University of Stirling.

Summary of how findings are being used
Since the launch of FFT in November 2013, we are aware that a number of organisations have and continue to use the training and resources produced by the Food for Thought project. For example, Perth and Kinross Council have incorporated FFT materials into their induction training for new foster carers, The Scottish Residential Child Care Workers Association have run FFT peer support groups and Berry Street (a childcare organisation in Melbourne, Australia) are using the FFT Reflective Workshops as part of mandatory induction training for all their residential staff. Reflective workshops have also been delivered in house by one large NHS authority (NHS Lothian) and by Foster Care Associates in four of their regional areas in Scotland. 

The FFT academic team have continued to support the use of the resources in practice. For example, a wide range of practitioners, foster carers and managers attended the four Train the Trainer workshops held at the University of Stirling. These included representatives from across the UK (e.g. Dundee City Council, Snowdon Residential School, Foster Plus, North Lanarkshire Council, West Lothian Council, Glasgow Simon Community, Edinburgh City Council, Harmeny Residential School, Integrated Services Programme [Kent and the Southeast]). These workshops aimed to increase confidence in those looking to deliver FFT workshops in their organisations. We have had on going contact with a number of these participants who are looking to, or have, integrated FFT into their training for staff and carers as well as their day to day practice. We have also facilitated seven peer support sessions in a wide range of settings and organisations and delivered an additional three reflective workshops. We have received requests to deliver workshops in Liverpool and in Fife and plan to run these in the early autumn 2015. 

To date, the FFT team has collected data on the initial impact of attending reflective workshops and peer support groups (approx. 170 foster carers and practitioners). The vast majority of participants ranked the materials highly or extremely relevant to their care of children. Many identified areas of practice that they would do differently as a result of attending the sessions. These included: reviewing how they managed mealtimes, greater flexibility around routines, thinking about what the child might be telling them through their use of food, considering how they might use food to let children know that they care about them. Interestingly, participants also identified issues that they would want to discuss further in supervision or in subsequent peer support meetings. The following quotes from evaluation forms and interviews are typical:

I found the training day really informative. It's probably one of the best training days I've been to for a long time it really opened my eyes to how we used food in Residential Care I want all the staff to go on the training (Residential Manager)

At the training session they did say it would make us question our habits as adults, not just the children, our rules, our priorities and such like and it has done that! (Foster Carer). 

I think it's been really positive. I've had carers come up and say 'you've been involved in that [FFT] and what was it like, what's it all about' and . It seems people are really interested (Foster Carer)

Evolution of the project
The project has grown in a range of ways since the end of the funding period. Whilst as stated above, there continues to be growth in demand for FFT team to facilitate workshops and peer support groups we also have an increase in numbers of organisations delivering the reflective workshops themselves. This is an indicator of the resources becoming more embedded in the practice community and 'ownership' transferring from the FFT team to practice. In line with this, we have been approached by two agencies (NHS Lothian and FCA) who would like us to bring together organisations who are using the FFT materials. They are keen to look at ways to consolidate and build on the work of the project and to learn from each other. It is planned that the first of these meetings will take place in October 2015. 

The demand to establish an ongoing network around FFT has been replicated in the experiences of members of the steering group. Importantly, whilst the project funding ended in May 2014, the steering group has continued to meet on a quarterly basis. This group continues to share information about 'best practice', lessons learned from using FFT resources and strategies to improve direct care practice. The group has exchanged knowledge about wider policy and practice initiatives and have looked to the group for support and advice. 

Although it was a knowledge exchange project, the team also undertook empirical research exploring the experience of partnership working, co-production and knowledge exchange. This work has shed light on factors which contribute to sustained partnerships and the embedding of research into policy and practice. Two refereed journals articles are being prepared to present the findings from this aspect of the study. In addition, funding was secured from the Scottish Graduate School Doctoral Training Centre for a PhD studentship which will critically examine knowledge exchange and research impact using FFT as a case study. As part of this, follow up data concerning the use of FFT resources and their direct impact on practice will be gathered over a further three year period (including PhD fieldwork in Australia) in order to chart the international impact journey which began in Melbourne with colleagues from Deakin University. This international link has also led to the joint writing of a journal article with Helen Skouteris, Professor in Developmental Psychology and Dr Rachael Cox at Deakin University, Melbourne: &amp;quot;Day-to-day food practices and physical activity routines in residential care: 'The odds are against you'&amp;quot; as well as to a joint National Health and Medical Research Council grant application which is in preparation and will combine FFT with their &amp;quot;Healthy Eating &amp;amp; Active Living&amp;quot; HEAL project

We have been surprised by the international interest in the FFT resources. Information gathered from the project website indicates that the resources have been downloaded and have attracted attention from across the world. As of March 2015 there have been over 4,000 page views, including 2605 downloads of our resources. The staff handbook, children's leaflet, reflective tool and peer support guidance have been translated into Finnish and in addition, we have been invited to facilitate FFT workshops in Australia and Germany as well as had requests to present on the materials in Ireland, England and across Scotland.

Challenges to achieve impact 

The project faced a number of challenges to achieving impact. They included the following:
1. Staff and carers reported feeling 'overwhelmed' by training and policy initiatives. In the development workshops that we ran at the start of the project, they also stated that they found it hard to make links between all the different training they had received. Finally, many described difficulties in applying new knowledge to practice. The FFT team overcame these difficulties by creating a suite of resources for staff and carers that targeted a range of learning styles and which allowed staff and carers to be in control of the pace and volume of knowledge. Many of the resources refer to other key training (e.g. attachment theory, relationship based practice) and how FFT connects to these other arenas of practice knowledge. Finally, the team provided a range of tools that could be used in practice to support knowledge transfer (e.g. the Reflective Tool). 

2. A number of partner agencies reported pressure of work and that this restricted or made their involvement more challenging. To overcome this, we offered to facilitate peer support groups and to meet with senior managers to help embed FFT and to support agency representatives in their quest to do this. Agency partners used some of the steering group time to discuss strategies they had employed within their organisations (for example in house 'steering groups' as well as devising a FFT implementation plan). These tools were also shared with other organisational representatives. 

3. Project funding was available for one year only. This resulted in limited opportunities to robustly assess and analyse impact. To overcome this we have been able to secure full funding for a three year PhD studentship which will look critically at impact using FFT as a case study. We have also embedded basic data capture techniques into the website to allow us to track numbers of visits to the site and the number of resources that were downloaded. A number of agencies who have employed FFT resources have committed to feeding back evaluation data and have put in place ways to track the use of FFT materials in their organisation (for example FCA have developed a FFT learning and activities log which tracks all FFT related activities, evaluations and reported impacts).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4011C9E9-94FA-4F44-81B6-D6611B2CA194</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>553f7a116f5c71.26219674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Working closely in partnership with three care providers (Aberlour Childcare Trust, Foster Care Associates and Perth &amp;amp; Kinross Council) and two national institutions (CELCIS - Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland and IRISS-Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services), the Food for Thought project built on data produced in our ESRC funded study of food practices in residential care. The partnership co-produced a series of resources which translated, applied and developed this previous data in ways which appear, from initial feedback, to have been relevant, useful and sustainable to residential practitioners and foster carers of looked after children. Resources were developed in face to face monthly meetings with partners and during development workshops involving residential and foster carers. 
During this co-production process it became clear that the three resources outlined by the partnership in the initial funding application could be adapted. In workshops, carers and staff described their experience of being overwhelmed by the volume of stand-alone training they had attended, the often generic content of training materials and their desire not just to be taught but to learn. Consequently, the Food for Thought group worked together to produce five key resources catering for different learning styles which aimed not only to provide information about food based practice but also opportunities for reflection, application and links to other training and learning. 
The Resources
An interactive, activity based Reflective Workshop (with a Facilitators' Pack including all support materials) was created to raise awareness of the symbolic use of food in care settings and to provide opportunities for participants to share reflections and practices. An Online Interactive Introduction was devised for individuals or staff groups to introduce or revisit core Food for Thought concepts. Responding to carers' concerns that training can often be too 'abstract' and disconnected from day to day practice, we developed three resources which helped them to focus on the individual children or the food based issues currently being faced (Reflective Tool, JOTIT Notebook and Peer Support Guidance). These resources support reflection and analysis of individual children or food related concerns and provide a mechanism whereby issues can be recorded, brought to supervision or discussed in a peer support forum. In addition, we produced a short monograph summarising wider academic research on children, food and care. 
All the resources are free to download from our website www.foodforthoughtproject.info
It would appear that the co-production and take up of these resources has gone some way to meeting our three key conceptual, instrumental and capacity building objectives: to promote awareness and understanding of the symbolic use of food; to equip foster carers and residential staff with the knowledge, skills and resources to observe and understand children's food practices; and to facilitate staff/carers' reflections on their own food related interventions and how these might be maximised to therapeutic ends. 
As part of the project, the challenging process of developing with rather than for carers and practitioners was evaluated by conducting interviews with all partners and carers involved in the design and piloting of the resources. What was striking was the centrality of relationships to the experience of participation and indeed to the success of the project. Participants described a genuine sense of ownership of the materials, passion and enthusiasm for the subject matter and a desire to promote and maintain the use of the resources within their own, and other, organisations. 
We continue to receive much interest in the resources from a range of service providers, including those providing care to adults. We are keen to extend our work to residential care for older people.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has attracted significant attention from researchers across the UK and internationally. A number of our resources have been translated into German and Finnish and we have provided workshop training sessions to colleagues in Australia. The partnership will continue to promote the resources as well as disseminate findings relating to co- production and partnership working. We are currently writing two academic journal articles on data relating to knowledge exchange and co-production. All partners have also committed to, and set up, an evaluation of the uptake and use of the resources over a five year period. The data generated through this evaluation, as well as our impact strategy, will be reported in two practice based articles. 
The project launch at Stirling University involved 90 practitioners, academics and policy makers. This led to take up of the resources by a care provider in England (ISP) as well as an invitation to present to the 150 members of the Scottish Care Inspectorate. We have presented to academic audiences in Germany (Eichst&amp;auml;tt and Vechta), Australia, Ireland, England and Scotland and have planned future events including presenting at an international conference (BAPSCAN 2015). Our project Briefing has been sent to our research database, as well as distributed via CELCIS, IRISS and the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships.
Academics within the social studies of childhood, alternative care for children and the sociology of food have shown interest in how we have translated our findings to practice. For example, colleagues working with the HEAL project (Deakin University, Melbourne) drew on our project to explore the process of engaging staff and in the co-production of research based practice tools. They have asked that Food for Thought materials be translated into an online training module which will form part of a course they are producing aimed at residential staff in Australia.
Our conceptual work and resources have also been used in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching at Stirling University and in the training of residential and social work staff, such as the MSc Advanced Residential Child Care at the University of Strathclyde.

The resources developed by the FFT team have also been taken forward by a number of practice and child care organisations. This encompasses adult providers of care (residential staff, foster/adoptive parents/carers, supervising social workers and managers) as well as children (those looked after away from home, with physical or learning disabilities or with emotional and behavioural difficulties). 
Food for Thought has already impacted on how staff and carers understand and respond to the food practices of children in their care. This has been demonstrated in workshop evaluation forms, feedback from partner agencies and spontaneous contact from staff and carers. They describe feeling more confident in reflecting on food based behaviours, more aware of the symbolic meaning of food and of it's the therapeutic potential.
In order to support practice staff to run Reflective Workshops within their organisations, we delivered three Train the Trainer events (totalling 50 trainers from across Scotland and 10 from Germany, Australia and England). In addition, we have been invited to facilitate six Peer Support Groups and to run two further Reflective Workshops. These activities have an economic impact (staff facilitate their own workshops rather than paying for external training) and a societal impact (staff and carers already report a change in direct practice and improved awareness of behaviours around food). 
We anticipate that these carers and practitioners will continue to promote the concepts underpinning Food for Thought and will be committed to shifting cultures of care around food. By providing a triangular model of knowledge exchange (group learning through Reflective Workshops, individual reflection/assessment using the Reflective Tool, and group discussion and problem solving using the Peer Support Model) we argue that Food for Thought is becoming a self-sustaining cycle of practice. We anticipate that once established in organisations, new staff or carers will be inducted into this approach and that, as a result, the quality of care for children and support given to staff will improve. As one participant stated: 'I found the session extremely helpful in providing clarity of thought and in highlighting the importance the role of food practices has in residential care'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8830E42D-F404-4C9A-BCC1-B18C7B9DD74F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>553f87818ec374.67372335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.foodforthoughtproject.info</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Foster Care Associates integration of Food for Thought into training module for foster carers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5918DF06-0F32-4704-AEA2-BE56263FC52C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Foster Care Associates, a national fostering agency, have integrated Food for Thought into their 'living with strangers' training programme.
