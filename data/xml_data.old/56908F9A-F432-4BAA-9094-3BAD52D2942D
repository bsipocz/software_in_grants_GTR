Yet improved predictions are essential in order to quantify the risk of coastal erosion, which is significant in its own right and also one of the main mediators of coastal flood risk. Whilst 'bottom-up' process-based models provide valuable evidence about hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphodynamic processes in the short term, their predictive accuracy over scales of decades is for the time being fundamentally limited. Meanwhile, behavioural systems models, that focus on the main processes and feedback mechanisms that regulate coastal form have been shown to have predictive capability at the mesoscale (10-100 years and 10-100 km). However, their application has been limited to a rather narrow sub-set of coastal forms. 
The iCoast project is based upon a hierarchical systems concept which combines (i) the beneficial features of process-based models, (ii) a new generation of coastal behavioural systems models, and (iii) an extended approach to coastal systems mapping, which can be used to systematise and formalise different sources of knowledge about coastal behaviour. All the software developed within iCoast will be open source and OpenMI compliant.
The research is focussed upon four deliverables that have been identified as major challenges in the NERC Natural Hazards Theme: 
Deliverable 1 will be an overall systems framework. The successful approach to coastal systems mapping developed by French et al. will be extended and applied to all of the England and Wales, making use of a new systems mapping tool. These new coastal systems maps can both supersede the coastal cells and sub-cells currently used in shoreline management planning and provide an evidence-based framework for more quantitative modelling. Therein, hydrodynamic and sediment transport coastal area models will be implemented at a broad spatial scale in order to provide evidence of wave and tidal forcings and sediment pathways. The systems framework will be implemented in open source software tools and coupled with methods for uncertainty analysis. 
Deliverable 2 will provide a new generation of behavioural geomorphic modules, which can be linked to enable simulation of coupled coastal-estuary-offshore landform behaviour at a meso-scale. Existing reduced complexity behavioural modules, several of which are held in-house within the iCoast consortium (SCAPE, ASMITA, various versions of 1-line beach models) will be reviewed and development and incremental improvement opportunities will be identified. They will be researched intensively by a team with unique experience of this type of model development. The scope of data-based modules that can exploit the growing datasets from coastal observatories will also be extended. The models will be integrated within a systems framework in order to study emergent properties and explore key sensitivities. 
Deliverable 3 will entail application and validation of two distinct coastal regions: the Suffolk Coast (Sub-Cell 3c) and Liverpool Bay (Sub-Cells 11a/11b), exploring the sensitivities of these coastal regions to changes in sediment supply resulting from sea-level rise, climate change and coastal management scenarios. This will yield the results needed for high impact publication and the demonstrations that are essential to build confidence in new approaches being transferred into practice. 
Deliverable 4 will facilitate knowledge transfer of the new methods through a range of dissemination mechanisms, including tutorials, manuals and knowledge transfer workshops. Our open source modelling strategy will initiate a community modelling approach in the coastal research community, at the same time as maximising access by practitioners to the knowledge generated at a time when requirements for coastal adaptation urgently require new predictive capability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries from the research fall into two main categories: 
1. The worldwide coastal research community, who recognise the difficult problem of mesoscale coastal prediction, and hence will be eager to take up new methodologies. This is evidenced by the rapid uptake of the SCAPE model, which has now been applied in New Zealand and the Great Lakes as well as at several sites in the UK. 
2. Coastal practitioners in the UK and worldwide, urgently need new mesoscale predictions of coastal change in order to manage the risks of coastal erosion and coastal flooding. These coastal risks are profoundly influenced by the long term behaviour of coastal sediment systems, but existing predictive approaches are severely limited, especially in conditions of long term change. Coastal practitioners include those in government and its agencies (e.g. the Environment Agency) and those in local authorities with responsibility for coastal management and adaptation. Whilst the focus of the research is upon UK coasts, the leading UK coastal consultants (e.g. Halcrow, HR Wallingford, Royal Haskoning) have considerable international businesses, so the UK is expected to benefit through the exploitation of iCoast science by these organisations in their international businesses. 
Ultimately, coastal communities will benefit from more sustainable coastal management that is based upon dependable predictions of coastal change. This will help to reduce the risks from flooding and coastal erosion and help to ensure that the costs of coastal management do not become unmanageable in future, even in the context of a changing climate. Improved and evidence-based coastal management will also help to sustain coastal ecosystems, which are threatened by sea level rise and coastal squeeze and protected under the Habitats and Birds Directive. 
The benefits from the research will derive from the developed methods for enhancing understanding and predicting processes of coastal change. Enhanced understanding will be delivered in particular via the new tools for systems mapping, which have already proved to be a worthwhile approach to formalising knowledge of coastal processes but which will be considerably extended in the course of the iCoast research. The process of developing behavioural geomorphic models will yield new insights into the controls upon coastal change and the ways in which coasts may be modified by changed environmental forcings. The coastal area modelling will yield new insights into the complex processes of sea bed sediment transport. 
Of most practical benefit will be the new predictive tools that are developed in the iCoast project. These will take a number of different forms, including coastal area models, data-based methods and behavioural geomorphic models. They will all be developed with a focus upon predicting the variables of most relevance to coastal managers, along with well justified uncertainty estimates. The application of the tools from iCOAST will directly contribute to future revisions of the Environment Agency's Long-Term Investment Strategy and the UK Government's strategic goals with respect to the adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change. It will also help with other needs such as the Water Framework Directive and other legislation.
There is a realistic prospect that innovations in the iCoast project will be rapidly taken up in practice. There is an urgent need for better predictive models to analyse coastal risks and justify coastal adaptation strategies. Strong links with the practitioner community and well developed knowledge transfer mechanisms mean that outputs can be transferred into practice as soon as they are demonstrated and validated. These innovations need not wait till the end of the project to be taken up in practice. 
The iCoast project will contribute to the development of a range of research and professional skills in the research team and amongst the project stakeholders with whom we interact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>380116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>East Anglian Coastal Group meeting, Norwich, march 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>417842D2-7C50-42FA-AF62-3B8AF90030BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stakeholder meeting</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddaf95184012.36186563</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participatory modelling workshop with Suffolk stakeholders, July 2015, Lowestoft</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>948CE09A-2F73-4C5F-9EB5-1407349402A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Very useful discussion of modelling approaches being developed and their potential application in Suffolk regional validation study.

The meeting was moderately successful in initiating a dialogue with the regional stakeholders, although a clash of dates with the Suffolk Coastal Forum meeting meant that some key stakeholders were missed.

The words used about our coastal environment are frequently negative: vulnerability, erosion, setbacks, retreat; they articulate a sense of loss, the belief that how it is or was very recently is how it should always be - and that this is under real or potential threat.

But another word is far more appropriate, and potentially far more enabling for the future of our coasts, just as it is for their past and present: dynamic. Just like our landscape more generally, coasts have never been static, and while today's reality may be attractive, particularly from a very local perspective, it really does no justice to the true story of the past; neither does it help realise potential for and future.

The process is amplified by one of the key spectres of our time: sea-level rise. Nobody could exaggerate its importance in the medium to long term. But it should not be allowed to dominate our thinking about processes that have been shaping our shores for hundreds of years. Sea level, like the landscape, is also dynamic, and in some areas, sea-level rise is a predominantly natural process. 

This subject is a very live one, with a number of dimensions: the politics of the coast are every bit as lively as those of flooding; and the future of the coastline is the subject of intense study, from a number of perspectives, with a major goal being a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability, resilience and capacity. 

This workshop is intended to start the process of bringing a different voice and perspective into that exploration. How might artistic sensibility contribute to this complex and emotionally charged subject? We don't know the answers, but the intention is to try to suggest some. 

The workshop will include presentations by Professors Nick Clifford and Mark Pelling from King's London, and Jon French of UCL. They will outline their work, including novel and technical coastal assessment approaches, and set out the current state of play - in research, coastal politics and more generally relating to changing paradigms of environmental change and uncertainty.

The CCO is the national repository for coastal data in England and is the main source of information for coastal engineering and management, including coastal morphodynamic data. Hence it is an effective dissemination partner. The CCO has been an embedded stakeholder from the beginning of the project. Information about iCOASST and the models has been made available on the iCOASST portal for download and use. In addition, input and output data files are in the process of being added, to allow users to identify the type and format of data required. This will allow new users to replicate the work of the iCOASST modellers. To further encourage effective dissemination, the models developed are being licenced under the General Public Licence, which promotes open access. The data files are being made available using the Open Government Licence. This dissemination route was planned from the beginning of the project and was included in our proposal.

The Environment Agency (EA) are funding an additional programme of work, led by HR Wallingford, over the next year to further the uptake of iCOASST results. The outputs include an end-user manual on the iCOASST methods and the wider issue of predicting decadal and centennial geomorphic evolution of our coasts and estuaries. There will also be a demonstration case study linking the iCOASST models to a flood risk analysis which will show how these tools can inform strategic flood risk assessment. All these results will also be added to the CCO web site.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DF6962A2-2601-4620-89A8-C0921C7966D7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dabb7abce5e5.47947403</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The iCOASST Project has demonstrated that improved decadal to centennial coastal geomorphic simulations are possible using new and improved models, both in isolation and in combination. This has been achieved by linking a range of components within a new conceptual framework comprising (1) a new Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping (CESM) method, which formalises our understanding the geomorphic system components and their relationships and integrates open coast and estuary within a unifying framework; (2) coastal area models of the shallow seabed, used to qualify and quantify sediment fluxes and exchanges with the coast at broad spatial scales; (3) landform behavioural models to quantitatively predict coastal and estuarine morphological change over decadal to centennial timescales; and (4) model coupling at run time using an external interface, OpenMI. UCL have developed the CESM component, including software to allow it to be applied by others. An initial beta release of the CESMapper software - a python plugin for the QGIS open-source GIS package - was released in July 2016 via the GitHub repository. UCL has also developed the mesoscale estuary modelling component in the form of the Estuary Spatial Morphological Change Model (ESTEEM). Concepts and algorithms were developed within the project itself and these are being converted to open source Fortran code that is being made freely available via GitHub.

CESM has been especially important as a basis for a more participatory modelling approach to the alignment of science and stakeholder perceptions of coastal morphological change. We have used this to formalise and align both scientific and stakeholder knowledge and perceptions of management problems. Insights gained from stakeholders has led directly to changes in how we approached the problem, and we were able to feed these insights into our model development process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work is being taken forward in two ways. A dedicated web site on the Channel Coastal Observatory went live in July 2016). This has archived all the results and the open source models for download. In addition, the Environment Agency have funded an additional piece of work over the next year to write a manual on the iCOASST methods and the wider issue of predicting decadal and centennial geomorphic evolution. There will also be a demonstration case study from the iCOASST models to a flood risk analysis which will show how these tools can inform strategic flood risk assessment. All Environment Agency results will be added to the CCO web site. Beyond these planned activities, the CESM approach could be applied to the entire coast of England and Wales and more widely as with small modifications, the approach is transferable globally. The development the ESTEEM model will continue very actively beyond the life of the project and we hope that this will become a widely used tool for simulation of mesoscale estuary morphological change.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E966940D-C5F0-4486-9ECB-1DB648A80624</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dabaa0cc0a16.53645706</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.channelcoast.org/icoasst</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>ESTEEM (Estuary SpaTial landscapE Evolution Model). ESTEEM is primarily raster-based and is designed to take advantage of lidar-based digital elevation models (DEMs); spatial resolution can be has high as 5m and the model is designed to resolve morphological change at a tide-averaged scale with a typical output timestep of 1 yr. The DEM is processed to identify discrete landform objects (subtidal channel, tidal flat, saltmarsh etc.), which are then simulated appropriately via one of the approaches highlighted above.
A key aspect of the model architecture is the use of a composite internal data model that embeds vector 1D representation of tidal channel networks and engineering structures in the bathymetric and topographic DEM raster. Flood and coastal defence structures can be modelled with realistic 'fragility curves' and their constraint on the morphological evolution of the major landform types can be explicitly simulated. ESTEEM is being developed under an open source licence (GPL) as a community model that incorporates compatibility with the OpenMI external coupling standard. This makes it suitable for deployment in conjunction with similarly OpenMI-compliant open coast model codes to simulate coupled estuary-coast morphological change at regional scales. However, it is also well-suited to standalone simulation of specific estuaries.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3AD3EC78-E368-417E-8FAC-A75CB01DD33D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet, but the source code for a beta version is soon to be made available via the Channel Coast Observatory (CCO; www.channelcoast.org) on a GPL arrangement.
