release of very large bodies of digital broadcast archives in parallel with the generation of new tools that allow richer use of media on the web. These developments will have consequences for any field of contemporary history, but are of particular significance for the environmental field. Framings of environmental change issues have typically been narrow and static, and have reinforced a policy field around these issues often unable to address the complexity and uncertainty of long term questions. Archive and web developments could combine to allow for more imaginative future responses to environmental change issues. However without a self-critical and open consideration of the 'digital ideologies' embedded in the tools and practices that mediating institutions develop for users' work with these enormous bodies of cultural content, there is a danger that the narrow and unproductive repertoire of environmental framings that is currently dominant will become further reinforced. This proposal responds directly to this urgent challenge. 

The project focuses on the archive of environmental programming collected by the BBC since the mid 1950s. Using a sample of programmes drawn from the archive it will critically examine their potential as resource for the making and debating of environmental histories in the context of imagining and planning for environmental futures. It builds on principles of co-production and social learning, and aims to support more plural and dynamic accounts of environmental change. 

Informed by a pilot study, which selected annotated and cleared limited use rights for approaching 100 programmes, amounting to 50 hours of programming, this study addresses the following question: How can digital broadcast archives inform environmental history and support public understanding of environmental change? This is broken down into four sub-questions:
1. In what ways does engagement with digital broadcast archives serve to revise and pluralise accounts of environmental history and politics?
2. What uses and expectations do publics have of digital broadcast archives, and how will they impact upon the way they engage with and act on environmental change issues?
3. What technical and cultural challenges and opportunities are presented to institutions that will be expected to have responsibility for, or will work with, online environmental digital archives (schools; universities; museums; media organisations)?
4. How can deeper knowledge of the production of past and present environmental understandings support more plural and dynamic imaginings of environmental futures?

These research questions will be explored by means of three overlapping pieces of work. Firstly, a history of broadcast media and environmental change, drawing on the broadcasts, interviews with makers and presenters, and working with scripts, paper archives and sources. Secondly, a series of focus groups with a sample group in order to explore the practices and expectations of archive users; and thirdly, a series of working group meetings and interviews with professionals and institutional representatives working with digital broadcast archives.

A series of outputs are designed to meet popular, policy and academic audience needs. A monograph, Earth in Vision, is offered as a media-rich and freely available e-book that revises contemporary environmental history with reference to the archive, and opens up a more plural and dynamic sense of possible environmental futures. It will include 25,000 words of linear text, but will also offer reader-chosen routes through the material, drawing on script content, programme descriptions, source materials and reviews. In addition to academic journal articles, a resource-rich public facing website, podcasts and a pop-up exhibition, we will draft a report for professional and policy audiences advising on digital broadcast archive planning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Earth in Vision aims to have positive impacts for: general publics; learners and teachers; industries working with digital media, and cultural institutions. The choice of advisory board has been strongly influenced by these objectives, and we will be supplementing it to further enhance impact if we are successful with the bid.

For the general public: 
We aim to show that historical resources, specifically digital broadcast archives of environmental programming, can open up the public and policy imagination about humanity's environmental futures. We will pursue this goal with a website of free and adaptable resources, a free, scholarly but engaging e-book with options for user-generated journeys through the content, and a pop-up exhibition (with supporting print materials) that will appear at cultural venues and events (e.g. Eden Project, Hay Festival, music festivals). Smith will apply his media contacts and experience to win general media attention for the project on e.g. magazine format radio and TV shows, and in features journalism.

For learners and teachers:
The website, e-book and print resources will support more dynamic engagement with environment, development and geographical education by allowing students and teachers to engage with the way that environmental understandings have been produced. Even in advance of the release of more substantial digital broadcast archives by media institutions these resources, including some clips, but also extensive scripts, reviews and samples of source content (key texts, images, science findings and events), will give learners and teachers more ownership of the making and remaking of environmental histories and futures. In designing these materials we will draw on the team's extensive experience of working in formal and informal distance learning for large-scale audiences. This includes our work on large population OU courses (e.g. 2000 students per year upwards) but also in generating materials for informal learning supporting major primetime BBC series such as Attenborough's climate change season (2006) and Coast with audiences of over 5 million.

For cultural institutions:
Digital broadcast archives present both opportunities and challenges to public service broadcasters, museums, libraries, archives and film/TV related bodies. We aim to support their medium and long term thinking through our work with our body of 'proxy publics'. By making intelligent use of the opportunities presented by the BBC and OU's exclusive agreement around archive usage we can overcome obstacles presented by restrictive rights regimes and gather unique insights into the practices and expectations of archive users. Our research design for this aspect of the project is based on a co-production model suited to emerging relationships between cultural institutions and users. The primary paths to impact are the two workshops and end of project conference, the concise industry-focused report and some targeted media work with trade/sectoral media.

For industries working with digital media:
The first speech by the BBC's new Director General George Entwistle confirmed the ways in which media production is moving towards more integrated generation of content across platforms. Archive content has long been important in TV production, but the prospect of its wider release, in the context of easy public access to digital media production and publication tools, and the rising prominence of social media, make for a heady and novel mix. The workshops, end of project conference and industry focused report will all nourish debates at this intersection.

The purpose was to introduce our project and explore with them how they might use digital broadcast archives (DBAs), and to pathfind thier 'user' expectations as digital citizens around uses and tools they would want form such DBAs. Both sessions sparked questions and interest around just seeing the kind of content available form the BBC archives, and about access in terms of digital availability and rights issues around re-use and reversioning broadcast and written materials. Two students asked to join the Earth in Vision project on work placements (80 hours each). We accepted their applications, and they have each been working on a variety of tasks, form reseraching in the written archives to making edits of our film clips and interview films, ebook production work and filmijng interviews. the collaboration has been very successful.

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and at the same time a story that the mainstream media seem to have little appetite for. What is going wrong, and who is responsible? Joe will draw on twenty years of experience of research but also practical projects at the join between media decision-making and environmental research and policy to sketch out some answers. He will explore the roles of media organisations, environmental NGOs, the research and policy communities and audiences/citizens/publics (us!) in constructing climate change as a 'difficult story'. Joe will also test and invite ideas about how we can all play a part in devising new storylines - above all some hopeful ones.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c52a125c3f64.86311907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cugs.co.uk/events/2017-02-02-joe-smith---climate-change-in-the-media%3A-the-greatest-story-never-told%3F</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Workshops - The Northern Ireland Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4DD63D28-ED56-4D64-83A3-AAFBDA0AEE63</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Earth in Vision team were invited by the Belfast Open University regional Centre to return to Belfast to give the two workshops we had given in 2014, this time for the Science Festival which has recently included nature and environment in their programme. the workhops - titled My Life with Attenborough and Change the World! - were open to all ages and were well attended by both adults and children. Places available were 15 per workshop and we were fully booked (so 60 people). people really engaged with the materials and tasks, with children and adults making voice over climate change clips and making theior own nature documentaries on endangered vs successful species (which they could keep as we sent digital copies to them). One mother emailed me to tell me that her 8 year old boy, a dedicated Attenboruogh fan - had decalred 'I will never forget this day, it was the best day ever'. One young film maker asked if she could be involved in the project on a placement, and we are in the process of responding to this by developing a piece of fim work she could do.

I also recorded interviews with trainee journalists and trainers which will appear in due course on the Creative Climate website which is also holding our main body of Earth in Vision interviews.

My script was informed by my close knowledge of BBC treatment of climate change across three decades, drawing on the AHRC funded Earth in Vision project.

They represent the channels target demographic, and were able to talk about their own journey with energy and climate change issues, and own experience of producing their own media on the topic, due to their involvement in the project. The meeting was designed to help BBC Three consider commissions on the topic and encourage independent producers to develop ideas to pitch. But it was also designed to give the experts present - including people from architecture, fashion, and energy fields, UK and international - greater insights into media decision making.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ce333a55f5f3.62119653</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Climate Change on Television: What the Paris Agreement means for broadcasters</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>885D71A8-DCF3-481D-9A29-830FEE208F2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar for television executives was attended by representatives from all major UK broadcasters (several of them with global reach).
