Failure to recruit adequate numbers of participants can lead to equivocal results or premature termination of the trial. Attrition, whereby patients are lost to follow-up (e.g. cannot be contacted, refuse to participate further), can seriously compromise the validity of RCT findings.

A body of literature exists regarding what factors influence recruitment to RCTs, and also which strategies may be effective in improving recruitment. However there remains a need for identifying solutions employed in current RCTs and systematic evaluation of effective strategies to improve recruitment. More recent technological innovations such as web based recruitment and mobile technology have the potential to effect both recruitment and attrition. Attrition from RCTs has received less attention. The reasons for attrition in cohort studies and RCTs may differ. For example, randomisation may result in participants being allocated to an arm of the trial that they did not want to be in.

The purpose of the cross unit appointment would be to:
1) Conduct a systematic review of effective interventions to reduce attrition within RCTs
2) Update the current systematic review on effective recruitment strategies from 2005-2008
3) Interview trialists about their views on successful strategies to improve recruitment and reduce attrition in RCTs
4) Identify through the MRC units if there are data on recruitment strategies in RCTs and reduction of attrition, in recently completed trials, which have not been analysed or published
5) Organise a national workshop at the end of 24 months to disseminate findings and agree strategies to further develop the research in this field</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24617</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66ADD6B3-AA1C-4162-A37A-280328F39F1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying additional studies for a systematic review of retention strategies in randomised controlled trials: making contact with trials units and trial methodologists.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Systematic reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/be104b9f859b1182f6dcc12403f7d6ec"><gtr:id>be104b9f859b1182f6dcc12403f7d6ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brueton V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2046-4053</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8c657ed1f3c8.46786319</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>539EF7E4-2BE9-47A6-A9A4-DB1714BCEDFD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Best practice guidance for the use of strategies to improve retention in&amp;nbsp;randomized trials developed from two consensus workshops.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of clinical epidemiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/be104b9f859b1182f6dcc12403f7d6ec"><gtr:id>be104b9f859b1182f6dcc12403f7d6ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brueton V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0895-4356</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8c651f781561.73274271</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U122792695</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>90487A08-C473-4CEB-B6D9-011A74AD06CF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.4  Research design and methodologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
