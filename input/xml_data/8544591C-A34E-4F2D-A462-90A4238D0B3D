This will be the first book to explore comparatively German photographic art, in the context of the Cold War and in relation to modernism and postmodernism. It is widely recognised that the modernist German visual culture which emerged in the first part of the twentieth century was defined - from Dada, to the Bauhaus and New Objectivity - by its having embraced the photographic medium. With National Socialism and the Second World War, such avant-garde investigations were violently curtailed, and the impact of the Cold War on Germany further fractured this modernist legacy. How and why photography once more emerged as an artistic medium of central importance in both Germanies in the postwar period is yet to be satisfactorily examined, and is the subject of this study. This book is based on the premise that, despite the division of the Cold War, it is possible to define a documentary photographic paradigm with similar characteristics in both East and West Germany, extending from the immediate post-war period up to 1989, for which the legacy of New Objectivity, and the work of the modernist photographers associated with it - August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch - was particularly important. New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) heralded a new way of seeing explicitly associated with the mechanised view of the camera. But 'Sachlichkeit' meant more than just objectivity; it connoted a certain materiality, an 'object-ness', which resided in the power of things. This eulogy to objectivity was echoed in wider Weimar cultural and intellectual currents, and was based upon a critique of the subject which was itself in part a product of the perception of the failure of Expressionism. Yet, ultimately, New Objectivity failed, and was criticised by the Left for its reactionary tendencies and aestheticisation of politics. Its more radical proponents, however, were praised, and this book will argue that it left one valuable legacy: the search for a proper politics of the object. \n\nThe book will contend that from the 1950s up until the end of the 1980s, photographers such as Bernd and Hilla Becher, Michael Schmidt, Evelyn Richter and Rudolph Sch&amp;auml;fer returned to this difficult modernist inheritance, as well as to a critical re-evaluation of photography's objectivity and realism, in order to explore issues of German identity and the role of artistic authorship. This return to the tradition of New Objectivity - which has not been fully examined in the West, and has been entirely neglected in the East - was, I argue, the consequence of institutional continuities combined with complex historical experience. Pursuing a photography which attempted to de-psychologise both the photographer and his or her subject, such postwar photographers favoured the difficult objectivity of the camera above the 'voice' of the individual artist. Unlike that of their modernist precursors, it will be argued that the work of these practitioners actively engages in an implicit critique of the traditional functions of photography, embracing seriality and a more self-reflexive, 'postmodern' sensibility that critiqued photography's representational functions and idealised vision. The characteristics of the postwar photographic practices explored will be shown to have originated in a concern with the 'objectivity' and 'materiality' of photography, and a privileging of realism and the objects under the camera's lens. Crucially, in approaching the question of photographic objectivity, this study will not attempt to cast it as an abstract universal category, but rather as a perilously fragile and impossible artistic ideal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the first comprehensive English-language study of postwar German photography, the book will be an invaluable resource for the British curatorial community, and particularly those specialists working in photographic institutions and organisations. It is to be hoped that it will help foster new exhibitions on neglected postwar German practitioners upon whom there are presently very limited available sources. \n\nEast German photography - as with much art from the former Eastern Bloc - suffered immensely when forced to adapt to the private art market of the West, and has since been unfairly neglected by the West's cultural industries. Many of the East German practitioners upon whom my study focuses have not yet enjoyed the recognition that their life's work deserves. It is hoped that the exposure and legitimacy granted by this nuanced exploration of their work will be of benefit to these specific individuals, and those small public and private organisations (such as the photo-agency Ostkreuz, and galleries including Galerie Oben, Chemnitz) representing such artists.\n\nAt present there exists a surprisingly large gulf between Germanic and Anglo-American cultural industries. One of the central impacts of the project is, therefore, to open up dialogue between German and Anglo-American economies of knowledge, promoting greater intellectual, cultural, social and economic exchange. As a life-long alumnus of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, my research is very much committed to facilitating transnational exchange. Such exchanges will be of immense benefit not only to the academic community, but also to the creative and cultural industries, museums and galleries. Having gained first-hand experience as a consultant on the highly successful exhibition 'Do Not Refreeze: Photography Behind the Berlin Wall', organised by Matthew Shaul in 2007, I am presently in talks with several museums and galleries in the UK and Germany regarding the possibility of organising a touring exhibition on East and West German photography after the completion of this fellowship. It is hoped that the professional relationships and new networks formed between German and British curators and researchers during such an endeavour could in turn lead to further projects, with the objective of enhancing public debates on the relationship between photography and the formation of identity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001255/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
