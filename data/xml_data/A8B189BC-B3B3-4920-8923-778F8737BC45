Based on primary sources, it examines the strong links between agricultural and land reform politics, and contemporary ideas of national identity.

Published in the prestigious Royal Historical Society 'studies in history' series, this book was completed with the assistance of a term's worth of AHRC-funded leave in 2005-6. It is probably my most significant piece of research to date. Its significance lies in the fact that it offers the first book-length study of the relationship between Englishness and the politics of land - a relationship that has remained remarkably understudied despite the nationalistic resonance of the rural in modern English culture ('England is the country, and the country is England', as Stanley Baldwin famously remarked). Drawing on a broad range of material, from short stories by Rudyard Kipling to parliamentary debates, this book provides a sustained examination of the ideas that informed cultural debate on issues relating to the land, from paternalist 'pure squire Conservatism' to patriotic radical visions of a happy pre-enclosure England. It makes clear, as historians have yet to recognize, that the English land question excited interest, passion and controversy because it addressed contested issues of patriotism and national identity. The book has been favourably reviewed in leading academic journals. Among other accolades, it has been described as 'important and innovative' (Twentieth Century British History), an 'impressive addition to the output of a prolific historian' (Rural History), and the 'important' work of 'a gifted historian' that 'deserves to be widely read' (Parliamentary History). A reviewer in the journal 'History' declared it was 'destined to be the standard work for many years to come'</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>May be of use in informing policy, esp land use policy, in Britain: cf. work of &amp;quot;History and Policy&amp;quot; network of historians, especially the &amp;quot;environment&amp;quot; forums hosted by H&amp;amp;P, and in which the grant-holder has participated



The book may be of some interest to general readers, given its cheap paperback price (&amp;pound;17)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DE983B67-17A2-4048-8A97-7723B0161896</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-687221754.98234277766c99a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4166881D-D60E-4E17-A197-04D3772D81F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Land and Nation in England: Patriotism, National Identity, and the Politics of Land, 1880-1914</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/83e1391951620d57db12dec9b03cf640"><gtr:id>83e1391951620d57db12dec9b03cf640</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Readman Paul</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780861932979</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_67941197753bf332a8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">113016/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
