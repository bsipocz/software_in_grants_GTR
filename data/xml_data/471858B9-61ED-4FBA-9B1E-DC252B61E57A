The Culture of the Market Network will bring together an international group of intellectual and cultural historians on the one hand and business and economic historians on the other to investigate the particular forms of epistemology, subjectivity and social relations that were created by and that in turn help reconfigure financial capitalism in the long nineteenth century in the United States. A series of four symposia (one in Manchester, one in Harvard, and two via videoconference) will focus on the intersections between culture and economics in nineteenth-century America, a period that offers many insightful parallels to the current moment of crisis in global financial capitalism. The Network will be interdisciplinary and comparative in outlook, promoting interaction between the core group of researchers and invited experts from related fields such as Victorian Britain and present-day Wall Street.\n\nThe Network will investigate how non-experts learned to make sense of financial information in general and the operations of the stock market in particular in the period. It will do so by focussing on the forms of financial knowledge that they acquired, and the ideological assumptions behind the turn to statistics and forecasting as ways of representing the market. The Network will consider the institutional, rhetorical and psychological mechanisms that helped persuade ordinary people to participate in the stock market, and the role of seemingly non-economic factors such as trust and confidence in shaping market behaviour in the period. It will also showcase research on how global commodity chains helped forge a popular understanding - and distrust - of a globalised market. Finally the Network will explore how popular scepticism about the market and money played out in the political struggles of the era. The research findings of the network will be promoted through a project website that include a blog and a podcast of the proceedings, conference panels, the publication of an edited collection, and journal articles and newspaper journalism.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Show Me the Money: The Image of Finance, 1700 to the Present&amp;quot; is a touring exhibition at Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art (Sunderland), Chawton House Library (Alton), John Hansard Gallery (Southampton) and People's History Museum (Manchester).</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B5D42EC-25D9-4D69-886F-5D8DEFD0333E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public visitor numbers increased at Chawton House and John Hansard Gallery.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546b1118131752.00206848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Show Me the Money</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.imageoffinance.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Show Me the Money Exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA670558-64D7-44BE-AF84-64379158C72F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview on BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking, and profile of the project on BBC News website (Your Money section)

It stimulated public debate about how high finance has become such a powerful and yet little understood force. It was seen in four different locations over the period of two and half years and received national and local extensive press coverage in each. During this time the exhibition hosted seven public events. It also hosted over 30 educational events - workshops, guided tours, practice-based sessions - of all kinds and to all ages (from primary schools, to prisons, to universities, to life long learning, to finance professionals). It commissioned a newly design and original 'app' that allowed children to remotely access the ideas and histories that the exhibition contained. The text and concepts from the exhibition were used by 'Rethink Economics' in their planning and delivery of the events that accompanied the Barbican's 'The Colour of Money' film season, and Nicky Marsh gave a talk at that event (September 2015). The work is also being used to inform national-level research. We were consulted to give evidence on the future of money to a Parliamentary Report, 'POSTnote on Alternative Currencies', that was published in August 2014. Key commissions from the exhibition are already being disseminated beyond it. One of the pieces of original work that was commissioned for the exhibition, Cornford and Cross' piece Black Narcissus is now being used as the front cover for the new The Oxford Handbook of Financial Regulation (Oxford University Press, 2015). This piece, which examines the fantasy languages of financial crisis, is now appearing on standard University textbook about regulation and this means it will be widely viewed by tomorrow's financial actors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5F0D9904-2445-44A9-A45D-16A0B8B487BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d33aa8e7e670.89498501</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imageoffinance.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>061B7D6A-F397-44E7-811D-5C3E4CDE8DB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Special issue on 'Fictions of Finance'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cultural Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/22d5196c3322ead0514e8dad3c8e18c3"><gtr:id>22d5196c3322ead0514e8dad3c8e18c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Knight, P.
