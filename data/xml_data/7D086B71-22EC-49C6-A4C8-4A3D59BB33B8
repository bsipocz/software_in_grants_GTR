Overall, this project will improve energy efficiency by involving building users in engaging and ongoing conversations prompting energy efficiency actions in building environments. By exploiting and co-opting existing technologies, and developing a user-centered design approach, it will deliver 'conversational tools' through which people and buildings can input and receive information about themselves and each other. The approaches, interventions and solutions will initially be informed by a detailed case study and trial deployment within an industrial site comprising of both factory and office environments. They will then be further developed into a generic solution, applicable across a wide range of non-domestic buildings. The developing action research methodology will then be transformed into a process toolkit which can be applied in a range of contexts through a consultancy model. Within this context, the contribution of the Bartlett School of Graduate Studies at UCL will be to develop a methodology to characterise and scope user-focused energy reduction interventions within industrial settings and office buildings. In particular, data on user-dependent energy consumption will be gathered in factory and office sites, via energy surveys, desk-based analysis and modelling. Focus groups and surveys of users of the same sites will also capture the users' values, drivers and perspectives on energy use and on energy saving behaviors. These surveys and focus groups will also be informed by a review of evidence on existing methods and tools for behavior engagement/change, with a particular focus on the field of occupational psychology. The data gathered will then be used to develop new methods for widely applicable user-focused energy saving strategies and to estimate their energy saving potential. The effectiveness (from the users' perspective) of such energy saving measures will be tested in the field by an observational study and a focus group aimed at gathering users' feedbacks on the strategies implemented within the context of the wider project. The feedbacks will then be incorporated into improved methods for strategy formulation, which will be broadly applicable to a variety of factory sites and office buildings.At present, there is very limited field-based data on user-controlled energy consumption, particularly for factory sites which often include several functions (workshop, office, etc.). Furthermore, most existing energy use studies on behavioral mechanisms and on strategies for behavior change focus on domestic settings and their results are not necessarily immediately applicable to non-domestic environments. UCL's contribution to this project will involve the methods of data gathering, strategy formulation and testing of effectiveness, which will then be aggregated to provide new knowledge on user-dependent energy use. This will provide essential evidence to unravel the complexities of user-dependent energy use and of behavior change within the context of non-domestic buildings, especially factory sites and office buildings. This evidence will underpin the formulation of effective user-centered strategies for energy-efficient design and building operation, which will be widely applicable to a range of factory sites and office buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21615</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Moixa Energy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Building Banter</gtr:description><gtr:id>6342920E-3D0C-4AF2-8EAC-2FA0BEB9E878</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9735e24b9735e38-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This EPSRC project is part of a larger TSB-funded project (still ongoing), involving several academic and industrial project partners.

Details of the financial contribution of each industrial partner can be obtained from TSB.

The project overall resulted in a new approach where energy use data is collected by specially developed sensors and fed into a live 3D computer model of the factory that staff can consult on their PCs, enabling them to pinpoint energy wastage. The sensors also trigger text messages reminding staff to turn off lights and equipment left on unnecessarily. The approach resulted in an estimated 20% energy saving over 6 months, and was featured as a news item on the EPSRC website (7 June 2013), which also includes a link to the project's YouTube video. 
The lead industry partner (Moixa) is now the main one taking the results of the overall project forward, through their commercial activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EA512F3D-414A-4B92-A97E-1C84720F6A25</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b9e5dc17e040.05459475</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Building users can play a significant role in buildings' energy consumption and hence a user-centered approach might contribute towards significant energy savings in buildings. Energy use in industrial settings can be significant, however there is limited field-based data on user-controlled energy consumption in factory sites, which can be very complex. Furthermore, most energy-use studies on behavioral mechanisms and behavior-change strategies focus on domestic environments: their results are not necessarily applicable to non-domestic settings. Overall, the Building Banter project aims to develop tools (in progress, reported elsewhere) to help drive energy use reductions in industrial and office environments through low cost re-deployable modules prompting behaviour change. A factory manufacturing products for the automotive and vehicles industry was used as a 'live laboratory' for the development and testing of the tools. Within this project, UCL's contribution aimed to provide much needed evidence on user-dependent energy saving opportunities as mediated by behavioral needs/barriers, within the context of factory sites and offices. 

Within the case study, analysis of existing energy data, energy surveys, focus groups and interviews with key players were carried out. The work was also supported by a review of evidence on behavioural mechanisms and behaviour-change strategies. The key findings and outputs were: a) In the case study, a relatively large proportion of electricity was being used for dust extraction and compression systems, as well as lighting - which became focus for interventions. The methodology developed for estimating baseline use in the case-study could be potentially applied to other similar complex factory settings; b) User-centered opportunities for energy saving were identified, particularly with regards to baseloads and switching off of equipment during down-times and weekends. Some of these strategies are also applicable to other factory environments; c) A novel questionnaire-based benchmarking tool was developed, for the assessment of behaviour change potential for energy saving in the workplace. Within the case study, the application of the questionnaire proved very valuable, as it allowed the identification of areas for improvement, particularly the need for better communication of energy policy and targets, as well as addressing feedback mechanisms for energy use; d) The case-study also provided an opportunity to pilot-test the benchmarking tool, for the purposes of its application to other settings. Analysis showed that the questionnaire's self-reported behaviour results partly contrasted with the findings from focus-groups and with management's perceptions. Hence, it was concluded that this section of the tool should not be the primary benchmarking variable, but represents users' notions on energy saving. It is anticipated that the tool will be used further, for research and consultancy, in collaboration with other Building Banter project partners. 



Overall, this project found that user-dependent energy-saving opportunities in factories are not only affected by technological barriers, but also by the interactions between individual users and the prevailing corporate culture at the site. This aspect is often overlooked in behavioural interventions. Hence, the benchmarking tool developed in this project should represent a valuable approach for the identification of potential areas for behaviour change in energy use within industrial environments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Whilst the novel questionnare tool developed in this study is mostly intended for expert users, it could be utilized in a consultancy mode, for example to advise manufacturing and/or office-based companies about their user-dependent energy-saving potential. In addition, the tool could be further developed and benchmarking data gathered, so that it could eventually be used by non-expert users (e.g. the companies themselves), for a baseline assessment of their user-dependent energy-saving potential and for the identification of areas for improvement. It is anticipated that the tool will be used not only as a research tool, but also as a consultancy opportunity for advising factories and office-based companies of their user-dependent energy-saving potential. One of the main outcomes of this project is the development and pilot-testing of a novel questionnaire-based tool for the assessment of behaviour-change potential for energy saving in factories and offices. The tool can be applied in intervention studies, for the identification of areas for improvement within an organisation (e.g. before and after an energy saving campaign). Potentially, the tool could also be used for benchmarking against the performance of similar organisations - provided that sufficient benchmarking data has been collected. Hence the questionnaire could be a useful tool for the assessment of intervention studies on energy saving in factories and offices, not only for research purposes (e.g. evaluation of innovative research strategies) but also for initiatives within commercial organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>11D962E8-E62E-4401-9F32-B9FB9CB1349A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1904886217.699280377598d2a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.moixaenergy.com/energy.asp</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>One of the main outcomes of this project is the development and pilot-testing of a questionnaire-based tool for the assessment of behaviour-change potential for energy saving in factories and offices.
