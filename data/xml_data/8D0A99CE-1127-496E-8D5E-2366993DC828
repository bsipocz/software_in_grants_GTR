Entertainment Experiences</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/F066910/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>From games, to museums, to theme parks, to television, the creativeindustries are increasingly focused on the need for personalisation. Peopleare no longer willing to be passive consumers of experiences, but ratherexpect to be able to interact, explore, participate, shape, share anddiscuss them, and also to tailor and personalise them to suit theirindividual preferences. But how do we learn about people's preferences? This proposal aims toexplore the feasibility of using wearable biosensing technologies to capturedetailed physiological responses from participants such as heart rate andgalvanic skin response (GSR) which, along with movement data and video andaudio recordings, might be used to personalise different aspects of anexperience from its design, to its operation, to the way in which it isdocumented and shared with others. We will take the themepark as a driving domain for exploring the role ofbiosensing in designing, documenting and adapting entertainment experiences.Specifically, we will collaborate with Alton Towers, the UK's best knownthemepark, to conduct a series of three short feasibility studies in orderto frame issues and questions for further in depth research. The first willcapture a variety of biosensing data from different riders across differentrides and will conduct a preliminary analysis of this with a view ofinforming discussions of how such data might potentially help in theanalysis of existing rides and the design of future ones. The second willexplore how such data might be combined with captured video and audio aspart of the automated documentation and remote sharing of experiences. Thethird will consider the potential of biosensing to create new rides thatdirectly adapt themselves to a rider's personal response, includingexploring the feasibility of future robotic rides to adapt in real-time,i.e. during the ride experience. This feasibility study will build on preliminary work that has established abaseline of robust wearable biosensing technology and a successful workingrelationship with Alton Towers. Thus this proposal is not about thetechnical feasibility of constructing wearable biosensing technologies or ofbeing able to experiment with these in a theme park - these have alreadybeen proven. Rather, it is about the feasibility of using the resultingbiosensing data to enhance entertainment experiences in different ways,initially in theme parks, but ultimately across the creative industries andthe wider Digital Economy. The proposal also involves collaboration with RoboCoaster, a world-leadingleading company in the research, development, and production of automatedrides and entertainment experiences based on industrial robots andconveyance systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87891</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BBC</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8CFD053-AAD7-4B66-91D5-C6E781F9FBF3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9cd6cc0b9cd6cd4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Waddell Media Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Waddell Media</gtr:description><gtr:id>F680FE49-3CF8-4F01-88C3-BA8D7337CC21</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9cd7fd0b9cd7fe4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>RoboCoaster</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Robocoaster Limited</gtr:description><gtr:id>F18695AA-7F9E-4465-8D2B-2A166CF63C8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9cce520b9cce534-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Alton Towers Resort</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Alton Towers Resort</gtr:description><gtr:id>24C10254-CAEE-42BF-BAB5-90C43652CF1F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9cde358b9cde36c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of this Digital Economy feasibility fed into the formation of the Horizon Digital Economy Hub hosted at Nottingham, including the involvement of our partner Merlin Entertainment. The initial work carried out with Alton Towers here led to further engagements at Thorpe Park as well as with TV companies, BBC, Discovery Channel and RDF as noted below.

This research into thrill technologies has underpiined three key forms of impact: 
o Public engagement through staging events and associated media coverage
o Television companies commissioning us to use our technologies to make programs
o Entertainment and marketing companies commissioning us to support campaigns

Public engagement
A key impact of this research lies in its extensive public engagement, communicating ideas around the potential use of biosensing in the creative industries and raising the profile of the Digital Economy research. Our 'in the wild' approach to research has involved our research team staging a series of high-profile public events that have directly engaged thousands of participants, while indirectly reaching millions more through associated media coverage:

o Our Oblivion: Thrill Laboratory public event at Alton Towers Resort in 2007 directly involved hundreds of public participants and reached many more through coverage on both BBC and ITV news and in the Daily Mirror and Nottingham Evening Post.
o We exhibited an early version of our Broncomatic ride at EPSRC's Pioneers 09 Exhibition at Olympia in March 2009, featuring in EPSRC's media coverage. 
o The final version of the Broncomatic featured in the cover article of the January 2010 edition of The Times Eureka science supplement
o We staged two performances called Self Examination and Hyperventilation in which we broadcast viewer's reactions to watching horror films, reported in a Guardian Science podcast, by BBC East Midlands Today, and the Nottingham Evening Post.
o We created the Per Ping breath-controlled tennis game for exhibition at the Cheltenham Science Festival in May 2011.
o We staged a performance called The Experiment Live at the Mayhem horror film festival in October 2012 in which we use biodata to create an unusual narrative around a s?ance held in a nearby cellar.
o Our research was also covered in the New Scientist magazine and subsequently on their blog in May 2011
As further evidence for the wider cultural impact of this work, the Broncomatic was nominated for a 2010 international digital arts award at the 2010 Future Everything festival.

Use to create TV programmes
The initial media interest in our research ultimately led to direct commercial engagement with television companies in we employed our know-how and technology to enable them to produce articles for mainstream television programmes. Examples include:
o Creating an extended feature in the Discovery Channel programme Engineering Thrills that was first broadcast in October 2008 
o An article that ran across two episodes of the BBC 1 Blue Peter flagship children's show in March 2009 in which presenters 'tested' rollercoasters.
o An article on The One Show in which presenter Christopher Biggins (no less!) experienced a vertical drop rollercoaster that aired in October 2009
o A feature article on the BBC popular science programme Bang Goes The Theory that also aired in 2009.
In each case, our team of researchers was commissioned as consultants to use our technologies to capture experiences and to then help visualise the results on screen (and sometimes appear in the programmes). This commercial impact directly led to the Horizon-funded Vicarious project which is now working with television production companies to explore the creative potential of personal biodata to support new TV formats. 

Use in marketing campaigns
The coverage and uptake of our services by television companies led to further strand of commercial activity in terms of working for entertainment and marketing companies to support major marketing campaigns::
o Merlin Entertainment and Lionsgate films used our system to compare the experience of watching the film Saw VII, with the Saw ride and the Saw horror maze as part of their marketing of the new Saw ride at the Thorpe Park amusement park. 
o The London Dungeon (also owned by the Merlin group) used our technology and know-how as part of a similar marketing activity for a major new ride.
o Finally, we have recently been commissioned by marketing company TWBA to support a major nationwide marketing campaign for the new Nissan Juke that features a series of explorations of people engaging in students and extreme sports activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>507947D4-0129-428D-94FE-06D48BC97E95</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545d05571a70d0.66231194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered new approaches to the co-creation of souvenirs in which groups of visitors to a theme park, along with the park itself, all contribute photos of ride experiences and then select, annotate and compose these so as to create personalised photo stories. This work led to a best paper (top 1% of all submissions) at the prestigious CHI 2011 conference.

We also discovered how to use wearable biosensing technologies such as heart-rate monitors, GSR (sweat) sensors and others to create thrilling interactive rides. This informed subsequent work on designing deliberately uncomfortable interactions so as to create enlightening, entertaining and socially bounding experiences. This work led to a best paper (top 1% of all submissions) at the prestigious CHI 2012 conference.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings can inform future souvenir systems and interactive rides as well as general approaches to designing thrilling entertainment experiences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D3BF5620-99F4-4C42-B4EC-75805D01C514</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d069d816ce2.72382217</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4635265F-C5AD-4257-A5B5-07B55EB438DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging Research and Performance Through Pervasive and Locative Arts Projects</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1a70783c68bb2205dc30772fafd8c00"><gtr:id>e1a70783c68bb2205dc30772fafd8c00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S Benford</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_277386071914044660</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>38F56F8C-6291-4AAE-BEB4-2ADFACB73729</gtr:id><gtr:title>From Interaction to Trajectories</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1a70783c68bb2205dc30772fafd8c00"><gtr:id>e1a70783c68bb2205dc30772fafd8c00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S Benford</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_663293761314044700</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F066910/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
