As the global financial markets are clearly a major component of the current and future digital economy landscape both in the UK and overseas, such a showcase seems ideally-suited to funding from EPSRC's Digital Economy programme. TradeTech2010 will be held in the UK for the first time in its ten-year history, adding extra significance to a showcase of EPSRC-funded researchers and research-outputs. The cash value of in-kind contributions from WBR, the conference company that organizes the TradeTech summit series, is worth up to 37,400 and hence significantly exceeds the EPSRC funding requested here. The two authors of this proposal have a unique mix of experience, expertise, and contacts that make them ideally suited to deliver a high value return on the modest funds requested here.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By the usual standards of EPSRC grant applications, the amount of money requested here is quite small. Nevertheless, we believe that the degree of impact per pound spent will be very high (although of course it is famously difficult to precisely define what we mean by degree of impact , given the intangibility of some significant and desirable forms of impact). Specific knowledge-transfer, of particular ideas and practices, will occur in the keynote presentations, and in the rising-star sessions, in the sense that ideas currently being developed in academic research contexts will be exposed to an audience of senior, hardened, industry practitioners. The flow of knowledge will not be one-way though: the responses of the expert panellists to each of the rising-star presentations will allow the academics present to refine their understanding of what kind of research work is judged to be useful by industry practitioners, and what kind of research is not. More diffuse knowledge-transfer and impact will manifest themselves in the increased awareness among the TradeTech2010 delegates of the role of EPSRC in general, and the Digital Economy programme in particular, in funding advanced R&amp;amp;D activities in UK universities that is likely to be of relevance and interest to industrial practitioners in the global financial markets. This may then in turn result in an increase in collaborative financial industry/academia grant-proposal submissions, or of other forms of financial-markets industrial participation in EPSRC's various funding activities. The development and publication of the designs for the lab-in-a-box experimental trading floor is intended to have an impact on the world community of researchers, academic or industrial, who have hitherto been prevented from conducting trading-floor experiments by the belief that they are only possible in expensively-equipped fixed laboratory installations. We fully expect that our methods will be copied, and adapted and extended, by researchers around the world, although it is of course not possible at this stage to predict which researchers will pick up on our work, nor how they will use it or extend it. Nevertheless, we feel optimistic that, if funded, our work as proposed here will lead to a noticeable increase in the use of rigorous laboratory experiments as a testing ground for new ideas in trading systems and market mechanisms. The impact of releasing the lab-in-a-box as open-source can be measured by citation counts after two or three years have elapsed (this being the lead-time from someone downloading our la-in-a-box, running their own experiments, and then having the results of those experiments published in peer-review outlets).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14488</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This grant enabled the purchase of computing and network equipment, and the development of software to run on the computers, that could be used to study the interaction of human traders with automated trading systems, under controlled experimental conditions.
