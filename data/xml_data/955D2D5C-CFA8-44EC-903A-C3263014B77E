It is not possible to complete the swim successfully without rigorous training, often over several years; it is a body project which requires the purposeful development of a wide range of embodied techniques, knowledges and practices, including efficient stroke technique, endurance, acclimatisation to cold water, in-water nutrition and psychological strategies for coping with the sensory deprivations and physical discomforts of marathon swimming.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Drawing on auto-ethnographic data on the researcher's own training, and the ethnographic study of the community and wider context within which training takes place, this research aims to explore the development of the techniques, knowledges and practices necessary to the process of becoming a Channel swimmer; the body pedagogics involved in the acquisition, embodiment and transfer of those techniques; and the identity production at work in those processes. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This out-of-the-ordinary body project offers a novel perspective from which to interrogate contemporary thinking and policy in relation to sport and physical activity, and the counter-normative aspects of the training process (for example, the purposeful acquisition and maintenance of body fat) provide an opportunity to think differently, and potentially more inclusively, about what constitutes a sporting body in contemporary society. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;We cannot let up until our sport is purified&quot;: marathon swimming and the troubled boundaries of authenticity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>928346E7-D4C7-4740-8C9B-2912C404B800</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This paper was given as part of a seminar series run by the School of Applied Sciences at Durham University on 9 May, 2013.

The event was held in Bath on 5-6 May, 2011, and was on the theme: Researching Fat Studies and HAES: Working with / as fat bodies. This was one of the first talks I gave on the research, and was a first attempt at writing about the issue of swimming fat. The paper argued that some of the very negative talk about fat (and gender and sexuality) that I encountered whilst doing the research created a dilemma for me both as a researcher, and as as a feminist and as a fat woman.

After the talk I was contacted by several audience members asking for copies of the paper.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r_94870619992ab047c0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dreaming of jelly babies : English Channel swimming and the challenges and comforts of food</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28AAE8A9-A6EB-41D7-A2B5-0F548D54DDE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a light-hearted talk given during the drinks reception at the annual conference of the BSA Food Study Group, held at the British Library on 2-3 July, 2012.

This was followed by a discussion about people's experiences of sport, and of swimming, and the following week, two of the members gave a presentation on their own recent entry into open water swimming.
