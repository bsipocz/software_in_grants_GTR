Unlike other research that looks at the effects of schools attended on outcomes, this research will focus on the effect of NOT going to one's most preferred school. The aim is to focus on the consequences of school choice.

The analysis will be quantitative and will involve detailed statistical analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE). This dataset follows 17000 young people from age 14 through the education system and into the labour market. They are now 25 and the last sweep of the dataset is about to become available to researchers. The dataset gives rich information about the child, the parents, and the school. 

The outcomes that we will go beyond investigate are the educational attainments that is the usual focus of attention for researchers (GCSE's and A-levels) to include well-being, mental health, being bullied, absence, crime, teen sex and pregnancy, and a range of non-cognitive skills (conscientiousness, and the like). Importantly, these students are followed through their higher education experience so we can investigate the impact of being in a second best school on: aspirations to higher education, application, attending an elite institution, dropping-out, and degree class. Finally, the data now contains some earnings and employment information from the subjects' early experiences of the labour market.

School choice involves a trade-off between school proximity and school quality. One might most prefer a local excellent school but if that is not available the choice might be between a local school, that is of satisfactory quality, and a more distant school that is of better quality. The choices that parents make for their children will balance the better school quality against the inconvenience of extra travel time, among other things. This new research will exploit earlier research that analyses the preferences that parents have for schools for their children - based on the preferences expressed by all parents in England for two recent cohorts. This earlier research provides statistical estimates of the extent to which parents are prepared to trade off lesser proximity for better quality. 

We use our knowledge of this trade-off in this much richer dataset. We can calculate the distance between home and school attended in the LSYPE data and we know the quality of that school - for example, in terms of % with 5+ A-C GCSEs. And we can see the location of other schools that one might have attended and we observe their quality and proximity. Our estimates allow us to calculate the probability of attending each potential school, from our knowledge of the admission criteria. The work will inform policymakers about the benefits of providing better choices, and will inform parents about the benefits of making better choices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries include DfE, Local Education Authorities, potential entrants to the &amp;quot;free school&amp;quot; market, headteachers considering the impact of school choice policies, and Regional School Commissioners. There is potential for impact elsewhere - in NI and Scotland for example who are in the process of developing their own databases; and in the US where policy is in limbo right now since Obama's ESSA has had its funds frozen and the new administration has not developed a policy to replace it. 

The project will benefit future children and their parents. It will cast light on the importance of the characteristics of schools, not just for academic for achievement, but for the well-being of the child. This will help parents make better choices. We hope to engage the Behavioural Insights Team in the work.

It will also impact on the DfE. It will tell them about how much school quality and school proximity matters for outcomes. It will illuminate, in detail, how the school choice mechanism is working on average - and, importantly, for different types of children..... the gifted and talented, those with SENs, and by gender, ethicity, and month of birth (an indicator of maturity). This will help Whitehall identify choice coldspots and hotspots and the value of moderating them. 

As well as central government we hope to impact on the new Regional School Commissioners - whose job is it to go beyond school improvement and consider the coordination of schooling as a whole in their areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R003629/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
