We aim to establish a purpose and commonality within a structure of PhD cohorts, learning from our recently established Centers for Doctoral Training, 
http://www.liv.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/postgraduate-research/doctoral-training/
and embedded in our core disciplines in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematical Sciences, Engineering, and Computer Science. 
All of our post graduate research opportunities can be found at:

Projects 
Recruitment of doctoral training studentships is focused in areas of strategic research excellence that address key global challenges. Examples of our 2014-15 projects include: 
Energy: 
Development of Energy Nanocapsules 
http://www.liv.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/postgraduate-opportunities/development-of-energy-nanocapsules/
Lithium Rich Transition Metal Oxides as High Capacity and High Voltage Li-ion Battery Cathodes 
http://www.liv.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/postgraduate-opportunities/lithium-rich-transition-metal-oxides/
Materials Science &amp;amp; Engineering: 
Design, engineering and characterisation of Antimicrobial Surfaces 
http://www.liv.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/postgraduate-opportunities/design-engineering-and-characterisation-of-antimicrobial-surfaces/
Asymmetric Synthesis via Metal-Catalysed Activation of C-H and C-C Bonds 
http://www.liv.ac.uk/chemistry/postgraduate/postgraduate-opportunities/asymmetric-synthesis-via-metal-catalysed-activation-of-c-h-and-c-c-bonds/
Our postgraduate research opportunities will be updated as 2015-16 projects are confirmed. 
PhD Training: 
All students emerge from their PhD training with a flexible mind set, able to communicate across different disciplines and sectors and with the confidence and foundations to develop in to leaders of their fields. A key objective is to involve students in driving and determining their own skills training and development, aided by the transferable skills training programme. Through the recent establishment of the Liverpool Doctoral College, students will have access to a development programme which is tailored to the needs of the individual and supports interdisciplinary working (students may draw on modules and training opportunities from all three of our faculties). The programme places a focus on employability and entrepreneurship and will provide the skills needed for doctoral study and for future careers in academia, industry and other areas of the economy.
Personal &amp;amp; professional development training is offered in: 
 Methods 
 Communication 
 Impact 
 Ethics &amp;amp; Governance 
 Employability &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship 

Timetable for decisions EPSRC doctoral training funding is processed and distributed annually to departments who allocate funding to supervisors in the coming academic session. Projects are advertised no later than January. All of our post graduate research opportunities can be found at http://www.liv.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/postgraduate-research/ 
Student applications are made to the primary supervisor through a University application process. Students are selected following an interview process involving a second member of academic staff. Specific details about how to apply, including the closing dates, are detailed in each project summary.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2101398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509693/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
