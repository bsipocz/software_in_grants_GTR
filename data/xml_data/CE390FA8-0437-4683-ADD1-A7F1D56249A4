These communities have until recently been left out of urban based development, with the consequence of depopulation as villagers move to cities. This has created age and gender based imbalances, as well as leaving many buildings in a poor state of repair. This situation has given rise to a loss of knowledge and skills in arts and crafts that would underpin local community sustainability.

The choice of locus in Southwest China arises because of: the remoteness of the region and of many villages; the relative lack of economic prosperity compared to eastern provinces on the Pacific Rim; and the underutilised wealth of cultural and ethnic diversity and scenic locations present there. These factors provide an inviting opportunity, not to say necessity, to develop and reinforce traditional skills, vernacular design, and creative arts and craft industries to support village based development.

The migration to cities in cities in China and their rapid development is already well-known and there have been numerous projects researching urban sustainability from economic, environmental and social perspectives. However even with the planned increasing urbanisation of the population, about 600 million people will continue to live in rural and village locations. It is towards the future prosperity and sustainable development of such places that this network will focus its efforts. In order to achieve this, the Network will be constructed to enable collaboration between China-based partners; with the influence of the UK Project Team being on facilitation, support and encouragement. A particular feature of the network will be the linkages between well-established academic and non-academic participants and those who are either relatively new participants or located more remotely (both organisational type and geographically) but who have key local and skills based understanding and experience to contribute.

The need to enhance rural and village development was first officially recognised in the 11th 5 Year Plan of the Peoples Republic of China published in 2005 and this was reinforced by elements of the 13th 5 Year Plan set out in 2015. It is clear from recent visits made by the UK Project Team in 2016 and 2017 that efforts are being made to speed up village redevelopment but with potential for unintended negative consequences. These arise because of lack of linkages and mutual understandings between top-down and bottom-up processes that have previously been reported. There is also an emerging risk with current methods of redevelopment which sees factory produced artefacts and unsuitable building techniques being used as substitutes for locally produced authentic products.

There are however some good examples of village redevelopment and also a wealth of knowledge existing in pockets of expertise; the urgent task is to understand how to disseminate information on exemplars and from experts, as well as how to research future optimisation. Operationally there are three key elements: firstly the establishment of the Network; secondly the holding of Network meetings and open workshop events in different locations; and thirdly the dissemination and circulation of information and outcomes through the second level of networking which each of the main collaborators will deliver as part of the project.

Direct outcomes will again come in three main ways: firstly the identification and prioritisation of research and development needs and the options for development; secondly the bidding for funds from academic and non-academic sources to help deal with the necessary research and development facilitated by the Network; and thirdly the publication of outputs. 

The Network is expected to continue beyond the initial funding period so as to deal with rural/village needs over a 5-10 year period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Initial impacts will be achieved through Network events and also through the sub-networks which are aligned around participants and collaborators. The prime purpose is to influence future sustainable development in the south-western provinces of China and to develop new research fields and methods; each leading to informed policy development. These are important future impacts.

Groups who will benefits include:
- Academics active in the topic areas of traditional building and craft skills, who will learn about how to apply technologies and techniques in new ways or settings - they will also benefit from improved and enhanced research opportunities in what is a crucial area of development at the present time in China
- Professionals in the fields of design and construction in rural and village areas - these include architects, planners, and skilled trades-people who will become acquainted with techniques that enable more sustainable redevelopment of rural and village areas;
- Commercial organisations who will benefits from the development of new markets and through better understanding of local needs;
- Village communities and rural areas will also benefit by help to re-emphasise and understand the traditional skills which they embody and which might be expanded through the network outcomes and developments;
- Individuals who are located in villages will also have potential to develop skills and businesses;
- The tourism industry has potential to exploit potential for visitors to rural and village areas - and this is already being encouraged (SW China is home to many examples of intangible cultural heritage as well as many traditional villages identified for preservation);
- The wider environment should also profit from more efficient and more sustainable technologies and techniques being employed in buildings and craft skills areas with greater use of local resources and lower transport costs.
- There are expected to be positive economic and societal impacts; and enhanced potential to create comfortable and pleasant environments in and around dwellings and other rural and village buildings.

A focus on users and stakeholders within communities will help develop positive social and cultural aspects and the needs of these groups will be considered throughout the term of the network; impacts will be enhanced through capture of outcomes by the academic stakeholders and analysis leading to better understanding of knowledge pathways in this topic area - this is something which is complex and difficult to understand in this field of work meaning research has enhanced value.

Intellectual assets are not prime outputs of the network but can be expected to develop from future projects and funding bids. The initial new IP content is expected to be small with processes and collaboration initially supported and overseen by the UK team, with expectation that each group will take responsibility for development into future projects. The links provided by the Research Network should enable mutual support from those with greater experience to leverage better outcomes for those with less experience. The networking process should also foster career development as well as research knowledge and skills.

The intensive research meetings are expected to deliver immediate benefits and impacts to those taking part whilst the workshop events will provide dissemination routes to create longer terms prospects for benefits amongst a wider group.

Support from the Centre for Sustainable and Resilient Communities at the University of Huddersfield (http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/csrc/introduction/) will also help ensure the Research Network continues to develop with an emphasis on application of research outcomes and dissemination of outcomes and outputs.

Impacts will involve interactions with a number of groups as well as members of the public and processes used will follow best practice and adhere to ethical standards.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48438</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004129/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63F3D26F-05D5-477D-9F77-C6C8AC47C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Research approaches</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15FF42B9-E8E0-4428-BAF1-5EBBA88C2D38</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
