Aviation currently accounts for about 2% of human-induced CO2 emissions with more than 3.12 billion passengers and 48 million tons of freight worldwide last year with an average of more than 100,000 flights every day. Worldwide traffic is predicted to grow at a rate of 4% to 5% per year for the next 30 years. It simply means that more than 16 billion passengers and 25 million flights are expected in 2050. Aviation will have to find ways to meet the growing demand for air transport whilst reducing its environmental impact, specifically the level of noise and of carbon emissions. Innovative solutions are also needed to deal with fuel consumption so that aviation does not become increasingly dependent on more and more expensive energy sources. It is clear that it requires a significant step change in the technologies of future aircraft.

In recent years, the development of devices known as plasma actuators has advanced the promise of controlling flows in new ways that increase lift, reduce drag and improve aerodynamic efficiencies, advances that may lead to safer, more efficient and quieter aircraft. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators consist of two electrodes, one exposed to the ambient fluid and the other covered by a dielectric material. When an A.C. voltage is applied between the two electrodes the ambient fluid over the covered electrode ionizes. This ionized fluid is called the plasma and results
in a body force vector which exchanges momentum with the ambient, neutrally charged, fluid. 

For this project, high-resolution simulations will be carried out on the most powerful supercomputers in Europe in order to demonstrate the potential of DBD plasma actuators for the control of turbulent jets. The problem of jet noise pollution has become more severe in the past few decades due to the ever increasing number of flights, the tightening of environmental impact regulations, and the development of urban/residential areas in close proximity to airports. The scientific objective of the present project is to advance our understanding of aeroacoustic mechanisms up to the point where we can
propose targeted plasma control strategies for free shear flows to tackle the problem of jet noise pollution. This research project is a first step in the development of new technologies based on plasma actuators in the aeronautic sector not only for noise reduction purposes but also potentially for mixing enhancement and for a better efficiency of jet engines.

As of today, active flow control technologies have not been implemented in commercial aircraft. The large number of parameters (location of the actuator, orientation, size, relative placement of the embedded and exposed electrodes, applied voltage, frequency) affecting the performance of plasma actuators makes their development, testing and optimisation a very complicated task. Experimental approaches require numerous high-cost and time consuming trial-and-error iterations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can complement ideally experiments with the potential to investigate in
detail plasma-actuator controlled turbulent flows.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By 2032 it estimated that worldwide more than 29,000 new large civil airliners, 24,000 business jets, 5,800 regional aircraft and 40,000 helicopters will be required to deal with the constant increase of the worldwide traffic. For instance, more than 16 billion passengers per year worldwide are expected in 2050. Aviation will have to find ways to meet this growing demand whilst reducing its environmental impact, specifically the level of noise and of carbon emission. It is clear that it requires a significant step change in the technologies of future aircraft. The UK is directly concerned by this challenge as it the second national aerospace industry in the world, with a 17% global market share for a turnover of more than &amp;pound;20 billion every year, sustaining directly and indirectly more than 200,000 jobs.

This application proposes to investigate the potential for noise reduction of a very promising active flow control strategy based on plasma actuators. 
Plasma actuators can be used in a wide range of engineering applications such as viscous drag reduction and boundary layer separation control in low-speed flows, shock wave modification and wave drag reduction in supersonic and transonic flows, and supersonic boundary layer transition control. The idea here is to use them to manipulate a turbulent round jet in order to either reduce the acoustic sources or to minimise their propagation.
The number of active flow control devices that have successfully transitioned from a laboratory prototype to a real-world aeronautical application is still relatively small and the proposed Computational Fluid Dynamics project is offering a great opportunity to explore active control strategies as a complement to experiments. Another important aspect of this project is related to the identification of acoustic noise in a turbulent flow. To develop efficient noise reduction strategy, it is necessary to understand where the noise is coming from. The main problem in identifying the acustic sources is that they often get eclipsed by the much larger turbulent fluctuations and become inaccessible if evaluated directly. This project is aiming to propose a general framework for the identification of acoustic sources in turbulent flows based on indirect evaluation of the acoustic sources and their propagations.

The Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College has agreed to provide a DTA student to work on this project. This student and the PDRA funded by this grant will become experienced scientists in High Performance Computing and in the manipulation of turbulent flows. They will both attend High Performance Computing training sessions organised by the UK supercomputing service ARCHER. They will both collaborate with the team of Professor Choi from the University of Nottingham as it is the UK experimental leading research group for active flow control strategies using plasma actuators. Finally, they will also interact with the PhD students from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Fluid Mechanics across the Scales at Imperial College to develop their lecture skills.

Plasma actuators are one of the most promising technologies to manipulate a turbulent jet with strong potential benefits in mixing efficiency for combustion, propulsion efficiency and noise reduction. However, a thorough scientific understanding of this new active control solution is required before it can be implemented at an industrial scale. Only very few research groups in the UK are working on active plasma control solutions. This research project will hopefully encourage other research groups to start using plasma actuator in their research as it can be applied to a wide range of flow configurations. It will also hopefully arouse curiosity and interest from the many aerospace industries in the UK looking for innovative active flow control solutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Poitiers</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Modelling of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Actuators for Direct Numerical Simulations</gtr:description><gtr:id>14DBB364-7310-445A-9539-09AC601BCB15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1 conference paper for 8th AIAA Flow Control Conference, AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum and Exposition 2016, Washington DC, USA

Modern airliner engines are jet Turbofan engines. They are extremely efficient but terribly noisy. One way of reducing noise is to simply cuts the trailing edge of the engine's exit nozzle in a repeated saw-tooth pattern. These are called chevron nozzles. They can reduce noise levels during landing and take off by few decibels. However, they are associated with a trust penalty during flight. 

The research funded on this grant demonstrated that it seems to be possible to use plasma actuators to mimic chevrons at the engine's exit nozzle. The plasma actuators can be turned off during flight (no trust penalty) and are only activated at landing and take off when noise levels need to be reduced. Further work is needed in order fully understand the underlying physics and to optimise the various parameters of this innovative active flow control solution (location of the actuator, orientation, size, relative placement of the embedded and exposed electrodes, applied voltage, frequency).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All the numerical tools developed during this research project are freely available on demand.

Dedicated to Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES), it can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes. It scales with up to one million cores. 
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized with finite-difference sixth-order schemes on a Cartesian mesh. Explicit or semi-implicit temporal schemes can be used for the time advancement depending on the flow configuration. To treat the incompressibility condition, a fractional step method requires to solve a Poisson equation. This equation is fully solved in spectral space via the use of relevant 3D Fast Fourier transforms(FFTs), allowing any kind of boundary conditions for the velocity field in each spatial direction. Using the concept of the modified wavenumber, the divergence free condition is ensured up to machine accuracy. The pressure field is staggered from the velocity field by half a mesh to avoid spurious oscillations. 
The modelling of a solid body inside the computational domain is performed with a customised Immersed Boundary Method. It is based on a direct forcing to ensure a no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the solid body while imposing non-zero velocities inside the solid body to avoid discontinuities on the velocity field. This customised IBM, fully compatible with the 2D domain decomposition and with a possible mesh refinement at the wall, is based on a 1D expansion of the velocity field from fluid regions into solid regions using Lagrange polynomials. 
To reach realistic Reynolds numbers, an implicit LES strategy can be implemented to solve the Navier-Stokes equations without any extra explicit modelling. In order to mimic a subgrid-scale model, artificial dissipation can be added via the viscous term thanks to the artificial dissipative features of the high-order compact schemes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8138E61-41AE-46E9-9593-99EAE4043C9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>--&amp;gt;More than 500 publications so far for work based on Incompact3d
