Those who deliberately embraced suffering could be understood as heroes, as mentally unstable, or as perverts. This project focuses on two areas of such controversies. The first is the connections between martyrdom and political subversion through an examination of the interrelations between visual imagery and textual discourses of martyrdom and terrorism. The second is the way in which images of martyrdom, notably those derived from Roman Catholicism, helped to shape aspects of sexual dissidence such as the cultural formation of same-sex desire at the end of the nineteenth century. The key aims of this research are to connect together areas of scholarship carried out by those in history, art history and religious studies and to produce an interdisciplinary study of cultural formations which focus on the nineteenth century, but which pay heed to long-term historical trends and developments through to the present day.\n\nThis research is the culmination of a project carried out by myself as sole researcher which was begun at Birkbeck, University of London in 2008. It is a development from my previous research project into the controversial reception of Anglo-Catholic material culture as morally subversive idolatry during the mid-nineteenth century, a reception which showed strong Protestant fears of links between political treachery and sexual subversion. This project builds on such understandings and, by so doing, argues that academics in a range of disciplines from political to cultural history, art history and religious studies can benefit from the development of work which highlights the interactions between political, religious and cultural formations. This research project aims to highlight key opportunities provided by thinking beyond conventional classifications of types of subversion such as heresy, treachery, terrorism and perversion by examining them in juxtaposition. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The nineteenth century saw the evolution of distinctive western forms of political and sexual identity which grew out of, but also challenged, conventions derived from long-standing religiously influenced traditions of obedience to legitimate authority. The topics of research into these issues are of wide contemporary interest as can be seen through an examination of recent media preoccupation with such phenomena as religiously inspired terrorism and 'gays in the Church'. Engagement with wider audiences has been considered from the start of this research project. In 2011 I am organising a conference in association with the University of Notre Dame London Center into images of terrorism and martyrdom. In addition to the organisation of working sessions in which academic participants discuss each other's research, there will be a programme of external communication to ensure wider access to plenary talks on key topics. There may be an opportunity to tie this into the role which the Notre Dame Center has established as a 'satellite' location of the Battle of Ideas Programme which is organised by the Institute of Ideas (http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2009/partner_detail/2655/).\n\nAs part of the proposed fellowship programme I intend to develop an outreach event which will present some of the key findings from the final phase of research to a public audience in 2012. This is currently at the earliest planning stages, but I am intending to work with a number of faith and secular groups to develop a speaker event in which representatives from a number of bodies (such as, for instance, the Church of England, the Unitarians and the British Humanist Association) will give their responses to my presentation of materials from the research. I would envisage that information would also be made available online through participating organisations to ensure wider dissemination of key themes, ideas and debates. It may be possible to link this into GayLesbianBisexualTrans History Month 2012, which is due to take place in March (see http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/).\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33306</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research was disseminated not simply via publications but also via a variety of talks. In addition in 2015 an event took place at University of the Arts London on images of martyrdom and terrorism which led on from aspects of the project research. This brought together media professionals, creative practitioners and academics to explore and critique aspects of images of martyrdom and dissidence, drawing on paradigms established during the course of the research project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>231C0589-E5F4-4218-8F7C-5D3350A26D30</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5436b5e4cdd828.58401066</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research project has established that Catholic forms of Christianity played a key role in the evolution of the culture and visual expression of homosexuality and male same-sex desire in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. I explored this relationship through the idea of queer martyrdom-closeted queer servitude to Christ-a concept that allowed a certain degree of latitude for the development of same-sex desire. I found the beginnings of queer martyrdom in the nineteenth-century Church of England and the controversies over Cardinal John Henry Newman's sexuality. I then considered how liturgical expression of queer desire in the Victorian Eucharist provided inspiration for artists looking to communicate their own feelings of sexual deviance. After looking at Victorian monasteries as queer families, I analyzed how the Biblical story of David and Jonathan could be used to create forms of same-sex partnerships. Finally, I explored how artists and writers employed ecclesiastical material culture to further queer self-expression, concluding with studies of Oscar Wilde and Derek Jarman that illustrate both the limitations and ongoing significance of Christianity as an inspiration for expressions of homoerotic desire.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This can be taken forward to explore parallels in women's experience or in comparative contexts in other countries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CA13EA9F-5049-4FE4-BD90-A201B00C93AD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5436b3ba0ccbc8.45399209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6B4F7B2-8A9B-40F9-A18D-FE1A687C5E1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visions of Queer Martyrdom from John Henry Newman to Derek Jarman</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/977a0eb6f0251f99958e44527b51228c"><gtr:id>977a0eb6f0251f99958e44527b51228c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Janes Dominic</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780226250618</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>589a1867d7bc22.43697317</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C80CB37-A009-4DC4-A514-6EAB5E4E128C</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The &amp;quot;modern martyrdom&amp;quot; of Anglo-Catholics in Victorian England'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Religion and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4011af9f55fbd623da930cc2233a7cee"><gtr:id>4011af9f55fbd623da930cc2233a7cee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Janes, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5436b14e0a0d49.07710410</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001433/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
