The patchy distribution of many complex characters (segmentation, coelomic cavities, eyes, central nervous system, etc.) across the animals could be interpreted in two ways: either as resulting from repeated convergent evolution of similar characters for adaptive reasons or as primitive characters that, while maintained in certain groups, have also been lost in multiple lineages. This proposal seeks to differentiate between these two scenarios for two important characters with a puzzling phylogenetic distribution amongst metazoan phyla: a through-gut and ciliated larvae. The platyhelminthes or flatworms are an important group of animals. Some are free living but others are important parasites such as tapeworms and schistosomes (the cause of Bilharzia which affects over 200 million people worldwide). They have a relatively simple body without a through gut (i.e. no separate mouth and anus) nor do they have the internal fluid filled cavities or segmented body plans seen in many other animal groups such as annelid worms (e.g. earth worms) or molluscs. For many years there was an assumption that their relative simplicity was an indication that they separated early from the main branches of the animal tree: many hundreds of millions of years ago and before the evolution of these more advanced traits. Recently it has been established that this view of their relationships to other animal groups is incorrect and that they are in fact relatively closely related to the annelids and molluscs in a large assemblage of animals called the Lophotrochozoa. This relationship implies that they originally possessed the through gut, body cavities and segments seen in their relatives but have lost them secondarily. We want to test this idea directly by looking for genetic traces of these characteristics in their larvae. The larvae of flatworms resemble, to an extent, the larvae of annelids and molluscs (a tiny ciliated swimming stage called a trochophore). We want to test, using genetic markers again, whether annelid, mollusc and flatworm larvae are in fact all inherited from a common ancestor (the progenitor of the Lophotrochozoa) that also had a larva. If so flatworm larvae would be expected to share specific genetic characteristics with the trochophore larvae of annelids and molluscs whereas if the larvae have been evolved independently in annelids and flatworms this would not be the case. This will tell us about the possibility of adding a larval stage into your lifecycle - a very controversial idea - and also inform us about the characteristics of the common ancestor of the lophotrochozoan animals which existed half a billion years ago. Finally we want to use the genetic data we generate in the parts of the project already described to refine our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between flatworms and all the other lophotrochozoan groups. An understanding of these relationships will better enable us to interpret the evolution of the characteristics that interest us.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Flatworms have a simple body plan and crucially lack body cavities, segmentation and a through gut; this simplicity meant they were long thought of as an early branch in metazoan evolution. Their inclusion in Lophotrochozoa alongside complex annelids and molluscs led to the inference that their simplicity must be secondarily evolved. Our first aim is to test this assumption by looking for genetic traces of a through-gut or for evidence of the primitiveness of their blind-ended gut in their embryos. We will look at expression of genes involved in mouth/anus patterning to understand the origins of these gut openings. The larvae of some platyhelminths resemble trochophore larvae common in marine annelids and molluscs. This controversial comparison is part of the argument over whether primary larvae within all Metazoa are homologous. The second aim is to establish or refute homology of platyhelminth and trochophore larvae. We will use two approaches: - Cell lineage analysis to see whether the ciliary band and apical organ of platyhelminth larvae are derived from the same blastomeres as their counterparts in trochophores. - Gene expression analysis to look for complex similarities, in terms of gene expression domains, between apical organs and ciliary bands of platyhelminth larvae and their supposed trochophoran homologs. We will use a relatively simple technique - in situ hybridisation - to determine the expression patterns of the target genes but will analyse the products of these experiments with state of the art methods for storing and aligning 3 dimensional expression patterns in a computer. This approach has been shown by one of our collaborators to allow cell specific comparisons of expression of all genes studied. Finally we will use EST sequence data (produced by 454 sequencing and also used for gene discovery) to refine our knowledge of the position of flatworms within the Lophotrochozoa</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries within the public sector. I have a long-standing association with the Natural History Museum (I worked there for 6 years and since 2000 have been a Scientific Associate). The work we propose to undertake is into fundamental principles of metazoan evolution including phylogenetics of an important major clade of animals (Lophotrochozoa). This research into the patterns and processes of evolution are of direct relevance to the research of museum scientists and curators as well as being of obvious interest for inclusion in the museums exhibits. I am also a member of the council of the Linnean Society and of the Systematics association and the outputs of our research will similarly be of great interest to the membership of these societies. Beneficiaries within the wider public There is significant public interest in the understanding of Evolution. The planned research, while cutting edge science, is nevertheless readily explained to the public. Evolution is widely covered in newspapers and books, radio and television, and particularly so this year in the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin. The UK is a leader in this field of research. I have been involved in a number of radio, television and newspaper interviews covering my research in the past (our research on the worm Xenoturbella was very widely covered and even made it into the Sunday telegraph A-Z of the year). In 2007 I took a significant part in a Radio 4 programme celebrating the 300th anniversary of the birth of Linneaus. In general I am keen to communicate my work and the broader aspects of evolutionary biology to the public by whatever means. Commercial private sector There are possibilities for exploitation of our research in the commercial sector. Maritigrella (the polyclad on which we work) is currently being studied by PharmaMar, a Spanish pharmaceutical company, interested in its ability to concentrate ecteinascidins a type of anti-tumor compound derived from its food source. We are in contact with this company and they are keen to have collaborate. We will provide early access to our EST data set which may aid them in gene discovery and longer term we would hope they will benefit from any advances we make in understanding the biology and in developing manipulation/culturing techniques for use on Maritigrella. Other practical/commercial work on Maritigrella has been undertaken by the aquaculture division of the Harbour branch oceanographic institute (we are in contact with John Scarpa and Amy Wright who were responsible for this research), again due to its potential importance as a source of anti-cancer compounds.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>592597</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interviewed for article on openSPIM light sheet microscopy in Nature methods</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41C16D6E-608F-42C6-A569-ADFD14A6A5B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Graduate student Johannes Girstmair interviewed on his self built light sheet microscope principally funded by BBSRC</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a0aa088f02.51995007</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2016/12/building-openspim-systems.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interviewed for article on light sheet microscopy by 'The Scientist' magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B936105C-96E8-4153-881B-A8613D7C8102</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviewed for article on light sheet microscopy by 'The Scientist' magazine.

Of use to other interested workers. This has been accessed over 8000 times on the journal webpage.

Using BBSRC funding we have built an open-spim microscope (selective plane illumination microscope) which will allow us to study the early development of this animal in 4d (i.e. 3 spatial dimensions + time). This will be used by other members of the group.

We have sequenced the adult transcriptomes of 15 species of flatworm including our model species for inference of phylogeny using a very large and complete dataset. This is being written up. It is allowing us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of gene content across the phylum. The transcriptomes will be made available to other workers.

We have produced a preliminary assembly of the very large genome (2.5Gb) of our study animal. Once improved (pacbio seq in progress) this will be of great use to us and collaborators and anyone interested in animal comparative genomics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A4B15E4E-345A-4556-B035-4205FE8F87FB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cde0ad76ed0.52660279</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In situ hybridisation protocol.
The foundation of major parts of the project proposal was establishing an in situ hybridisation protocol for Maritigrella larvae. We have not succeeded despite having synthesised a large number of probes of developmental, housekeeping and neuropeptide genes with three different haptens and tried many protocols working for other species 

Due to the difficulties we have encountered we have used an alternative approach involving the production of antibodies. We have produced successful antibodies against 10 neuropeoptides and several of our genes of interest as outlined in the proposal. 

The main problem encountered with applying our new antibodies in stainings was the difficulty in imaging the three-dimensional lobed larvae of Maritigrella. While the dorsoventrally flattened juveniles of direct developers could be easily imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the tissue attenuation in the larvae resulted in much weaker signal on the parts most distant from the light-receiving objective. To ameliorate this situation, we are using light sheet microscopy on immunostained M. crozieri larvae. We have built our own spim microscope. 

We developed a protocol to produce 'naked' embryos (embryos without egg shell) of Maritigrella and succeeded in following the early development with time lapse microscopy using standard light microscopy. Following individual blastomeres beyond the ca. 40-cell stage becomes difficult due to opaqueness caused by yolk granules and a rather low survival rate of the embryos under the microscope. To solve this problem we have used injection of histone-mCherry mRNA which is readily translated and stably marks the nuclei of dividing blastomeres through developement. We are now using fluorescent light sheet microscopy to record the cell divisions and cell movements in 3 dimensions throughout development (overall 4d microscopy). When complete, this will permit us to examine the blastomere origins of any given larval organ including eyes, apical organ and ciliary band directly aiding us in our principal aim.

Determining with some certainty the phylogenetic position of the polyclad flatworms within the platyhelminthes is an important task (not discussed in the original proposal). We collected representatives of most larger taxa of free-living flatworms, extracted total RNA, and sequenced and assembled complete transcriptomes. We are collaborating with Dr Christophe Dessimoz (recently appointed to UCL) to use his OMA software to identify large sets of orthologs amongst the platyhelminthes and other lophoptrochozoans for building a phylogenetic tree based on hundreds to thousands of orthologous genes. Initial results are very promising and we can show the transcriptomes are very complete allowing us to build a really impressive data matrix for phylogeny.

Genome sequencing.
From a single starved adult, we extracted about 100 &amp;micro;g of undegraded DNA, which was sequenced in libraries of four different insert sizes (200, 500, 3000 and 7000 basepairs) on 8 lanes (6 paired end and 2 mate pair) of an Illumina Hiseq machine. We initiated collaboration with Prof. Dr. Eugene Myers at the MPI Dresden and Dr. Siegfried Schloissnig at the Heidelberg Institute of Higher Studies for assembly of the Maritigrella crozieri genome.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will shortly publish the results of pour analyses and make available the ~15 platyheminth transcriptomes we have produced during this grant.
