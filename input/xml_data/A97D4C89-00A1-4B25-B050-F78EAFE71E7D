Within the USSR this was exemplified by Stalin's own cult, and by the founding cult of Lenin from which it derived its claimed legitimacy. Communism, however, was also an international political movement of unprecedented scope and cohesion, for which the export of Soviet cultic practices provided representation and reinforcement of a culture of centralised control. By the time these practices reached their apogee in the Cold War years of 'high Stalinism', mimetic cults existed in almost every communist party, with a clearly marked international hierarchy culminating in Stalin himself. The leader cult phenomenon, as manifested in countries where communists held power, has given rise to a wide inter-disciplinary literature opening up fruitful lines for further research. As yet, however, there exists no general or comparative study of the genesis, functioning and reception of the leader cults within non-ruling communist parties. This research provides such a study. 

Covering the period of 1917-64, its chronological scope is set on the one hand by the Russian revolution and founding of the Communist International, and on the other by destalinisation and the passing of a 'Stalin generation' of communist leaders. Its comparative approach extends across the communist parties of Europe and north America, and the communist phenomenon of the leader cult is itself considered in a broader comparative context. Incorporated within this framework is a more intensive focus on the communist parties of Britain and France. These were generally legal, public bodies and they offer extensive documentation of the cults in their diverse representations, from poetry and pageant to exemplary lives and the rituals and protocols of communist meetings. As well as examples of the domestic leader cult in the shape of Harry Pollitt and Maurice Thorez, international cults can be reconstructed through their export and mediation within distinct political milieux. As well as the defining cults of Lenin and Stalin, the research examines a broader cast of internationally prominent leaders. The figure of revolutionary tribune or martyr is traced through Georgi Dimitrov, hero of the Reichstag fire trial, and the imprisoned German leader Ernst Th&amp;auml;lmann. Though articulated in strikingly different ways, a commonality of the cults was their masculinist construction. For this reason, the exceptional international standing of the Spanish communist leader Pasionaria' is also given close attention.

The generation and promotion of the leader cults has been seen as a straightforward replication and transmission of Stalin's personalised leadership model. This research, however, suggests that their licensing of was a matter of paradox and considerable tension. Intended as an expression of collective authority, individualised cults threatened it through the accumulation of personal political capital. This was certainly addressed: through the anti-individualism of exemplary party lives, or though clear and explicit subordination to the higher cult of Stalin. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of the lesser cults may be compared with that of the 'little Stalins' in the USSR. Leadership crises sometimes resulted, and the party's collective force was regularly turned against the 'anti-cults' by which the individualised figure of the traitor or backslider was anathematised.

Historians have postulated a basic distinction between leader cults proper and the glorification of leaders in more open polities The functioning of 'closed' parties within 'open' systems may help clarify and problematise such distinctions and offer new insight into the 'modern' phenomenon of the mass political leader. Within the expanding literature on the modern culture of personality, study of the communist leader cult offers new perspective on the relations between narratives of individuation and the vaunted age of the masses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal direct beneficiaries of the research will be fellow academics. However, the subject of the research is of interest to an audience beyond the purely academic one. Through visual, cinematic and literary representations the leader cult phenomenon is a familiar one. Europe's age of dictators continues to figure on 'A'-level history syllabuses. Popular publications in the area appear with some frequency. Through surviving communist regimes, or the use of cultic practices by figures like Saddam Hussein, the subject retains topicality as well as historical interest. 

The construction of mimetic cults does not have quite the same resonance for this wider audience. Its forms of representation were more limited; the public memory of the leaders involved is weak. Nevertheless, in Britain as in other countries, a relatively marginal communist party continues to attract disproportionate interest because and provides an immediate point of access to one of the defining political movements of the twentieth century. There is also a distinct public community with interests in the history of labour and other forms of political activism. The extent of this interest can be gauged by the People's History Museum's successful 'Reds!' exhibition in 2004, or the popular histories, broadcasts and polemics produced by journalists like Francis Beckett, David Aaronovitch and Nick Cohen. The applicant was academic consultant to the 'Reds!' exhibition and has assisted each of the journalists named. In managing the impact of the research he will have the professional support of Mike Addelman, the University's Media Relations Officer for the Humanities. A number of strategies have already been identified to disseminate the research through forums and networks extending beyond the immediate academic community. 

A public roundtable comparing communist and fascist leader cults will be held at a prominent venue in Manchester and promoted to a wide audience including 'A'-level history students. A podcast or recording of the roundtable will be made available through the Cultmep website. The applicant has given many talks to to public and local history audiences and is actively involved with labour history libraries and archives. He will continue to use any opportunity to address research findings to such audiences.

A new critical edition of Harry's Pollitt's popular autobiography Serving My Time is in preparation and will be published by its original publishers Lawrence &amp;amp; Wishart. This will be promoted to a wide readership with interests in labour and social history. Launch events will be held in the Manchester region to address potential interest in the local history community.

Research findings will be disseminated via the Twentieth Century Communism blog and a variety of international publications with which the applicant has established connections. Through ongoing international collaborations, summaries or aspects of the research will be disseminated in English, German, French, Hungarian, Finnish and Portuguese. Opportunity will also be sought to publicise the research through popular history magazines.

The main priority of the Fellowship will be completion of the monograph. However, the applicant has a proven track record of engaging with wider audiences and the proposed research will feed into this continued activity over a longer time-scale.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84768</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>17 minute documentary film employing original footage and interviews with contemporary scholars</gtr:description><gtr:id>98B36EB5-BA27-4E73-AC96-1C2435429B2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Film was uploaded to youtube Feb. 20156 and will be soft-released on the UoM School of Social Sciences video channel in March 2016.

The research has provided the first transnational study of the cult of the individual under communism extending to communist parties which did not exercise power as well as those that did. It also considers the cults of ruling communist figures like Stalin in their hitherto been somewhat neglected transnational aspect. 2. The research consequently includes detailed discussion or case studies of a wide range of national cases or individual political cults including France, Belgium, Britain, USA, Italy, Brazil, Germany, Spain and Russia/USSR. 3. Through consideration of the cult phenomenon in both 'closed' and 'open' societies it raises complex questions around the figure of the leader in twentieth-century politics, and this is recognised in the study through the ideas of the integrating cult and enkindling cult which are fully elaborated with reference to such key concepts as charisma and political capital. 4. Through focusing on period 1917-56 and not just the Cold War heyday of the cults, the study also proposes a more sophisticated periodisation to accommodate their variations over time as well as place and their representation through diverse media and such genres as the cult biography.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings will initially be taken forward through completion of some or all of those of may original objectives that are still to be fulfilled, which primarily are those linked with the popularisation of the research. Priorities will be (I) dissemination through a popular history magazine; (ii) the critical edition of the Harry Pollitt autobiography for which the publishers have given their agreement in principle (but for which the archival findings in the Comintern archives turned out to be rather disappointing); (iii) the possible editing of an international collection on the cult phenomenon, for which interest was expressed after the Manchester conference in December 2013, but which the award-holder was unable to take forward because of focusing on the monograph.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CFCB1012-61D0-42F1-AD6B-6B6477C9F78E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e1a779af3896.90300601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/CcU-iQ2L5RQ</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>015DABA8-747D-4EAA-92C2-4418D096A0A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Staline, Dimitrov et le culte de l'individu</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Monde(s)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/de45de8bb44d401206ad3a7925ec7449"><gtr:id>de45de8bb44d401206ad3a7925ec7449</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morgan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a73522e85bce8.62181391</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>80B2A4A2-4CAB-4DCB-9D28-DDFE8810D130</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tierras de nadie.
