Play programmes and other documents demonstrate that Ellen Terry was involved in numerous theatre productions, especially Shakespeare's plays and she gave lectures about Shakespeare in Britain, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database provides an online database to search this important theatre archive of over 20,000 documents. 
 This project, entitled 'Searching for Theatrical Ancestors' (STAR), therefore seeks to facilitate and enhance the use of this online database by family historians interested in the culturally and politically volatile period from the late nineteenth- to the twentieth centuries. Additional data will be provided about Lyceum Theatre productions 1878-1903 and Shakespeare productions, scenes and lectures 1910-21, hitherto only described in the database, by means of digitized and scanned, searchable images of play programmes (including cast lists and adverts). An improved interface will also provide new links to other online data sources such as census records, transatlantic passenger lists, googlemaps.
 The enhancement of the database and its interface will be piloted in a workshop, (drawn from the membership of those who advised on the original AHRC ETEC database) who will contribute their opinions during the pilot stage of the development of the enhancements to the website. The inclusion of representatives from the British Library and the National Trust will reflect the implications of the online database for users who wish to view the archival holdings at these institutions. Principally the selection of material for digitization is informed by the identified need of family history researchers to search on individuals' names. Theatrical tours made visible those individuals involved and their journey may be traced by means of passenger lists as well as play programmes. Therefore, where possible links will be included to other online resources. The project will generate new ways of thinking about family-theatre history, invigorating the use of archival resources and the demonstration of the enhanced resource at the public conference at the British Library during the Shakespeare exhibition in 2016 will ensure that it reaches a wide audience. The schedule of work is timed to ensure that feedback will be used both from the pilot test and the conference at the British Library. The timing of the conference to coincide with 'Shakespeare 400' in 2016 promises to attract the widest audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to improve access to the AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database for two principal groups of non-academic users. 

The first group is in the field of museum and heritage and specifically includes members of staff of the National Trust at Smallhythe Place, Tenterden, Kent, as well as volunteers and visitors who are seeking further information about Ellen Terry and her family. Ellen Terry purchased the late fifteenth-century property in 1899 and Terry's daughter, Edith Craig, handed the property and archive to the National Trust in 1939. Invitations to engage with the project will be extended to other relevant National Trust properties, such as Ayot St Lawrence (George Bernard Shaw) and other art galleries, such as the Watts Gallery (G. F. Watts), the National Portrait Gallery, the Garrick Club and Dimbola Lodge (Julia Margaret Cameron). 

The second group is in the field of family history and theatre history, ranging from individuals engaging in their own family history research to those involved in organisations such as Family History societies and centres, the Genealogical Society, the Society for Theatre Research.

A new and creative interactive interface with new search facilities, attractive to a new user group outside academia and accessing a selection of newly digitized theatre programmes, will enable this already valuable resource to engage in new ways with the public and the principal stakeholders, the British Library and the National Trust. The proposed enhancement to this existing online database catalogue of one of the UK's most significant theatre archives, of over 20,000 archival documents, will highlight the transatlantic and Antipodean theatre activities of Britain's most renowned performers of Shakespeare in the nineteenth century: Ellen Terry and Henry Irving.

The creation of an online digital world map of the productions of Shakespeare by the Lyceum Theatre company in London and on tour and of Ellen Terry's Shakespeare lectures in Australia, New Zealand and the UK in the period 1883-1915, will promote new international research collaborations as well as new, enjoyable means of learning about Shakespeare.

The principal enhancement proposed by the STAR project will be a digital map which will locate the productions geographically by means of a 'Shakespeare Train' icon, providing links to new contextual information designed for a general user group, including school students, adding value to the existing online resource. A second layer of information, suited especially to genealogists and academic user groups, will link the map to a selection of Shakespeare programmes described in the online database, to promote new engagement with the data through enhancing the geographical location of performances described in the archive.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>67730</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federation of Family History Societies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Federation of Family History Societies</gtr:description><gtr:id>5CDEDA34-6FA6-4759-9098-43C66FBB40C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has resulted in the wider awareness of the online resource with FFHS members.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c462f044aaa2.87811082-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The FFHS publicised the project conference, copyright workshop and the opportunities to give feedback on the online resource to its extensive membership of family history societies.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The FFHS were invited to give feedback on the enhancements to the online resource Searching for Theatrical Ancestors and to attend the project conference and copyright workshop.

Researching family histories is painstaking and important work. It opens up access to crucial information about our past and contributes to helping us understand why, how, who and when. But finding and interpreting the content is only one aspect. The researcher needs to understand the legalities, including the rights associated with the content - whether it is text, image, audio - in order to ensure that any publication of the content can be done legitimately. 
 
The workshop was run by leading copyright specialist, Naomi Korn, and explored some crucial issues for family historians in an accessible format. The discussions with delegates raised awareness in particular about issues relating to the use of photographs on websites and social media sites and the relevance of checking rights issues and the advisability of clear 'take-down' notices. Delegates found the guidance and worksheets particularly useful and said that they would use these in the future when researching the relevant rights issues and making decisions about using materials relating to their family history research. There were many myths and misunderstandings about copyright which were discussed and the workshop enabled the delegates to consider the complex aspects relating to rights in text and images relevant for their family history research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8261ae9d6f8.22611501</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.hull.ac.uk/fass/english/research/research-themes/modern-and-contemporary-lit/projects/ahrc-searching-for-theatrical.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>67730</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Searching for Theatrical Ancestors</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/N003438/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AA106553-9791-43C6-9515-6C2E0D16D05B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58989767da3e44.39587455</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The new Searching for Theatrical Ancestors resource has been used extensively by family history researchers, the intended new audience for this online resource. This is evidenced by Googleanalytics data indicating an increased usage of the online resource after the two launch events (conference at the British Library 29 July 2016 and copyright for family history researchers at the RSA, London on 7 September 2016) as outlined below. The enhancements to the online resource included a redesign to ensure that it works equally well on devices with different size screens including mobile devices. This redesign has been particularly successful as demonstrat in the analysis below. The two launch events were extensively advertised on social media and specifically promoted by the partner organisation, Federation of Family History Societies, to their membership. They were also publicised on Twitter by the account for BBC Who Do You Think You Are?, and the other two partner organisations, the British Library, National Trust at Smallhythe Place. Awareness of the online resource has also been raised by social media coverage on Twitter during #ancestryhour In the BBC Who Do You Think You Are? magazine, issue 121, Dec 2016 p. 24, the AHRC Searching for Theatrical Ancestors resource is listed as one of the 'top 50 websites to watch in 2017'. The BBC Who Do You Think You Are? annual event at the NEC Birmingham 6-8 April 2017 invited the AHRC Searching for Theatrical Ancestors project to have a stand. This is expected to extend its reach to the family history research community even further as 13,000 people are expected to attend the event.
 The AHRC Searching for Theatrical Ancestors online resource has provided an enhanced experience for the staff at the British Library and the National Trust's Smallhythe Place to assist them in responding to members of the public who are accessing the Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Archive. 
 The project conference at the British Library brought together invited speakers from leading theatre archives and libraries, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the online resource and facilitate discussions about the extension of the use of theatre archives by the general public.
 The copyright workshop, led by Naomi Korn, provided a further opportunity for fruitful discussion on the use of theatre archives for family history by the general public and the relevance of copyright issues. This collaboration has led to a development of new guidance for family history researchers which will be made available on the online resource in the near future.

A brief comparative analysis (using Googleanalytics) of the use of the online resource in the period since its launch (29 July 2016 to 14 March 2017) and the same period preceding the launch (13 December 2015 to 28 July 2016) shows:

1) The number of unique users and sessions (discrete periods when those users are looking at the site) has approximately doubled:

13-Dec-2015 - 28-Jul-2016: 943 users; 1,239 sessions
29-Jul-2016 - 14-Mar-2017: 1,846 users;2,455 sessions

2) The number of sessions from users in the UK has risen by 130% and represents over 66% of all sessions, an increase in share of 16%.

3) The number of page views has gone up by 70%

13-Dec-2015 - 28-Jul-2016: 4,789
29-Jul-2016 - 14-Mar-2017: 8,216

4) The bounce rate (percentage of visitors who just look at one page and then leave) has reduced

13-Dec-2015 - 28-Jul-2016: 66%
29-Jul-2016 - 14-Mar-2017: 50%

5) Mobile usage

The number of visitors using mobile phones has increased by 283% and
those using tablets by 125%

The case study on Ellen Terry on tour in Liverpool (delivered as an invited talk at a Symposium in the Central Library) identified unexpected evidence in play programmes other than the expected commercial advertisements. These play programmes included notices to inform the audience about the use of the venue itself and other leisure facilities nearby. The play programme described the behaviour of audience members. The theatre venue provided guidance in the play programme for audience members who were expecting telephone calls during the performance. Another play programme for a theatre on a pier, emphasised the facilities for bathers with the newly improved drainage near the seafront. These examples demonstrate the variety of information provided in play programmes which may be of use to economic and social historians and researchers interested in the history of the leisure and heritage industries as well as local history.

The search for freely available online datasets led to the discovery of the AHRC Reading Experience Database. This resource drew attention to the reading experiences mentioned in correspondence described on the AHRC Ellen Terry and Edith Craig Database and therefore identifies a new source of reading experiences. For the current project, the reading experiences of others (available on the AHRC RED) may provide family history researchers with useful contextualisation and points of comparison to help to understand the significance of references to reading in different periods of history.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The digitised Shakespeare play programmes which have been added to the online resource would be relevant for teachers to use to enhance the students' experience of studying Shakespeare and considering how, when and where Shakespeare's plays have been performed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The enhancements to this existing online database catalogue of one of the UK's most significant theatre archives, of over 20,000 archival documents, highlights the transatlantic and Antipodean theatre activities of Britain's most renowned performers of Shakespeare in the nineteenth century: Ellen Terry and Henry Irving.
