than amongst women in general. This study explores support for maternal and infant health in a range of ethnic and social groups. A new approach will be used to answer the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What is the nature and extent of social networks for maternal and child health In England and how are these shaped by ethnicity, religious identity, social class and gender?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What interventions to address barriers to maternal and child health are suggested by women who have experienced an infant mortality and how effectively can these be translated into practice?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The study will review current knowledge from existing literature and databases and from policymakers and practitioners. Sixty women from a range of backgrounds in two matched groups will also be interviewed - those who have (i) experienced an infant death (ii) a healthy child after 1 year. Interviews will explore the extent and nature of women's social networks for health and identify gaps in support. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Women interviewed will be supported to develop and test solutions that address the problems identified, using methods that model the structural change needed to reduce inequalities in health. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Two members of the Hope-Bradford group promoted diaries for parents with children on the neonatal unit as a way of capturing memories that would be particularly important if the child did not survive.

at the International Qualitative Health Research 2015 Conference in Toronto, Canada. This presented the findings from this study and two other related research projects led by researchers at the University of Alberta, Canada and the University of Sheffield, UK in order to identify general lessons for policy, practice and research methodology. Two bereaved women involved in the study were involved in the process of developing and delivering the presentation and the PI obtained funds for them to travel to Canada for this purpose. 

This symposium explored the opportunities and challenges of using participatory and other coproduction methods to understand inequalities in maternal and birth outcomes and stimulate action to reduce these. Common themes focused on the failure of policy directives and interventions to reach women who experience the worst health outcomes despite stated concern to reduce levels of maternal and infant mortality in various international settings, . The causes of the inequalities were highlighted as complex and contested and such women are most often perceived as the recipients of necessary support rather than key actors for the development of services and health interventions. The symposium presented methodological approaches that helped avoid naturalising and reproducing the inferior position given to women from marginalised groups and the unequal social relations that disadvantaged them in the UK and South Asia. Discussion of findings considered how these studies might contribute to development of a complex intervention to improve birth outcomes of cross national relevance. Time was allocated in the symposium for questions and discussion and the links developed led to work on a joint publication about participatory methods with a researcher at Iowa State University in the US.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dcb96f7fcbb2.25570852</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.iiqm.ualberta.ca/Conferences_and_Workshops/~/media/International%20Institute%20for%20Qualitative%20Methodology/QHR2015/Orals_IJQM.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Leeds IM Task Group 2012 Inequalities in Infant Mortality: perpetuated in policy and practice?

Emerging findings were presented from interviews with key informants as well as bereaved women from high risk groups, focussing on perceptions of social support from different professionals within maternity support networks.

Following the presentation I discussed with SANDS conference organisers the need to be more inclusive of women from higher risk groups in the national bereavement support groups offered by the charity. As a result the organisation began work to research the support needs of women from South Asian backgrounds and ran a focus group with women involved in our study. SANDS has since then established the 'Asian Outreach Project' at a number of sites across the UK to make their support more accessible to S Asian women and I have acted as a consultant for this activity. Bereaved women from our study have also put themselves forward for SANDS befriender training to support other women who experience an infant death as a result of being introduced to SANDS.

I also negotiated with conference organisers the possibility of bringing back study participants the following year to present research findings alongside the researchers. I subsequently arranged for 7 bereaved women to travel to Antrim, N Ireland in 2013 and 5 to travel to London in 2014 to present their stories at the national conference with travel expenses paid by SANDS and the Royal College of Midwives.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3235972377.69139242b1805ea</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LEEDS IM STRATEGY CONFERENCE 2011 Infant Mortaltiy and Social Networks - project overview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C865117-FD3A-4858-8C11-A4095B83F55A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation raised awareness of the study at the beginning of the project and enabled me to make links with key policymakers and practitioners at one of the sites

The establishment of HOPE project groups, made up of bereaved women at both sites, impacted on women's own views of themselves as well as on the policy and practice settings which they sought to influence. HOPE members were supported to make critical and effective use of the research evidence, with a view to using these insights in the development of solutions to reduce inequalities in infant mortality. These solutions were piloted, with researchers facilitating the engagement of relevant stakeholders, and supporting women to 'bridge' with key actors in maternal health networks to enhance service and policy effectiveness. 

The study methods modelled the social and structural change needed to reduce inequalities in health and determinants of health for this social group and this model has been promoted as a means of engaging with such maternity service users in our dissemination activities. Using innovative methods, we have helped enhance participants' capacity, knowledge and skills to engage with social issues on which they have an important contribution to make. For example, where opportunities arose to speak about the study findings (including women's ideas about solutions) such as radio interviews and conference presentations, researchers sought to involve women, who co-presented and linked their personal stories to broader findings from the study. Women's capacity to engage with such activity was supported through formal training in relevant skills, involvement fees, childcare, travel and subsistence costs, which would otherwise have acted as barriers for many participants who juggled childcare, work (often low paid) and other responsibilities with a desire to get involved in the project. The HOPE groups also provided support for emotional and mental wellbeing, which was inaccessible to women from voluntary sector sources, and facilitated access to a range of other resources and opportunities (see bulleted initiatives below). 

Study methods helped avoid naturalising and reproducing the inferior position given to socially marginalised groups to ensure that bereaved women were not perceived simply as the objects of study and could contribute effectively, particularly those who had limited English and did not understand professional systems. The HOPE groups promoted and modelled engagement methods that were acceptable to participants, relevant to their priorities, involved reciprocal and equal relationships and respected different knowledge frameworks involved in the process. These methods have demonstrated an empowering means of engaging maternity service users from socially excluded groups. The study has shown in practice that groups like HOPE are feasible and can have a considerable impact on service development. 

All the women involved in HOPE said they felt empowered as a result and recognised the increased influence of having a collective voice and being aligned with a credible partner. Initially this alignment was with the University of Leeds, however as the study progressed more alliances and partnerships were developed and some of these continue to offer support. Support for HOPE meetings to continue after the end of the study was offered by a Public Health working group on infant mortality in Leeds and by the National Childbirth Trust in Bradford.

Development of the HOPE groups has helped everyone involved in the participatory phase of the study reflect deeply on relationships influenced by social exclusion, in this case between healthcare professionals and women at highest risk of infant death. A wide spectrum of professional responses, ranging from enthusiastic engagement to hostility and attempts to undermine the study, were observed during the course of the research. Two workshops held in the final phase of the project were designed to attract and focus on responsive practitioners and policymakers; these workshops highlighted the transformational impact of the project through coproduction of knowledge and action by people coming together, listening to bereaved women and creatively working to address their concerns. It was heartening to see that a commissioner who had previously not been supportive of the study also attended this event and subsequently invited researchers to present at a policy meeting. This suggests that the momentum created by the study had made women's priorities more difficult to dismiss. Bereaved women's perspectives could sometimes be hard for professionals to hear, but those who most helpfully engaged with the HOPE groups focused on drawing out lessons and solutions rather than becoming defensive and taking criticism personally. 

Study findings discussed with health and social care professionals at HOPE meetings and dissemination activities have resulted in a number of local and national initiatives relating to maternity and birth outcomes including:

? An enhanced care pathway for health visitors targeting women at highest risk of infant death. The pathway involves early liaison between Midwifery, Health Visiting and GPs, relationship building, listening effectively to service users, support to access other services and routine language support. 
? Work by the Haamla BME maternity project in Leeds to systematically improve access to maternity services for women from minority ethnic communities through screening antenatal records. Previously access had relied on self referral or referral via health professionals and many women who could have benefitted from Haamla support were unaware of the project.
? Representation of HOPE members on the Maternity Service Liaison Committees at both sites, providing sustained opportunities for involvement in decision making and leading to a review of the way service users were involved at one of the sites 
? Establishment of a MSLC subgroup in Leeds to work on improvements to the Leeds Hospital Trust's bereavement support pathway 
? Changes to the way that national and local SANDS bereavement charity organisations engaged with women from minority ethnic communities and creation of the National SANDS Asian Outreach pilot project. The study PI was also asked for input to SANDS guidance documents on engaging with women from minority ethnic communities and on post mortem arrangements following death of an infant.
? Enrolment on SANDS befriender training of a number of HOPE group members interested in supporting other women who had experienced an infant death including one member who needed language support to access this
? Work by Public Health staff in Leeds on tailoring antenatal education for groups at highest risk of infant mortality through design of the Pregnancy, Birth and Beyond programme 
? Establishment of a Neonatal Service User Group at the Bradford Royal Infirmary, in association with BLISS, a national bereavement charity, as a result of HOPE meeting with a neonatal consulltant. BLISS has subsequently offered training and conference presentations opportunities to one group member, who was named as the hospital's Volunteer of the Year in 2014
? Promotion of parental diaries within the neonatal unit at one site based on findings about how valuable one member had found these at the time of her own bereavement. This parent has promoted the diaries to other Trusts and fundraised to ensure they are easily accessible and available in Urdu 
? Use of culturally appropriate resources from the national charity Children of Jannah, to provide bereavement support for Muslim parents in Bradford 
? Two HOPE group members have had articles relating to their experiences and activities published in online blogs, local newspapers and other publications
? Feedback from a SANDS/Royal College of Midwives conference in Northern Ireland and at development workshops at both sites at which HOPE members presented their personal experiences alongside the researchers, indicated a powerful impact on audience members that would influence their future practice. 
? Development of an accessible bereavement support group in Leeds by HOPE members trained through Child Bereavement UK/SANDS

Two research workshops at which women presented their narratives engaged powerfully with practitioners in ways that challenged existing stereotypes and negative attitudes. Outcomes included:

- pathway for women from Pakistani and African
Caribbean backgrounds based on models already
developed for teenage mothers
-?a joint training event for health visitors and midwives on
accessible/appropriate bereavement support
-? representation of group members at the Maternity
Services Liaison Committee and at a neonatal services
users' support group they initiated
-?group members receivedSands (Stillbirth and Neonatal
Death Society) bereavement support training and fed into the organisation's work on improving access for
minority ethnic parents
-? support for a group member in relation to safeguarding
has involved raising issues highlighted by her case with
commissioners, care providers and advocates
-? training/capacity development for group members has
included sessions on communication/media skills and
involvement in local and national dissemination activity. A
member of HOPE Leeds appeared on Radio 4's 'Woman's
Hour' and members of both groups will contribute to
local developmental workshops and a national Sands
conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56debc2e46a417.42666141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Hope groups</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics/ethics-case-studies/case-study-participatory-methods/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I have drawn on my work with the HOPE groups to develop teaching good practice for involving vulnerable participants in research without replicating social exclusion</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CC47FE1-DABD-4777-94DF-1912C1076600</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have taught Masters level students midwifery, nursing and dietetics students within formal programmes at the University of Leeds how to involve service users in their research, drawing on lessons from this study</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545bb1a0893a31.18557532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I have developed a Case Study for ESRC on participatory research as part of its materials on Research Ethics as guidance for other researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84BDC48B-64A5-4D07-A571-104ED3D2137E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ESRC investment managers have contacted all investments (including IAA and DTC Directors) to make them aware of the materials</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc397206d17.28879870</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory research case study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics/ethics-case-studies/case-study-participatory-methods/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6918E38-6B1A-4660-8D81-26B4A928994B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Support for Women at Highest Risk of Infant Death</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Science and Medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/485b6f13052be344e88674aed4e0cbf4"><gtr:id>485b6f13052be344e88674aed4e0cbf4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mir G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dcba8d074310.07089381</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>14ABC8A8-AA93-49E1-BB8D-2267E8C6B961</gtr:id><gtr:title>Obstacles to &amp;quot;race equality&amp;quot;
