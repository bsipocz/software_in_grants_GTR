One of these is for the dsRNA molecules to be 'edited' by specific enzymes referred to as Adenosine Deaminases that acts on RNA (ADARs). This type of dsRNA editing involves substitution of one type of residue (adenosine (A)) for another (inosine (I)). Moreover, dsRNA molecules can be 'hyper-edited' where up to 50% of A residues are changed to I. As the residues within a dsRNA molecule are arranged in a specific order to form a particular code, hyper-editing has the effect of disrupting this code. In addition, extensive substitution of A residues to I results in changing the shape of the dsRNA, with localized distortions occurring within edited regions. The change in shape that occurs within hyper-edited dsRNA makes it an easily recognizable molecule in the cell. Hyper-edited dsRNA (I-dsRNA) is specifically recognized and cleaved by an enzyme that is found in various cellular extracts (from humans, frogs). We previously showed that cleavage of I-dsRNA occurred within a particular configuration of residues that comprised both IU and UI pairs. In contrast, a similar dsRNA containing GU and UG pairs (G-dsRNA), which are essentially equivalent to IU and UI pairs, was neither recognized nor cleaved. This suggests that the enzyme responsible for cleaving I-dsRNA specifically recognizes its unique features. We have purified a protein that specifically recognizes I-dsRNA, and also promotes its cleavage. This protein, Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN), was previously described as a component of another major pathway in the cell involving dsRNA (RNAi). However, while TSN was able to enhance cleavage of I-dsRNA, it was not sufficient alone for cleavage. This suggested that other proteins were additionally required. We intend to identify the proteins that may play a role alongside TSN for specific cleavage of I-dsRNA. Following identification, we will investigate how these proteins interact with both TSN and I-dsRNA, and test whether they are involved in cleavage. In addition, we will carry out experiments aimed at understanding the differences in the shape of I-dsRNA, compared with G-dsRNA, that make it susceptible to cleavage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Long dsRNA in cells may undergo hyper-editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), whereby up to 50% of adenosine (A) residues are converted to inosine (I). Such extensive modification results in localized distortions of the RNA helix, as IU and UI pairs have a different geometry to Watson-Crick AU and UA base pairs. Hyper-editing by ADARs therefore effectively 'tags' the dsRNA for subsequent recognition by various proteins. Inosine-containing dsRNA (I-dsRNA) is specifically cleaved in various cytoplasmic extracts. In contrast, dsRNAs containing isosteric GU or UG pairs (G-dsRNA) is not cleaved. We propose that cleavage of I-dsRNA is important for disposal of hyper-edited viral dsRNA, or for other inappropriately edited cellular dsRNAs. Moreover, cleavage of I-dsRNA may be important for turning off the pathway whereby I-dsRNA acts to reduce gene expression. Previously we have shown that Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN), a component of RISC in the RNAi pathway, specifically binds to and enhances cleavage of I-dsRNA. Conversely, a specific inhibitor of staphylococcal nucleases (pdTp) inhibits cleavage. However, TSN alone is insufficient for cleavage of I-dsRNA. It is therefore likely that additional proteins are required; these may stabilize the binding of TSN to I-dsRNA, or regulate its activity. Alternatively, while the cleavage of I-dsRNA is consistent with TSN playing a direct role, we cannot rule out the possibility that TSN recruits another nuclease that specifically cleaves I-dsRNA. We aim to identify the co-factors of TSN that may be required for specific cleavage of I-dsRNA. We will subsequently characterize their interactions with both TSN and I-dsRNA, and to investigate their potential role in cleaving I-dsRNA. We will also carry out experiments to elucidate the structures of both I- and G-dsRNA, in order to determine why I-dsRNA is uniquely susceptible to cleavage.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279779</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Summer school laboratory exercises</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F07A88BC-FF5C-4BA8-9B75-5E2461545042</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a workshop for year 12 pupils to enable them to get some hands on experience in the lab.

Double stranded RNA undergoes significant editing by ADARs (Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA), which generates Inosine-containing dsRNA (IU-dsRNA). We anticipate that IU-dsRNA is readily recognizable in cells due as the introduction of IU pairs is likely to result in characteristic distortions within the RNA helix. We have previously demonstrated that IU-dsRNA interacts with specific protein complexes in lysates prepared from either mammalian cells or Xenopus oocytes. We have now further characterized the protein complex that binds IU-dsRNA. We have thus demonstrated that Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (TSN) interacts with IU-dsRNA, and also interacts directly with components of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). We have subsequently shown that TSN specifically localizes to SGs during either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. We have thereby shown that SG is a novel component of cytoplasmic SGs. 
2. We have shown that the interferon-inducible cytoplasmic isoform of ADAR1 (ADAR1p150) is a novel component of the protein complex that specifically binds IU-dsRNA. Moreover, we have shown that ADAR1p150 localizes to cytoplasmic SGs after treating cells with various stresses (E.g. oxidative stress, interferon-induced stress, heat-shock). This unexpected finding is exciting in view of other data that has suggested that ADAR1p150 plays an important role in various stress pathways in mammalian cells, and is essential for viability. 
3. We investigated the localization of ADAR1p150 to SGs in mammalian cells. We have thus shown that the Z-DNA binding domain (ZaADAR1) exclusively found in ADAR1p150 is necessary and sufficient for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we showed that fusion of the ZaADAR1 domain (~75 amino acids) to either GFP or polypyrimidine binding protein 4 (PTB4) also resulted in their localization to stress granules. We additionally show that the Za domain from other Z-DNA binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we showed that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization. 
These unexpected observations raise some intriguing questions as to why Z-RNA should be utilized to localize proteins containing Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding domains to stress granules. Further studies will be therefore be key to fully understanding how these proteins contribute to the immune response in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, our findings describe a hitherto unknown function for Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding domains.
4. We have used classical chromatography methods to purify the nuclease activity that specifically targets IU-dsRNA from HeLa cell lysates. However, whilst this analysis yielded only a few candidate protein bands that correlated with the nuclease activity, as determined by SDS-PAGE, we were unable to specifically correlate any of them with the nuclease activity following analysis by mass spectrometry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings made during the course of this grant are significant within various research areas, including RNA editing, stress granules, and innate immunity. Moreover, the observations we have made have already contributed to further important research in each of these areas. In particular, there is an enormous amount of interest regarding the observation that ADAR1p150 is essential for the viability of mammalian cells, and to understand the role of ADAR1p150 in immune pathways. The observation that ADAR1p150 is a component of SGs, which play an important role during stress responses in mammalian cells, will therefore be further investigated in order to gain insights into the role of ADAR1p150 for cellular survival following stress.

The observation that Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding domains are important for localization to SGs will be explored further. These domains are only found in a handful of proteins, all of which have been implicated in immune pathways. It will therefore be intriguing to explore the potential relationship between these Z-DNA/Z-RNA containing proteins in the broader context of innate immunity, and the role of the Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding domain for localization to SGs during stress.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8BDAF85C-926F-468F-A091-1BBE07A5004B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf2528c34710.40260968</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AFF53C84-1350-4DF3-9685-51422E0B070F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c64d4540ad097df0fbd66b1429f48e95"><gtr:id>c64d4540ad097df0fbd66b1429f48e95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ng SK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675d8bf02024</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4891B644-CA81-46A4-8DD1-092345C95EDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tudor-SN and ADAR1 are components of cytoplasmic stress granules.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>RNA (New York, N.Y.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e235fc9169ece437fe9ded7f2e1b9f77"><gtr:id>e235fc9169ece437fe9ded7f2e1b9f77</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weissbach R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1355-8382</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56ccc62a16d686.98739194</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F018347/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
