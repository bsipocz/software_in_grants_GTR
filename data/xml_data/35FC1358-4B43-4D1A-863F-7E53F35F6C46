Exploring the uptake of cycling to work through an agent-based model focusing on social interactions and social norms</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K004549/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This study will create a model to improve understanding about how a step-change in cycle commuting in the UK could be achieved. Cycling could bring a number of benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously improving population health and well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cycle commuting varies substantially within the UK, with cycling increasing in some areas. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions. Social science can direct attention to how locally specific cultures, identities, and changing social processes, shape commuting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Agent based models (ABM) have been used to show how complex and recognisable social systems can be generated from small scale interactions. In ABM agents, usually individual people, behave according to specified rules but can also learn through interaction and change how they respond to policies and events.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will use qualitative studies to develop rules around how people make commuting choices. The model will be set-up for three English urban areas:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Chester&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Bristol&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Cambridge. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The agents will be diverse in demographics and attitudes. Data from quantitative studies will be used to represent these populations and test the model?s predictions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will generate multiple Research Councils UK-identified economic and societal impacts:
-Improving health and well-being
-Evidence based policy making and influencing public policies
-Enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of organisations
-Environmental sustainability, protection and impact
-Increasing public engagement with research and related societal issues
 
We have identified the following impact objectives to achieve these:
1. Build awareness of the project among practitioners and policy-makers whose work involves or is affected by transport modelling
2. Make transport modelling more pluralistic by using an innovative approach starting from social interactions
3. Contribute to a new generation of transport modelling focused on transition and achieving shift to active and sustainable modes
4. Build knowledge among 'behaviour change' practitioners about how socio-cultural factors shape responses to interventions

Immediate beneficiaries fall into two groups:
1. Policy-makers and practitioners who use, or whose activities are affected by, transport modelling 
2. Practitioners interested in how our project can contribute to travel planning and behaviour change initiatives, particularly at a workplace level.

Increasing cycling could bring substantial population health benefits, reducing the burden of diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and depression. Modal shift away from motorised transport can bring multiple environmental benefits (e.g. reducing local air and noise pollution). Increasing understanding of how a step-change in cycling could occur will generate significant benefits for those with responsibility for public health (including now Local Authorities) and environmental sustainability.

Our research can increase the effectiveness of public services and policy at a local and national level. Our first core user group centrally includes transport planners and engineers, and also groups such as public health professionals seeking to promote active travel and policy-makers with responsibility for meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets. DEFRA and DfT have expressed interest in our research (particularly our development of the Sustainable Lifestyles Framework to explore social factors shaping behaviour change). 

Many within this user group recognise the limitations of traditional transport modelling approaches for addressing questions of transition and transport modal shift. We seek to build awareness of alternative and emerging approaches to modelling that encourage and enable progress towards such objectives. Our approach brings to the foreground social interactions and cultural change, and how these shape follow-on and longer-term effects of policy. This focus is in line with ongoing shifts within academic modelling, but as of yet has had limited practical impact on policy. Therefore, our second objective is to provide an example of an alternative approach that can be used to inform policy.

Our second key user group includes employers seeking to reduce their carbon footprint, and deciding upon travel plans, and considering how to evaluate these plans. Beyond the individual employer are local organisations promoting sustainable travel such as the Cambridgeshire Travel for Work Partnership (also a data provider). This organisation and others like it will benefit from the development of knowledge about interventions and behaviour change. 

For similar reasons the research is relevant to cycling industries, including the growing number of organisations planning delivery of cycling infrastructure or training (e.g. Sustrans, Cycle Training UK) and other 'soft measures' (such as 'travel champions' at work). In developing interventions and their own business plans, these organisations can learn from our examination of how behaviour change is affected by context, shaped by interpersonal interactions, and how it might dissipate or continue over time.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>167895</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen's University Belfast</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ruth Hunter NIHR fellow advisory board</gtr:description><gtr:id>C56BB836-D96F-4CF7-BFE9-C8613E0CD230</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New partnership.

The first two relate to our re-analysis of quantitative and qualitative data as part of the project. The quantitative data re-analysed is from Census 2001 and 2011, while the qualitative data re-analysed came from three research projects (Cycling Cultures, Cycling Cities and Towns Qualitative Data, and Commuting and Health in Cambridge). One of our published papers has been accessed thousands of times already this year, while the website for the project has had 1,380 unique visits to date, and generated contacts from interested policy-makers.

1) Our findings that increases in cycling in England and Wales did not lead to increased equity in cycling have helped shift policy approaches, leading to a greater acceptance that (i) infrastructure standards need to be higher and (ii) there is a need to specifically study and target the needs of currently under-represented groups.

The analysis has been presented at practitioner conferences (e.g. Hackney Cycling Conference 2014, London Cycling Show 2015). This has led to Rachel Aldred being contacted by practitioners and increased interest expressed in addressing issues around cycling and diversity (for example, input into London Borough Cycling Strategies).


The paper is the 4th most read (online) Transport Reviews article with 3453 views, and an Altmetric score of 121. It has also been cited by TfL in presentations (for example, to London Cycling Show 2015). The work was presented to a DfT analysts' seminar in 2015 and to Transport for London.
2) Our analysis of safety gear and the normalisation of cycling have contributed to a changing policy debate on how to market cycling. Many authorities including Transport for London and Bristol City Council now use a much more diverse range of images (people and clothing) and TfL now has a specific strand of work on 'normalising cycling'.

We presented this work at the Public Health England Conference in 2014. Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents expressed interest in relation to the development of their policy on cycle helmets and we sent them an advance copy of the paper. Through the Centre for Science and Policy framework results were also presented to Jessica Matthew (Deputy Director, Road User Licensing, Insurance and Safety, Department for Transport).

3) The research and academic team have developed experience and relationships with policy makers that have contributed to the development of three related projects that are closely aligned to policy.
These are, 'The National Propensity to Cycle Tool (NPCT)', 'A microsimulation model of the Health Checks programme' (Health Checks), and 'The Near Miss Project'.

The NPCT study (funded by the Department for Transport) is led by Dr James Woodcock with Dr Rachel Aldred as co-investigator. The project is developing a tool for national and regional transport planner to support decisions on where to invest in cycling; a prototype is available here www.pct.bike and the related www.pct.bike/ICT The project is high impact, and the prototype model resulted in the team being awarded second place in the London Cycling Design Awards for technical innovation in 2015. The models for this project are available under an open source licence. Version 1 of the full model covering all local authorities in England will be available from June 2016. Ali Abbas, researcher on the Changing Commutes project has contributed to the development of this project.

Parts of the spatial microsimulation methods used in the NPCT were, in particular the 'flow allocation' method, developed for the Changing Commutes project. The Changing Commutes project directly supported a collaboration with Cambridgeshire County Council in which we fed in to their Transport Joint Strategic Needs Analysis. 

The wider work of the NPCT has led to interest from multiple regional transport planning authorities, and a further EPSRC Impact Acceleration Grant to work with Transport for Greater Manchester. We are also discussing using the NPCT to support the new Cycling Walking and Investment Strategy. 

The Health Checks study, led by Dr James Woodcock, is funded by Public Health England. In the project we are developing an individual level model of the Health Checks Programme. The longitudinal simulation of individuals has benefited from the approach used in the Changing Commutes model. The model will be made available to health planner and the wider public with open source code in early 2016. 

The Near Miss Project, led by Dr Rachel Aldred, is funded by the Knowledge Exchange Hub, Creative Exchange and the SME, Blaze. It explores cyclists' experience of near miss or non-injury incidents, and has been the first study to calculate a per-mile non-injury incident rate for UK cyclists. This is a project with high impact, which has just been funded for a second year. It has already led to two journal articles (one published, one under second stage peer review) and a high profile report and stakeholder launch event.

Dr Rachel Aldred has also been invited to join (and speak at an upcoming event for) the TfL Economic Case for Cycling Working Group with representatives from business, DfT, boroughs etc. One aim of this group is to collect, generate and disseminated evidence around the broader economic impact of cycling schemes.

Ongoing work
Papers related to the Changing Commutes project are still in preparation and further outputs are expected in 2016. 

Challenges
Various challenges had to be faced during the project. Two important secondary data sources that we reasonably expected to be able to access were not available. Firstly, and most significantly, the Cycling City and Towns baseline data was withdrawn by the Department for Transport due to problems with the data. The reasons for withdrawal were not immediately made clear and Dr Woodcock invested considerable time, over approximately nine months, trying to get hold of the update data which was to be released but has in fact not been released. The data would have provided detailed individual level travel and attitudinal data for our three intended settings. Although the Cycling City and Towns qualitative data was not affected by the same problems additional time was taken to access the data due to heightened concerns following the problems with the quantitative data. A second data set was from Bristol where detailed data on travel to work had been collected and was promised to the team. However, despite repeated requests to provide the data, changing personnel and priorities at Bristol City Council meant that in the end the data was not provided. 

In summary
Our models and findings have been presented at multiple conferences and meetings to a range of audiences including academics, practitioners, and policy makers. Impacts have begun to change policy specifically around the cultural 'normalisation' of cycling and the approach taken to achieving a more equitable age and gender balance in cycling.

We anticipate further impact as further papers are published and disseminated during 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9EC0C72A-658F-42E5-9E3C-6CE7A82887F3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545134551e1f25.44574770</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>What have you discovered or developed through the research funded on this grant?

The Changing Commutes project's findings at this point can be described under three main areas. The first two relate to our re-analysis of quantitative and qualitative data as part of the project. The quantitative data re-analysed is from Census 2001 and 2011, while the qualitative data re-analysed came from three research projects (Cycling Cultures, Cycling Cities and Towns Qualitative Data, and Commuting and Health in Cambridge). One of our published papers has been accessed thousands of times already this year. Future findings will be forthcoming through 2016.
1) Our first finding is that in areas in the UK where cycling has increased gender equity has not improved, and age inequalities have marginally widened:
In low-cycling countries, cycling is not evenly distributed across genders and age groups. In the UK, men are twice as likely as women to cycle to work and cycling tends to be dominated by younger adults. By contrast, in higher cycling countries and cities, gender differences are low or absent. Such places also lack the UK's steady decline in cycling among those aged over 35 years. Over the past fifteen years some UK local areas have seen increases in cycling. We analysed data from the English and Welsh Census 2001 and 2011 to examine whether such increases are associated with greater diversity among cyclists. We found that in areas where cycling has increased, there has been no increase in the representation of females, and a decrease in the representation of older adults. Creating a mass cycling culture may require deliberately targeting infrastructure and policies towards currently under-represented groups.
2) Our second finding is that use of safety clothing is described as primarily motivated by perceived motor traffic danger. There is substantial pressure on cyclists to wear safety clothing, although many are reluctant and even resistant. Policy-makers should consider carefully the role of safety clothing within a transition to a safer, high-cycling culture.
This qualitative research contributes to debates around cycle safety clothing, specifically helmets and high-visibility clothing. In England such items are widely promoted in safety campaigns and in broader cycling publicity, particularly for children. However, the impact of this approach on cycling safety and cycling uptake is unclear and contested. This article uses a combined analysis of three sets of qualitative interview data to explore talk about cycle helmets and high-visibility clothing. 
Reported use of safety clothing was strongly associated with perceived threat from motor vehicles, but accompanied by scepticism about effectiveness. Many interviewees felt and/or exerted social pressure to wear a helmet, and, to a lesser extent, high-visibility clothing. Analysis identified a widespread dislike of safety clothing, sometimes linked to talk about cycling less because of the perceived need to wear such clothing. We found evidence of resistance to social pressure, expressed by complaining about inconvenience, discomfort (helmets), and personal appearance.
Our findings suggest that policy-makers and practitioners should carefully consider how promoting safety clothing might impact cycling uptake and experiences. Policy goals of increasing cycling and making it more 'normal' and subjectively safer might imply reducing or even avoiding the use of such accessories in everyday utility cycling contexts, and relying on alternative strategies to improve cycling safety.

3) The research and academic team have developed methods, skills, and expertise in the project that have then been applied in further projects. These are, 'The National Propensity to Cycle Tool (NPCT)', 'A microsimulation model of the Health Checks programme' (Health Checks), and 'The Near Miss Project'.
The NPCT study (funded by the Department for Transport) is led by Dr James Woodcock with Dr Rachel Aldred as co-investigator. The project is developing a tool for national and regional transport planner to support decisions on where to invest in cycling; a prototype is available here www.pct.bike and the related impacts of cycling tool is available at www.pct.bike/ICT The project is high impact, and the prototype model resulted in the team being awarded second place in the London Cycling Design Awards for technical innovation in 2015. The models for this project are available under an open source licence. Version 1 of the full model covering all local authorities in England will be available from July 2016. Ali Abbas, researcher on the Changing Commutes project has contributed to the development of this project.
Parts of the spatial microsimulation methods used in the NPCT were, in particular the 'flow allocation' method, developed for the Changing Commutes project. 
The Health Checks study, led by Dr James Woodcock, is funded by Public Health England. In the project we are developing an individual level model of the Health Checks Programme. The longitudinal simulation of individuals has benefited from the approach used in the Changing Commutes model. The model will be made available to health planner and the wider public with open source code in late 2016. 
The Near Miss Project, led by Dr Rachel Aldred, is funded by the Knowledge Exchange Hub, Creative Exchange and the SME, Blaze. It explores cyclists' experience of near miss or non-injury incidents, and has been the first study to calculate a per-mile non-injury incident rate for UK cyclists. This is a project with high impact, which has just been funded for a second year. It has already led to two journal articles (one published, one under second stage peer review) and a high profile report and stakeholder launch event.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings feed into debates on promotion of cycling safety equipment.
