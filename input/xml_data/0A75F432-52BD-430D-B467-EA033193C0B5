Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K007610/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Despite funding being available for ?place-making? ie the implementation/ creation of open spaces, the long term management - or ?place-keeping? - of these spaces is often neglected and initial benefits may be lost over time. In addition, the economic recession has led to severe budget cuts to green space management as it is a non-statutory service.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to examine the extent to which cross-sector partnerships are effective in managing green spaces.There is a long history of public, private, third sector organisations and community stakeholders getting involved in managing and maintaining green spaces. However, we do not know how well cross-sector partnerships deliver good green space management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To address this gap in knowledge, this project aims to develop and apply their partnership capacity approach as a method of place-keeping evaluation in the city of Sheffield.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working closely with project partners (Sheffield City Council, Green Estate, Sheffield Wildlife Trust and Tinder Foundation), the project team will conduct interviews, workshops and hold a large-scale event. The project website will be a key dissemination tool with blogs and ongoing discussions at the forthcoming&amp;nbsp;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;> www.place-keeping.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this knowledge exchange project?
Alongside the project partners, the following beneficiaries will be interested in, and benefit directly from, the project's focus on place-keeping:
Public sector including Sheffield City Council departments (particularly Parks and Countryside, Planning, Roads and Transport) and Core City councils (including Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham); and at a local level, Community Assemblies in Sheffield;
Private sector including contractors employed (e.g. by councils) to engage in place-keeping activities (such as maintenance of verges and tree management); businesses using green space volunteering within corporate social responsibility programmes, and interested in active engagement in place-keeping in green space (e.g. through sponsorship);
Third sector including organisations engaged in green space management including social enterprises, contracting organisations and trusts, who may rely on volunteers to deliver place-keeping activities on the ground;
Community groups including Friends groups, Tenants and Residents Associations, sports groups whose are engaged in place-keeping activities within green spaces such as parks and residential areas;
The wider public who use green spaces in Sheffield (and beyond Sheffield in the Core Cities) will benefit indirectly from this project.
How will they benefit?
This project will contribute directly to increasing cross-sector capacity in Sheffield to deliver place-keeping in times of economic constraint. This project uses innovative research methods to explore how place-keeping happens in partnership, fully involving public, private, third sectors and community group users and beneficiaries. The project's focus on cross-sector partnerships has not been explored before in relation to green space management, and has been highlighted by practitioners, who participated in the recent 'Place-making and place-keeping' conference, as an important gap in their knowledge. This project builds on this conference held in Sheffield (July 2012) by using findings and contributions from participants to inform the collaborative development of this project. The project provides cross-sector users and beneficiaries with the valuable opportunity to come together to reflect on individual and collective contributions to partnerships, and see how place-keeping knowledge and information flows between/ among different practitioners, and identify the gaps and barriers to good communication. With place-keeping as the linchpin of this project, and the university as non-partisan facilitator, the project will provide an innovative forum for cross-sector users and beneficiaries to come together and share their knowledge collaboratively in an inclusive environment. Participating in the project workshops/ event and making use of the resources made publicly available on the project website means that users and beneficiaries will have the opportunity to improve their working practices through better communication and sustained knowledge exchange. This will help contribute to better decision-making about use of scarce resources and ultimately contribute to benefiting the wider public by improving place-keeping activities on the ground. In addition, using digital media will help reach a wider range of people such as younger people who may not currently be active in (or aware of) place-keeping. The final event will be a high-profile event aimed at keeping place-keeping on the political agenda by ensuring the involvement of policymakers from Sheffield, members of the Core Cities group and other place-keeping practitioners and professionals around the UK. Users and beneficiaries will continue to benefit from this project beyond the one year timescale as the website will be active for much longer, and the team will develop findings to develop new project proposals and produce articles in practitioner-focused journals/ outlets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>42226</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Wildlife Trusts</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sheffield Wildlife Trust</gtr:department><gtr:description>Ongoing collaboration with Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust (SWT)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D888D3F-73FC-4D83-A65A-27473D9EEF1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are developing ongoing networks in the Sheffield area in close collaboration with SWT, one of which is the Waterways heritage group (see separate entry).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c65f5f137890.35555321-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>SWT are non-governmental practitioners based in the Sheffield area.

Our research activity has led to us being invited to advise council and national government on parks management matters. This includes our participation in a National Green Spaces workshop for invited experts only which was hosted by the Department for Communities and Local Government about long-term green/ open space management, February 2015. 

The place-keeping team are members of the Sheffield Green Infrastructure cross-sector Consortium, led by Sheffield Wildlife Trust (established 2014), - a cross-sector group to identify how green spaces are managed and promoted across the city in a sustainable and integrated way.

We are members of the Rethinking Parks group - led by Sheffield City Council (SCC) (representatives from Planning, Sheffield Housing Company, Parks &amp;amp; Countryside) and the social enterprise Green Estate. The group is identifying new ways of managing economically sustainable parks to bring added societal and environmental benefits to Sheffield's residents.

With Sheffield City Council (SCC), we have been facilitating a Sheffield-wide Friends of Parks groups - which is now a constituted group called the Sheffield Green Spaces Forum which is a self-supporting group for the SCC and a voice in the changing management of parks debate. In this way, our research findings have helped direct how SCC work with community groups in face of austerity. 

Place-keeping is being used as a term of reference by the international firm, the Grosvenor Group. An email from Andrew Maskell, Head of Landscape Management, 7th May 2015, stated &amp;quot;I really like your work on Placekeeping - as a Landscape Manager I am passionate about the Placekeeping element and found your website really usefulThe London Estate has just launched a new Placemaking Department, with a new Director etc, lots of emphasis has been placed on the Making and I'm keen to shout about the Keeping.I feel your knowledge could really assist us going forward&amp;quot;). 

Recent invited guest speaking includes the sold-out Royal Society of Arts 'Psychology of Home' event in Burlington House, London (April 2015), the AECB network Annual Conference with a paper on 'Place-keeping at a community level' (2015 - AECB is a UK network of companies with the common aim of promoting sustainable building). 

Since 2013, I have co-hosted an in Sheffield for non-academics and academics to discuss the challenges of long-term management in practice, with on average 80 attendees. This has been co-sponsored with Sheffield City Council, Green Estate, and South Yorkshire Forest Partnership. Our next high-profile, national and free place-keeping event will be co-sponsored by Nesta and the Land Trust in January 2016.

The place-keeping team has continued to be invited to do radio appearances, with the city's radio station Sheffield Live, including one on 14 May 2015 about 'Urban Agriculture in our cities?'

We are also working closely with Sheffield City Council in a collaboration around teaching and research in specific areas of the city where green infrastructure are in need of examination. Our students are able to provide site analysis, designs and management plans for the council in collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>91CD3FFF-A1E9-49F2-85C1-064D774D0209</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55deec58992c95.86803098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project aimed to develop and apply a particular research method - the partnership capacity approach - as a place-keeping evaluation tool in collaboration with a range of stakeholder organisations involved in green space management in the city of Sheffield. The project applied this approach to partnerships in two areas of the city of Sheffield. We applied the approach to two partnerships in Sheffield. In one, a partnership was developed in the early 2000s to deal with the fragmented and ineffective green space management processes to a more joined-up and coordinated approach. Alongside this, significant funding was made available to improve green space and involve communities - all in all, ingredients for a successful partnership. Our analysis showed that this was far from the truth. The second area for the research approach was proposed by our Advisory Group of non-academic partners. This was a neither affluent nor deprived area of Sheffield which has lots of green space, but little funding, input, or real interest in the area in relation to its green space management.
The partnership capacity analysis was applied alongside the dimensions of place-keeping because the issues that emerged in both instances were not partnership-specific but related more broadly to issues of governance, evaluation, funding, policy and design/ maintenance. We conducted 15 interviews with stakeholders in the public, community and voluntary sectors about partnership working and feedback from with the Advisoy Group. Our main findings are fourfold, with the underlying message that partnerships for place-keeping don't work without a number of factors in place. Firstly, there needs to be a willingness to change to challenge the following perceptions held by organisations: fear of change, inflexible/ entrenched culture, perceived loss of power, priorities held by stakeholders, and, inflexible decision-making processes. Secondly we found that partnerships need the power to change, to challenge existing decision-making processes. In essence this is about challenging who makes the decisions, why and how they make the decisions, and with what information. Thirdly, effective partnerships need effective decision-making structures to challenge individuals who are hugely important but may have own agenda, the amount of time wasted and also the poor channels of communication across stakeholders and to the wider public. Finally, partnerships need flexible and effective resources to challenge the status quo, the scope and time restrictions of funding programmes, the amount of money spent in 'the wrong way' and 'on the wrong things', and lastly, the loss of skills and knowledge. 
The current economic situation with public sector budgets cuts and limited resources, can drive innovation, force change and break down power relations, and our analysis shows how this is happening in Sheffield. However, without the willingness to change, this will be very difficult to achieve in a meaningful manner which has the scope for long-term and effective partnerships.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our collaborative role in this project puts us in the unique position to act as a mediator and apolitical friend to bring together cross-sector stakeholders together in matters of landscape design, planning and management in Sheffield. We currently facilitate the Sheffield Green Space Forum which brings together Friends Groups (with representation from Sheffield City Council) from across the city to form a group which promotes and safeguards Sheffield's green and open spaces, and builds a partnership to share best practice, skills, talent and experience. This is an ongoing endeavour which is a direct result of the work we have been doing on this project. The group has recently affiliated to the National Federation of Green Spaces. 
The follow-up workshop which we secured funding was via the ESRC Festival of Social Sciences and was a successful event (7 November 2014) open to Friends groups and other community organisations. It was also attended by a number of Sheffield City Council officers and environmental enterprise staff. This provided an opportunity for delegates to explore online communication tools in a safe and relaxed environment which was hands-on and practical for people to 'have a go'. This has led to a number of Friends Groups now having active Twitter and Facebook accounts. 
We have created a place-keeping partnership toolkit which will be available in the new year, hard copies of which we will distribute to community groups in Sheffield, and we will make digital copies available to all groups online and promoted to wider audience (outside Sheffield) through our website and twitter. This will provide advice which emerges as a direct result from the project findings to help partnerships work effectively and efficiently, while acknowledging the challenges and barriers to partnership working to deliver place-keeping. 
The project has consolidated working with key advisory group partners, Sheffield City Council and Green Estate Company and the Place-keeping Group has been invited to contribute to several partnership initiatives that are exploring alternative approaches to green space management including the Sheffield Green Consortium (public, private and third sector city-wide partnership), Endowing Parks in the 21st Century led by the National Trust (public, private, third sector) and Re-thinking Parks, led by Nesta (Sheffield City Council/third-sector).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>700B0F96-8791-4C8C-8C2F-138E63D8623C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55deffd9f0a5c2.11094376</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.place-keeping.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to and attendance at DCLG Green Spaces Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72A9FC66-0C6E-4074-BE4A-0294327C7433</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6b1be177484.04863052</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence given: House of Lords Design Commission Inquiry</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD12921F-4F0B-4250-AC6A-9CBC5DCFF2AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6aee4405349.19721482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to act as 'Challenger' on the Grosvenor Green Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67ED38DA-048E-4088-A104-8FA8808709AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Grosvenor have directly incorporated the place-keeping research into their Green Strategy for all their assets in the London area. This text below was taken from an email dated 28.06.2016:

&amp;quot;The Green Estate Strategy incorporates three elements:
 
1. Placeshaping - A master plan identifying opportunities to enhance urban ecology and create a constellation of exemplary connected green space,
2. Placekeeping - A green infrastructure toolkit incorporating a Landscape Management Plan, Tree Strategy and estate wide habitat management guidance,
3. Place living - A Living spaces blueprint setting out how high quality green spaces will help to animate the estate through community interaction; connecting people to nature as well as promoting a healthy environment.
 
As a summary our future vision would be: Mayfair and Belgravia are two of the greenest neighbourhoods in central London. The Estate is characterised by thriving trees, planting and high quality open spaces. This has been achieved by adopting a long-term approach and through planning on a district-wide scale. The Estate's natural environment is cherished by residents and visitors, complementing its exceptional buildings. There are large green spaces open for public use, providing a focal point for neighbourhood activity. The Estate has become a beacon of environmental excellence. It has a network of green corridors including pocket parks, rain gardens, green walls and green roofs, using the natural environment to enrich local ecology and enhance the experience of the Estate&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c65d1f8e4ab4.23328440</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is a framework within which the capacity of partnerships can be assessed.
