For example, atherosclerosis and aneurysms are cardiovascular diseases, where the arterial wall suffers local changes in stiffness and strength (i.e., the ability to withstand a load without failing). Under the pressure exerted by the pulsatile blood flow, the weakened tissues are vulnerable to ruptures. The dramatic pathological consequences of these events notably contribute to making cardiovascular diseases the second cause of death in the UK, just below cancer. It is clear that underpinning the mechanical basis of the failures is essential for their prevention and timely treatment.

Quantifying the mechanics of soft tissues is thus a necessary assessment for clinicians, but also for engineers, scientists and industry in the healthcare sector. Methods to measure tissue properties are therefore in high demand. Yet, most current in vitro techniques are not standardised, and fall short of some important features. First, they are often unreliable: soft tissues are hard to handle and to mount on an instrument, and end up being misaligned or deteriorated during the measurements. Second, they generally require large specimens, and the many localised changes in properties of inhomogeneous tissues are irremediably averaged throughout and cannot be measured. And third, the methods are rarely fit to measure tissue properties under the dynamic loads met in real physiological conditions.

This research programme develops a new in-vitro technique that addresses these issues. First, we develop a protocol to precisely excise small, millimetre-scale specimens of tissues with well-controlled dimensions. Second, we implement an instrument that can reliably and precisely measure the mechanical properties of these small specimens. The instrument is compact enough to be installed on a microscope and further observe the microstructure of the tissues while the measurements are performed. Our new technique relies on two innovative features: first, a set of press-punch tools are used to simultaneously excise, align and attach the specimen to the apparatus using minimally invasive chemical adhesive; second, the sensors of the instrument use a fast, accurate and computer-controlled electromagnetic technology. Our instrument (diagrams, part numbers or 3D-printing files, etc.), the protocol, and associated software will further be made freely available as open-source. That way, we hope to reach researchers from more disciplines, such as tissue engineering, biophysics, or the emerging field of mechanobiology, but also in subjects outside the biomechanics arena.

The second step of the programme is to measure the mechanical properties of human atherosclerotic and aneurysmal tissues. These measurements will fully exploit the combined benefit of our new technique, to provide, for the first time, a map of stiffness and strength values in the diseased arteries under dynamic loading. This data will then be employed to perform numerical simulations that can explain the mechanical conditions triggering tissue rupture events. These findings will undoubtedly help clinicians, researchers and industry to improve treatments and optimise physical interventions, such as surgery and angioplasty (stents). Our project provides a strong contribution to addressing some of the &amp;quot;Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenges&amp;quot;, indeed flagged as an important research priority by the EPSRC.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The instrument developed in this project and its first applications will primarily benefit healthcare professionals. Our technique indeed underpins our understanding of diseases' physical basis, and provides the data to invent or improve healthcare technologies. In the long term, however, our instrument may have a much broader impact in a range of other sectors.

Public health:

One of the main beneficiaries of our research will be the healthcare sector. The end-users most directly impacted by our technology are the professionals animating this field. Injury and trauma, aging of tissues, lesion elastography, surgical simulators, regenerative medicine, implant and prosthesis, or biomedical devices are all clinical frameworks that encompass both practitioners and industries, and where tissue mechanics play a prominent role. 
Cardiovascular diseases are another typical example where pathologies are closely related to a mechanical context that is central in treatment strategies. Cardiovascular diseases are the second cause of death in the UK, and a major socio-economic burden for the country. Their angioplastic repair requires both the surgeons and the stent manufacturers to know the mechanical properties of the diseased artery. This particular point will be one of the focusses of the project, whose output may indeed have a direct impact in improving these interventions. Our findings will be readily shared with our relevant contacts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Using a different angle to improve the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the collaborator for this proposal recently created the start-up &amp;quot;Tenoke Limited&amp;quot;. The company has developed a software to automatically and precisely assess atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, and to predict the risk of stroke for asymptomatic patients. The improved measurement of atherosclerosis performed during the project can be directly used by Tenoke's technologies to improve their predicting accuracy.

Economy and industry:

The remits of our characterisation method can be readily extended to all kinds of soft materials of the industrial realm: food, cosmetics, foams, detergent... Hence, our project will also contribute to a broader need for material characterisation, and we indeed believe that our technique can evolve towards such a generic method within the two years of the project. Once a validated prototype has been created, we will improve the design to use standard parts and to enable interested institutions to readily build their own instrument. Outside of the healthcare sector, many industries require mechanical characterisations for their product inspection, process control, or for their R&amp;amp;D labs. These tests are either performed in-house, or contracted to expert companies dedicated to material characterisation. We will reach out to these latter service companies, in order to understand their needs (and the ones of their customers) for measurement methods, and to evaluate the potential leverage of our technique in addressing those needs.
We will also consider commercialisation if it emerges as the best way to make our device accessible to other laboratories. We will, however, try to make sure that our design stays in the public domain so that patents will not prevent other groups to assemble themselves the instrument.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101305</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P021654/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FD25826C-8B50-43A3-8871-3FF08D051906</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomechanics &amp; Rehabilitation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
