During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries these aspects were particularly heightened, as the islands stood as a bulwark both politically, on the front line of the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and Europe, and religiously, as an outpost of Catholicism against Islam in the Mediterranean. 

This project will examine the unique socio-religious and political milieu of Malta in early seventeenth century by focusing on ideas of magic within this context, through a case-study of one specific magic-trial document as a case study, that of Sellem Bin al-Sheikh Mansur, a Muslim slave tried by the Roman Inquisition on Malta for practising magic. The major part of the project will be a transcription and translation of the trial proceedings, written in Latin, Italian and Arabic. This will provide important new evidence for academics in a wide variety of disciplines. The project will also provide a commentary on the proceedings which will involve the examination of other available source material, particularly other relevant trial records - both the minutes of the trial itself and the minutes of the sessions of torture the accused underwent, written by the notary, consisting of the Latin questions of the Inquisitor and the responses of the accused and of witnesses given in other languages, including Italian and Arabic - preserved in the Mdina Cathedral archives. As well as these, there are also graffiti written on the walls of the prison in Birgu where the accused were kept during their trial which shall be examined.

The importance of this project lies in the interdisciplinary nature of the evidence and the conclusions which can be drawn. Discourses surrounding accusations of witchcraft and magic in the early-modern period have been going on decades, with dozens of scholars producing various theories over aspects as varied as gender, the psychology of the torture victim, the development of beliefs over the abilities and activities of those practising magic, and the role of the secular and ecclesiastical authorities (among many others), which form the backbone of any discussion on magic and witchcraft during this period. However, these ideas are based almost exclusively on evidence from continental Europe and the British Isles, and there has been almost no examination of magic trials in some peripheral areas of Europe, of which Malta is a prime example, and comparatively little attempt to study the role of Islam in ideas of witchcraft in early-modern Europe. By examining the trial of Sellem this project will open up to study a different social, cultural and political milieu in which to test current theories in the fields referred to above, and thus can help to strengthen or weaken those theories.

It will also enable the exploration of aspects of Maltese society and Mediterranean history more widely during the period, such as Christian-Muslim Relations in the period, the role of the religious and secular powers of the Inquisition and Knights Hospitallers on Malta, and cultural diffusion in an area of intense cultural contact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Throughout history, in all places and within all cultures, ideas surrounding magic have both fascinated and terrified human society. This means that the public is always thirsty for more details on and information about ideas and allegations of magic, demonstrated by the popularity of magical elements within popular culture such as those in the Harry Potter series. This project, on a magic trial in Malta which is almost completely unknown even within academic study, is therefore of great interest to the general public internationally, and the results will be available to all with an interest in witchcraft and magic through the published outputs, which will be available in open access libraries such as Exeter. Many people have knowledge about magic trials in other areas of Europe and in North America, and will therefore be able to both understand and contextualise the conclusions drawn. 
The project will have a website on which the main objectives and information about the outputs will be available worldwide, which will link to a digital version of the trial document, and which will enable public debate surrounding the issues raised. The research team will use links within the media to draw public attention to the project and its conclusions through magazine articles and radio programmes, and will engage with West Country schools to raise the awareness of schoochildren magic and religion through the project.
There will be a public event at the British Academy, of which the PI is a Fellow, which will present the results of the research to an interested audience, discuss wider issues of cultural diffusion through the prism of magic, and then invite questions from the audience on these issues. There will also be a public lecture at Exeter by the co-I to present the main findings of the project.
The Maltese people will benefit through further understanding of their own history and culture, particularly in the light of their position at the cultural frontier between Europe and the Islamic world. These will be realised through a lecture by the PI at the Inquisition Palace at Birgu on the ramifications of the research for our understanding of Maltese history, and an exhibition at the same location.
People seeking to understand the historical relations between the Islamic world and the West, and those trying to build bridges between them, will also be able to benefit through an assessment of these unique historical circumstances in which Muslims and Christians related to each other, and how this may impact on the modern world.
Museums can use the results to inform exhibitions, ensuring they have access to the latest research, which will help them attract visitors and thereby increase their reputation and takings. This will be particularly so through the two exhibitions which will be part of the dissemination of the project, at Exeter and on Malta.
It may also allow charities and others who work with torture victims to benefit from greater understanding of the psychological effects of torture.
The nature of this project means its effects on people outside academia are likely to come in the medium- to long-term, and that much of the impact will also come from other scholars building on this project's results in order to further increase its impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>187064</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newspaper Interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDA8E1FA-3687-418F-8665-EBD22D59B056</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Rider gave an interview to the regional Sunday newspaper 'Western Morning News', in which she described the project's outline.

This involved the three members of the project team, as well three of the project's consultants: Jonathan Barry (Exeter), Liana Said (Oxford), and Joan Abela (Notarial Archives, Malta). We received much positive feedback and comments from the members of the mixed audience afterwards. This was only of the first examples of such debates on the island, and the first dealing with a delicate issue on Malta, due to the religious sensitivities surrounding both magic and the Christian-Muslim relations.

The debate feature Prof. Agius and Dr Rider from the project, as well as Dr Liana Saif (Oxford), Marion Gibson (Exeter, Penryn campus), and Ronald Hutton (Bristol). There was an extremely lively debate after, particularly regarding comparing magical practices in comparative contexts.
