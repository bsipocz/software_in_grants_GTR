In the fields of both practice and theory, conventional consumptions about the place of landscape in the national culture were challenged. Landscape once again became a significant subject for contemporary art, and new agendas were set for academic enquiry and museum display. The aim of the research network is to explore the question of how and why landscape came to be focus of innovatory practices and thinking in the visual arts in this period. It will also address the relationship of land art and landscape study in Britain to developments elsewhere in Europe and North America, and consider the extent to which the renewal of interest in the land as both an arena for artistic practice and field for study has continued to inform subsequent developments in contemporary art and art history.\n\nThe network will bring together art historians, museum and gallery curatos, artists and critics from a wide range of organisations concerned with the visual arts, and is intended to promote interaction between the academic community and interested bodies beyond it. In this way, the inter-relationship of new attitudes to land and ideas about landscape can be explored across art practice, critical interpretation, historical enquiry and exhibition-making. Land art and landscape studies have been engaged in, promoted, interpreted and debated across so many diverse contexts in the visual arts, but the connections between them have not been much acknowledged or understood. The proposed network encompasses all these contexts, and is well placed to achieve a new understanding of what have hitherto seemed only episodic and unconnected developments.\n\nThe three main partners in the project are the University of Nottingham, the Slade School of Fine Art and Tate, organisations concerned respectively with the study of art history, the teaching of creative practice and the collecting, documentation, interpretation and display of art. The network extends to include other participants including the Henry Moore institute and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, as well as from galleries in the private sector and independent critics and writers. There will be six meetings over a two-year-period. They will serve as a forum for the exchange of ideas, and some will involve presentations by participants or invited keynote speakers, including artists and others directly involved with land art or significant developments in historial analysis. The meetings will be held in venues appropriate to the subject, including Tate, the Slade, the Arts Council Longside Gallery at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and at the Arnolfini in Bristol, a city associated with some of the pioneering ventures in Land Art by Richard Long. These venues are chosen to reflect the idea that land art had, and continues to have, a regional as well as a metropolitan basis, but also because they are environments that might stimulate creative thinking, and in which discussion might be closely connected with the making of art itself, and with its documentation, interpretation and display. In parallel with these meetings there will be a series of interviews with artists, curators, dealers and critics who played a significant part in the making or dissemination of land or landscape art.\n\nMany of the organisations invovled in the network have their own gallery spaces and exhibition programmes, and one outcome of the project would be the preparation of proposals for exhibitions and displays, for example, for anyone of Tate's four sites, the Slades's newly acquired Woburn Square research space or the Djanology Gallery in Nottingham. Because Tate is a project partner, therewill be a special focus on works in its collection, and any new ideas and information will be made available to incorporate this into the Tate's web-based catalogue. Recorded interviews could be archived at Tate's Reasearch Centre. The project will have its own webpages; they will be managed from the Nottingham Institute for Research in Visual Culture and linked to the Research sections of Tate's websites. These outcomes envisage an afterlife for the project after the period of award, and also that the public is one of the intended audiences. The network is intended to forge the basis for future collaborations across the academic, museum and gallery sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22208</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E502903/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
