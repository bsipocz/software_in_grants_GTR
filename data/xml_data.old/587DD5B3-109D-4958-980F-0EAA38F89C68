The biocoal is formed in a process known as torrefaction by removing water and low energy volatiles from the wood by heating in a low oxygen environment. 
This is achieved in a closed reactor. The heat is provided by a gas which has been energised by microwaves to convert it to plasma. 
The system will be based on microwave induced plasma torch technology, which LJMU have been developing. LJMU's primary objective in this project will be to investigate the use of different plasma gases to make the torrefaction system as economical as possible, and this may require refinements to the current technology. They will also assess the properties of the plasma produced and the temperatures achieved inside the reactor to maximise its interaction with the wood pellets. The long-term performance of the plasma as part of a continuous industrial process will also be investigated.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project involves the development of a novel technological method for the production of biocoal by torrefaction. This approach delivers a number of environmental, economic and societal benefits and addresses all three components of the energy trilemma by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, improving security of energy supply and reducing energy costs. 
Environmental Impact: 
Burning wood derived biocoal instead of fossil fuels will reduce overall CO2 emissions because an equivalent amount of CO2 will have been removed from the atmosphere as the wood was produced by the parent tree. Provided that new trees are planted to replace those used, there will be no net change to CO2 levels in the atmosphere. The torrefaction process itself requires energy, but this will be significantly less than the calorific energy of the biocoal, so will only account for a relatively small amount of CO2. If wood is sourced in the UK, then the CO2 associated from importing coal will also be reduced. 
Burning fossil fuels not only causes CO2 levels to increase but as around 80% of the coal used in the UK is imported, energy security is also a major concern. Using biocoal derived from UK wood will make the UK less dependent on fossil fuel imports. 
As trees can be replaced as part of a sustainable forestry policy, wood can be used to create biocoal as a renewable energy source. 
Economic &amp;amp; commercial Impact: 
There are a number of direct economic and commercial impacts which could arise from this research project for both the industrial partners and end users of the technology. 
The industrial partner (Stopford) will benefit from the research by being able to commercialise the new technology, which will provide financial sustainability for the company and generate an estimated 20 jobs over the next 10 years. LJMU is working alongside Stopford to develop the technology so are therefore embedded within the research process. 
The end users of this technology will include global corporations such as Unilever, who rely on vast amounts of energy for their manufacturing and production processes across the world. The development of this approach will provide a cheaper and more sustainable means for generating energy which is derived from a renewable energy source. This will allow organisations to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels without having a detrimental impact on production, and will assist with compliance of regulations on carbon emissions and reduce the carbon footprint of the organisation globally. 
Unilever are an industrial partner within the project and will be a key contributor in the project meetings held throughout the research process. Other global corporations including those involved in coal burning power generation will also be engaged throughout the process in industrial seminars and demonstrations of the technology. 
Societal Impact: 
The technology developed in this research process is also expected to have a future long term impact on domestic energy use, by providing a stable and cost effective renewable energy source which is not reliant on fossil fuels. As fossil fuel reserves are depleted, the base cost increases which will drive up energy prices. Sustainable forests can be grown within the UK so there are reduced costs of transporting coal and fossil fuel from other countries outside of the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54611</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have confirmed that an atmospheric microwave induced plasma torch, developed at LJMU, can be used to successfully torrify preformed wood pellets.
