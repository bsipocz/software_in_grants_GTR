This workshop was jointly organized by the University of Surrey and the Shanghai Jiaotong University under the BBSRC International Partnering Scheme to promote exchange and collaboration between scientists from UK and China. International delegates from China and North America participated in the workshop; the UK participants included scientists and clinicians from Surrey, London, Bristol and Sheffield universities. Many participants were first year PhD students.

The workshop built on the first joint workshop held last year in Shanghai and was a great success. The speakers included both scientists and clinicians in various stages of their career. The topics ranged from basic science to clinical practice and covered the urothelium and its implications in overactive bladders (OAB), new insights into the central control of the visceral pain, the social and health impact of OAB, current therapies and trials of new treatments, adolescent urology, new regulators of bladder function and the epigenetic basis of bladder dysfunction. There was active discussion among all the delegates throughout the workshop. The discussion benefited from recent advances in bladder function and sensory control and stimulated close interactions between the basic scientists and the medical professionals. The students were fully engaged in the discussion.

The workshop received full support from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, the School of Bioscience and Medicine and the Department of Biochemistry and Physiology. Further national and international collaborations have been discussed among the scientists and clinicians. 

Surrey issued a news report on this workshop.

This workshop was very well received and had a significant impact on advancing the understanding bladder dysfunction and abdominal pain, generation of interest of these problems among scientists and non-academic professionals, helped young scientists and PhD students, raising the public awareness of these medical problems, strengthening UK research base, establishing a wide collaboration with Chinese scientists and clinicians including Shanghai and other parts of China, extension of international collaborations in US and Canada.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463a97900b7b8.70545195-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>A team of senior, intermediate and junior staff members from Shanghai participated in the presentation and discussion of the workshop; part of travel cost and expenses; material contributions to our lab.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>organizing and chairing the workshop, providing the fund to cover the workshop, travel and/or accommodation cost for external speakers, travel fund for PhD students and young scientists, part of fund for flight for Shanghai delegates, travel for Beijing speaker, giving main speeches, leading the discussions, catering.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Prof Rong Visit to Surrey Aug 2015</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C380901-8095-4778-AE26-5203E3E292EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>seminars, meetings and discussions on ageing bladder and bowels; mechanisms of visceral organ pain and age-dependent bladder dysfunction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df706eb12501.45519546-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof Rong gave a research seminar to our department and presented his findings on viceral organ pain.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I and my team directly interacted with Prof Rong's team and participated in the meeting and discussions.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Xuzhou Medical University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Surrey-Xu Zhou Medical University Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>2AC4A2A4-1BBE-45EB-8804-61BD70A897D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>plans for research project and teaching collaboration, exchange of postgraduate students and researchers, muiti-disciplinary, cardiovascular, stem cell and physiology, tissue regeneration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e045ab995cd4.46912882-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The director of graduate school and international exchange and department of Physiology has promoted this collaboration and held several meetings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have established this collaboration with Xu Zhou Medical University in China as part of Shanghai/China network, on teaching and research, gave several talks to different departments and groups, active discussions.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>The first BBSRC Surrey-Shanghai Jiaotong Joint Workshop on bladder overactivity and pain</gtr:description><gtr:id>EFE7087F-F203-480C-ACA3-62F537BFA983</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first BBSRC Surrey-Shanghai Jiaotong Joint Workshop on bladder overactivity and pain was held in Shanghai Jiaotong University in
October 2012. This workshop was jointly organised by Shanghai Jiaotong University and University of Surrey under the BBSRC International
Partnering Scheme to promote exchange and collaborations between scientists from UK and China. Scientists and clinicians from Shanghai,
Beijing, East China and South China regions in China and University of Surrey participated in the workshop.The workshop capitalised on the success of the 42nd International Continence Society Annual Meeting held earlier in Beijing and covered the topics of pathophysiology of overactive bladders (OAB), clinical aspects of OAB and current therapies for OAB, the role of urothelium as the novel sensory structure and its pathophysiological implications, application of electro-acupuncture in OAB and afferent control of bladder and
electrophysiological techniques. The participants visited the state key laboratory led by Professor Weifang Rong and were very impressed by
the full range of the state-of-art facilitates.The Department of Physiology also ran a practical demonstration on
afferent nerve recording in the bladder. Targeting urothelium as a novel therapeutic approach and electro-acupuncture were hot topics of the
workshop and stimulated extensive discussion among the participants.
Further bilateral collaborations between UK and Chinese scientists have been discussed. 
There was a news report on this workshop.
The meeting has promoted the partnership between UK and Chinese scientists and scientific exchange, strengthened research bases in UK and China, enhanced University of Surrey's international reputation, promoted cultural exchange. It also greatly raised the public awareness of bladder problems and pelvic floor organ pain.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639f67b05cd1.22914831-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Organizing and chairing the workshop; providing catering, liaising participants in Shanghai and other regions of China; providing funds for the workshop; giving talks to the workshop.

This workshop was jointly organized by the University of Surrey and the Shanghai Jiaotong University under the BBSRC International Partnering Scheme to promote exchange and collaboration between scientists from UK and China. International delegates from China and Noth America participated in the workshop; the UK participants included scientists and clinicians from Surrey, London, Bristol and Sheffield universities. Many participants were first year PhD students. 

The workshop built on the first joint workshop held last year in Shanghai and was a great success. The speakers included both scientists and clinicians in various stages of their career. The topics ranged from basic science to clinical practice and covered the urothelium and its implications in overactive bladders (OAB), new insights into the central control of the visceral pain, the social and health impact of OAB, current therapies and trials of new treatments, adolescent urology, new regulators of bladder function and the epigenetic basis of bladder dysfunction. There was active discussion among all the delegates throughout the workshop. The discussion benefited from recent advances in bladder function and sensory control and stimulated close interactions between the basic scientists and the medical professionals. The students were fully engaged in the discussion.

Further national and international collaborations have been discussed among the scientists and clinicians.

A variety of topics from basic science and clinical advances were presented and actively dicussed.

This workshop has large impact in China regarding overactive bladders and pain mechanisms in the visceral organs. We have written a news report of this workshop on University of Surrey's website to increase the publicity. One emerging area is the exploitation of electro-acupuncture to treat overactive bladders. Leaflet were circulated in several institutions in Shanghai.
