That molecules stick to clay has been known by scientists since the 1960s. Doctors observed that absorption into the blood stream of certain drugs was severely reduced when patients were also receiving clay-based antacid or anti-diarrhoeal treatments. This curious phenomenon was realized to be due to binding of the drugs by clay particles. This interaction is now routinely harnessed in the design of tablets to carefully control the release and action of a drug. 

Dr Dawson now proposes to use this property of clay to create micro-environments that could stimulate stem cells to regenerate damaged tissues such as bone, skin, heart, spinal cord, liver, pancreas and cornea.

The rich electrostatic properties of nano (1 millionth of a millimetre) -scale clay particles which mediate these interactions could allow two hurdles facing the development of stem-cell based regenerative therapies to be overcome simultaneously.

The first challenge - to deliver and hold stem cells at the right location in the body - is met by the ability of clays to self-organise into gels via the electrostatic interactions of the particles with each other. Cells mixed with a low concentration (less than 4%) of clay particles can be injected into the body and held in the right place by the gel, eliminating, in many situations, the need for surgery. 

Clay particles can also interact with large structural molecules (polymers) which are frequently used in the development of materials (or 'scaffolds'), designed to host stem cells. These interactions can greatly improve the strength of such structures and could be applied to preserve their stability at the site of injury until regeneration is complete.

While several gels and scaffold materials have been designed to deliver and hold stem cells at the site of regeneration, the ability of clay nanoparticles to overcome a second critical hurdle facing stem-cell therapy is what makes them especially exciting. 

Essential to directing the activity of stem-cells is the carefully controlled provision of key biological signalling molecules. However, the open structures of conventional scaffolds or gels, while essential for the diffusion of nutrients to the cells, means their ability to hold the signalling molecules in the same location as the cells is limited. The ability of clay nano-particles to bind biological molecules presents a unique opportunity to create local environments at a site of injury or disease that can stimulate and control stem-cell driven repair. 

Dr Dawson's early studies investigated the ability of clay gels to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels by incorporating a key molecular signal that stimulates this process, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In a manner reminiscent of the observations made in the 60s, Dr Dawson and colleagues observed that adding a drop of clay gel to a solution containing VEGF caused, after a few hours, the disappearance of VEGF from the solution as it became bound to the gel. When placed in an experimental injury model, the gel-bound VEGF stimulated a cluster of new blood vessels to form. 

These exciting results indicate the potential of clay nanoparticles to create tailor-made micro-environments to foster stem cell regeneration. Dr Dawson is developing this approach as a means of first exploring the biological signals necessary to successfully control stem cell behaviour for regeneration and then, using the same approach, to provide stem cells with these signals to stimulate regeneration in the body.

The project will seek to test this approach to regenerate bone lost to cancer or hip replacement failure. If successful the same technology may be applied to harness stem cells for the treatment of a whole host of different scenarios, from burn victims to those suffering with diabetes or Parkinson's.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By 2033 23% of the UK population will be aged over 65. With this increase the already substantial socio-economic cost incurred by inadequate bone/ cartilage reconstructive techniques will increase dramatically. Fractures alone currently cost the European economy 17 billion euros and the US economy $20 billion annually. Worldwide, over 4 million bone replacement procedures are carried out each year, 90% of which rely on either the painful and source-restricted transplantation of the patient's own bone, or else, cadaveric bone matrix which provides only temporary structural support. By proposing a novel translatable approach to harnessing stem cells for skeletal regeneration this research program has potential to impact this unmet need and improve quality of life.

The direct beneficiaries of this work will be orthopaedic, spine and maxillofacial patients and related healthcare staff for whom current reparative options have proved inadequate. Additional beneficiaries will include the UK tax payer through reducing cost of, for example, revision surgery, and UK industry by feeding the private biomedical technology sector. In the long-term, the implications of this proposal have considerably broader regenerative applications extending the list of potential beneficiaries to include burn victims, sufferers of Parkinson's and diabetes, as well as transplant patients - all with associated broader socio-economic benefits. Educational benefit will also be sought through the development of a high-quality public engagement programme, and by investing in young research talent. 

As an example of an application promising near-term socio-economic benefit, I present proof-of-concept that clay particle coating of cadaveric bone matrix can hold a potent bone inducing molecule to its surface. This could enhance the efficacy of a widely used intervention for bone reconstructive surgery. I am currently working with University of Southampton Research and Innovation Services (RIS) to patent this approach. In years 1-2 I will explore with RIS and the Medical Technologies Innovation and Knowledge Centre in Leeds to explore commercialisation routes (licensing or spin out) for this technology. The University of Southampton has a particularly successful record of commercial translation with a direct annual income of &amp;pound;500,000 from licensing and the launch of 12 spin-outs, since 2001, with a current market value of circa &amp;pound;150M.

In years 3-5 I will intensively pursue collaborations with disease-focussed research and industry to target both long and near-term beneficiaries beyond skeletal applications. For example, I recently received as co-applicant, 'Adventures in Research' pilot funding in collaboration with Dr Nicholas Evans, University of Southampton, seeking to apply clay gels for enhancing regeneration in ulcerative skin conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers. 

As well as direct socioeconomic impact, the proposal will benefit emerging research talent within the University of Southampton through immersing graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher (PDRA) in a rigorous multidisciplinary research program. Beyond academic development, I will involve the PDRA in public engagement (below) and in the exploration of translational pathways.

I recognise that continued public engagement around the themes of stem cells and regenerative medicine is vital to maintain public confidence and strengthen the case for investment. I am a passionate communicator of science and value the opportunities that active involvement in regenerative research presents to engage in discussions around this hot-topic. I have requested &amp;pound;35k to allow me to develop, in the first year, an interactive teaching aid with public engagement specialists to feature in the &amp;quot;Bringing Research to Life Roadshow&amp;quot;. This will extend and enhance the educational impact of this programme throughout the time frame of the grant, and beyond, to a broad public audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1049043</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC grant generated the centre piece of our exhibit - the Stem cell mountain - a large interactive pinball machine built in collaboration with Winchester Science Centre to communicate the concept of Stem Cell Potential</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C3D19B4-D33A-4BF2-8866-1486DFB96FDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibit has substantially enhanced our engagement activities both in terms of quality and quantity of impact.

I have acquired Higher Education Innovation funding (HEIF) for an industrial collaboration with BYK (a subsidiary of Altana) to optimise clay formulations for regenerative applications with a view to consolidating a licensable regulatory package. As part of this strategy I am co-founder of a soon to be registered spin-out company which will further facilitate the commercialisation and translation of this technology - with associated economic and health impact.

As well as direct socio-economic impact I requested &amp;pound;35k to develop, in the first year, an interactive teaching aid with public engagement specialists to extend and enhance the educational impact of this program throughout the time frame of the grant, and beyond, to a broad public audience. We have now developed an extremely successful engagement activity in collaboration with Winchester Science Center called the Stem Cell Mountain. Through the University of Southampton Roadshow this has now engaged over 8000 people at music and science festivals, county fairs, open days and school visits, as well as the annual 200000 visitors to the Winchester Science Center where it is resident when not on tour. Indeed the exhibit is so popular we have now made a replica so it can remain as a permanent fixture at the science center. The stem cell mountain was awarded the Best Engagement Activity Award by the university of Southampton Roadshow team with the following award citation: &amp;quot;Starting with what is basically a giant and rather wonderful marble run, this team have used it as a base to discuss the complexities of stem cell pluripotency and to connect the core science of stem cells to a wide range of research fields that cross divides between biology, medicine and engineering. It helps of course that the large team seem to work particularly well together and that the lead researcher is an inspired science communicator.&amp;quot;

Two further unexpected outcomes emerged from this public engagement activity:
1) We have received orders for 2 further replicas of the stem cell mountain from external institutions (national and international) which I hope will generate around &amp;pound;20k profit to be put back into research and outreach. We have now established a sustainable manufacturing process and will explore the possibility of marketing the exhibit more widely.

2) The exhibit provided the context for a conversation through which a talented international MSc student from Queen Mary's was inspired to commence a PhD project (self-funded) in my group which started in October 2015. She is now an enthusiastic supporter of the groups engagement activities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>90463DEA-D311-4411-8698-53E1D6FB136E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b92fecfda9.91122485</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Patent describing the development of hyaluronic acid clay nano composites arising from our collaboration with Uppsala University.

Clay particles dispersed in water can self-organise into gels able to contain the biological molecules that stimulate stem cells to regenerate diseased or injured tissue. We have just completed a series of studies indicating that clay gels can be used to encapsulate bone marrow derived stem cells and stimulate them to specialise into bone forming cells. In particular we observed that the clay gel environment enhances the formation of the mineralised component of bone tissue. We are currently seeking to clarify the mechanism for this interesting property before submitting for publication. 

2) Clay gels can deliver, localize and enhance the activity of a powerful inducer of bone formation in the body. 
The protein BMP2 has been widely used in orthopaedics to stimulate bone formation to fuse bones and repair fractures. The use of this powerful molecule has, however, been beset with problems such as bone formation in the wrong place and swelling of soft tissues. These problems are due to the very high doses required because of the protein's characteristic instability. We have shown that clay gels are extremely effective at localizing and sustaining the activity of BMP2 to enhance its efficacy and, potentially, reduce the likelihood of dangerous side-effects. For example by delivering BMP2 encapsulated within clay gels we have found that we can stimulate new bone formation at doses 3000 times lower than currently used in clinical practice. This finding has been reported at 6 national/international academic conferences and is currently under-review by the journal Biomaterials. We are now in a position to explore this exciting avenue in preclinical models of bone repair.

3) An originally proposed collaboration exploring a polymer clay composite strategy for bone repair has proved unsuccessful. 
An injectable hard scaffold formulation (PLGA-PEG) developed in collaboration with the University of Nottingham was tested using an early stage chick egg toxicology assay prior to commencing a full in vivo assessment. The study indicated poor toleration of the composite scaffold as well as problems in sustaining scaffold cohesion in a physiological aqueous environment. This particular approach is not being pursued further.

4) Clay nanoparticles can be applied to sustain cell attachment and growth on a notoriously anti-adhesive biomaterial.
In collaboration with University of Uppsala we are exploring the opportunities presented by clay nanoparticles for enhancing a widely used natural biological polymer, hyaluronic acid. As well as providing a chemical-free approach to forming stiff injectable hydrogels through physical interactions between the polymer and the clay we have also found that clay particles can provide adhesion sites allowing cells to attach and grow on these otherwise anti-adhesive materials. This provides several new avenues of investigation which we are currently exploring.

5) Clay nanoparticle gels can be applied topically to chronic skin wounds (such as diabetic ulcers) to significantly improve both the rate and quality of wound healing. Interestingly, this result is independent of addition of growth factors or other biological agents and represents an intrinsic effect of the clay gels in this environment. This result is currently written up for publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our most notable finding is of potentially great significance to orthopedic, spine and maxillofacial surgery.

This ability, which first motivated the widespread application of BMP2 in fracture healing and spinal arthrodesis has, more recently, been indicated as one of several serious adverse effects associated with the supra-physiological doses of BMP2 relied upon for clinical efficacy. Key to harnessing BMPs and other agents safely and effectively will be the
ability to localize activity at a target site at substantially reduced doses. Clay (Laponite) nanoparticles can self assemble into gels under physiological conditions and bind growth factors for enhanced and localized efficacy. We have shown the ability to localize and enhance the activity of BMP2 to achieve ectopic bone formation at doses within the sub-microgram per ml range of concentrations sufficient to induce
differentiation of responsive cell populations in vitro and at approximately 3000 fold lower than those employed in clinical practice.

We are currently pursuing 2 strands of development towards the clinical translation of this device. 

1) Large animal pre-clinical studies in direct comparison with the current gold standard approach (InductOs TM) 
2) Refinement in clay mineral production in collaboration with BYK, Altana and pursuit of regulatory approval.</gtr:description><gtr:id>840FEC6D-6EF4-494D-B7B6-1813568F3992</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nothing additional to report at this stage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1417936c1c9.72551915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Refinement.
