From the 60 million people that have been infected with HIV-1, 25 million have dead. Very important advances have been done to better understand HIV-1 infection in the past. However, the technical developments achieved in the last decade open now the possibility of exploring an infected cell in an unprecedented depth. 
Once HIV-1 penetrated into the host cell the viral particles disassemble, releasing the genomic RNA that is covered by viral and host proteins. This protein-RNA complex travels towards the nucleus and, during the path, HIV-1 genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into DNA to form the provirus. Once in the nucleus, the provirus is integrated into the cellular chromosome. Synthesis, processing and transport back to the cytoplasm of newly synthesized HIV-1 RNAs are mediated by the host machinery. Importantly, translation of HIV-1 RNAs is exerted by cellular protein synthesis machinery, producing the viral proteins required to generate the viral progeny. Therefore, HIV-1 relies on cellular resources from the entrance in the infected cell to the release of viral progeny. Because HIV-1 strongly relies on host gene expression machinery, scientists envision that inhibition of a cellular function that is required for viral replication and does not compromise cell survival, will represent an alternative strategy to treat HIV-1 infection.
RNA-binding proteins are key &amp;quot;players&amp;quot; of gene expression machinery and this protein class has emerged as crucial regulators of HIV-1 infection. However, to identify novel therapeutic targets, scientists have first to determine the exact repertoire of cellular proteins involved in HIV-1 replication. To date this catalog of host factors is still incomplete in spite of the numerous efforts undertaken to better understand HIV-1-host cell interactions. The methods that I developed during my postdoctoral work offer now the possibility to globally define the scope of host proteins that directly interact with HIV-1 genomic RNA. The repertoire of proteins identified by these methods will be studied in detail in cultured cells and mouse models using different biochemical approaches. Proteins proven by these analyses to play an essential role in HIV-1 replication may represent potential host-based targets to treat the infection. Therefore, this project aims at finding potential therapeutic targets by expanding our knowledge in HIV-1 biology using novel system-wide approaches.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>HIV-1 encodes only 15 distinct polypeptides, so it relies heavily on host proteins for replication. After reverse transcription, HIV-1 proviral DNA is integrated into the cellular chromosome. This allows viral RNAs to be synthesized, processed, exported and translated by the host cell machinery. This proposal aims at comprehensively identifying the catalog of host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression by applying novel system-wide methodologies built on protocols developed during my postdoctoral work. HIV-1-infected cells will be irradiated with ultraviolet light to crosslink proteins to RNA. HIV-1 RNAs will be isolated through stringent washes using specific locked nucleic acid probes. Co-isolated proteins will be identified by mass spectrometry. I will also analyze the RBPs activated and inactivated by HIV-1 infection using standard &amp;quot;mRNA interactome capture&amp;quot; protocol. Functionally relevant RBPs will be selected by applying sophisticated data analysis and their effects in HIV-1 infection will be evaluated in functional assays. Those RBPs causing strong phenotypes in viral replication will be characterized at the molecular level to understand their role in HIV-1 gene expression. The impact of one selected RBP in systemic HIV-1 infection will be determined using mouse transgenic models. This proposal may reveal the host circuits controlling HIV-1 gene expression, representing an important resource to expand our knowledge in HIV-1 biology.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>HIV-1 is a global health threat that affects millions of people overseas. By the end of 2011, 96,000 people were estimated to be infected with HIV-1 in United Kingdom and almost one million in Western Europe. To design efficient treatments, scientists need first to understand the sophisticated mechanisms developed by HIV-1 to replicate. This proposal aims at providing a comprehensive snapshot of the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression exerted by this pathogen. Therefore, an improvement of our knowledge in HIV-1 infection may benefit directly and indirectly UK population as well as worldwide patients due to pandemic status of this pathogen. This proposal aims at revisiting HIV-1 infection from a systems biology point of view, making use of the latest high-throughput technologies. Resulting datasets will not be only of interest for scientists, as outlined before, but also for the commercial sector. Conventional antiviral regimens target viral enzymes, blocking viral replication. However, the high rate of errors introduced by the viral retrotranscriptase in each replication round promotes the emergence of drug-resistant variants. For this reason, new generation antiviral drugs target host proteins which are essential for viral replication, but are dispensable for cell survival. This is the case of debio, and inhibitor of the cellular factor cyclophilin A that is essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. This drug is currently in phase III of clinical trials and has proven to perform excellently when combined with interferons. One of the aims of this proposal is to find host factors playing essential roles in HIV-1 replication that will constitute potential therapeutic targets for HIV-1 treatment. The best candidates for such possibility will be characterized at the molecular level to understand their function in the cellular context. This information will be instrumental to develop strategies to inhibit these proteins. Moreover, the effects of the loss of function of a selected RBP in HIV-1 systemic infection will be explored in a mouse transgenic model. This will instruct about the feasibility and the consequences of using these proteins as targets to block viral replication. Taking together, these data may help to identify host-based therapeutic targets for HIV-1 infection, offering an excellent opportunity to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the future. Therefore, the possible outcomes of this project can potentially benefit HIV-1 patients as well as the private sector involved in HIV-1 therapeutic research. 
The methods that I will develop for this proposal can serve as a basis for other research projects aiming at studying RBP dynamics in different biological contexts. This may place my future lab as an &amp;quot;epicenter&amp;quot; for collaborative works with other national and international institutions. All these together may contribute to the technological development of UK as well as to the international visibility of the host institution. I also expect that the discoveries made during the accomplishment of this proposal can serve as a starting point for subsequent research projects that may attract funding from international agencies (e.g. ERC).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1359706</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Quantitative Proteomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>411BED90-614C-4525-B3A0-CFCCD919A33B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

This method combines UV crossliking on living cells to covalently link nucleotides and amino acids placed at zero distances. After lysis, protein-RNA complexes are isolated under denaturing conditions and eluates are treated with a protease that cleaves every 17 amino acids in average. The RNA with the protein portion still crosslinked to it are purified with oligo (dT). After tryptic digestion, peptides are identified by mass spectrometry. This has been recently published in Molecular Cell (Castello et al., Mol Cell, 2016). Following this protocol, we can identify the sites of contact between proteins and RNA. In particular, we identified more than 1,100 RNA binding sites mapped to 529 human proteins.</gtr:description><gtr:id>01D846D6-DA48-416C-95C8-1258224C1FB6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first in vivo established repertoire of RNA-binding domains.

This an arthropod-borne alphavirus highly related to important human and animal pathogens such as semliki forest virus, chikungunya virus and western and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. This is a very well-characterised viral model that allow us to obtain large quantities of infected cells easily. Uninfected cells and cells infected for 4 or 18 hours were irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light. UV irradiation promotes cross-links between proteins and RNA interacting at &amp;quot;zero distances&amp;quot;. Next, host and viral polyadenylated RNAs are isolated by hybridization with oligo(dT) magnetic beads. Proteins are eluted by RNases and analysed by mass spectrometry. Note that at late times post infection, near to 80% of the polyadenylated RNA in the cell is viral RNA. Therefore, proteins with increased RNA binding activity after infection are likely to interact with the viral RNA. We identified hundred proteins with increased RNA-binding activity after infection and individual characterisation showed that they localise at the cytoplasmic foci where SINV replicates, suggesting direct interaction with the viral RNA. Knock down or chemical inhibition of this proteins lead to abrogation of viral infection. Taken together, these data strongly support the capacity of RNA interactome capture at identifying host factors involved in virus infection.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0839A37-4C79-4AED-B1D3-3BAFCC9ABBDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This protocol represents a tour de force allow efficient identification of host RNA-binding proteins involved in virus infection through their direct interaction with the viral RNA. Since RNA viruses represent one of the most important threats in human health, we think our protocol will have a major impact in the field. Note that 80% of the proteins identified lead to phenotypes in viral replication when tested in functional assays (knock down, chemical inhibition and over-expression). We have recently observe that several the RBPs identified to sustain SINV replication are also important in the infection of other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This reflects the already observed phenomenon that viruses from different origins have developed convergent mechanism to target particular resources of the cell that often involve the same host proteins.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b05bb514e857.08940027</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Identification of RNA-binding proteins required in virus infection by RNA interactome capture</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a fully infective HIV variant expressing mCherry (a red fluorescent protein) fused to an accessory protein. This virus has been proven very useful to monitor HIV infection in real time using both microscopy and a CO2-controlled plate reader. Basically, cells become red when they express the viral protein fused to mCherry. Taking advantage of this virus as well as an effective antibody recognising a viral (late) structural protein, we can sort with high purity cells under different stages of infection using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This technical advance will allow us to study the host cell-virus interactions occurring at different stages of infection. This method will have a big impact in bulk and single cell analyses and will be of broad interest in the field.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C28F3B14-F71C-4308-A61C-2C3A4C1D506B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We noticed that HIV infected cells are highly heterogeneous. This is in part because HIV infection is asynchronic, exhibiting enormous cell-to-cell variations. Asynchronous infection is associated to i) the high variability of the pre-integration step that can take from 4 to 12h, ii) the non-parallel transcriptional activation of the provirus after integration and iii) the short nature of the early phase (2-4 h). Moreover, we and others noticed that an important proportion of cells do not show traces of HIV even when infected with excess of virus. This suggests that these cells are either more refractory to infection or that the provirus has entered into a dormant state (latency). The handful on transcriptomic and proteomic studies available to date disregarded these facts and has used &amp;quot;time post infection&amp;quot; to separate HIV infection stages. Having a reliable and easy-to-apply method to separate cells under different stages of infection, we will be able to perform transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in homogeneous population of cells, which will increase the signal of the assay over the experimental noise and intra-sample variations. 

Global analyses of primary cells have remained a challenge so far due to the low penetrance of HIV infection in these cultures (~10%). Our approach can separate the infected cells from the uninfected ones, being compatible with primary cultures. This will open the possibility to study inter-individual variations of HIV infection. Moreover, our approach can be applied to single cell studies to identify inter-cellular variations of HIV infection and cellular responses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b0538d1a96d3.76840873</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of cells under different
