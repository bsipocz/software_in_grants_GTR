Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that causes over a million deaths per year worldwide. TB treatment involves taking a complex cocktail of antibiotics for many months. Although TB infection usually occurs in the lung, other sites of the body can also be affected, such as the brain and spine. TB infection in the brain usually occurs in children and those who have a suppressed immune system. With currently available treatment, one in five patients with TB brain infections die, and over half of those who survive have significant permanent disabilities. One reason for this may be that antibiotics used to treat TB do not get to the areas of the brain where the bacteria are living and growing.

Aims and Objectives
The aim of this research is to understand and describe the concentration of different antibiotics in the brain and spinal fluid compared to the blood. This information will be used along with measurements from previous studies where samples were obtained from human patients to build mathematical models. These models will describe how the concentrations of drugs change in different areas of the brain over time. This can be used to make computer simulations to find drug doses and combinations that will best treat TB infection in the brain. These doses and drug combinations can then be tested in clinical trials. Another problem is that TB from blood and spinal fluid samples grow very slowly (or may not grow at all) in the laboratory. This makes TB a difficult condition to diagnose. This project will also, therefore, investigate how TB can best be diagnosed and monitoring with new tests that have been developed and tested in TB lung infection.

Methods
TB infection involves a complex interaction between the TB bacteria, the immune system, and antibiotic medicines. For this reason, the experiments to study TB treatments will necessarily use infected animals. The use of an in vivo model will allow for tissue samples to be collected that cannot be obtained regularly from human patients or synthesised in the lab (for example brain tissue). Animals will be infected with TB and receive drugs at different doses. A new scanning techniques will be used to show how much of each drug reaches the brain and highlight 'hot spots' (containing high concentrations of drug) and 'cold spots' (containing low drug concentrations). These scans will be compared to those showing where in the brain the TB bacteria are living and growing. Together, this information will be used to build mathematical models that describe the amount of drugs in different areas of the brain and in the spinal fluid over time. The models developed will allow us to make predictions about whether treatment would work under new conditions using computer simulations (for example if a higher dose or new combination is used) and identify the combination and doses of drugs that have the highest chance of effectively treatment the infection. 

Potential Applications and Benefits
The findings of this work have the potential to directly improve the lives of people who suffer from TB brain infection by identifying treatments which are more effective. The findings from the project will provide evidence to plan clinical trials of new and existing treatments, and assist national and international organisations that publish guidelines and recommendations on which drugs and doses doctors should use to treat TB. The work will also develop new methods to study how well drugs reach their site of action using of state-of-the-art scans and mathematical models. As well as giving information about the best treatments for TB these methods may be used to provide information on how to best treat many other diseases affecting the brain and infections elsewhere in the body, such as epilepsy, stroke or cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims 
This work aims is to define safe and effective therapeutic regimens to improve clinical outcomes in central nervous system (CNS) infection due to M. tuberculosis (Mtb). 

Methods
An in vivo model that recapitulates the pathology of CNS infection will be used. Concentration-time profiles of anti-Mtb drugs will be quantified in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain and meninges using standard LC-MS/MS. The spatial distribution of anti-Mtb drugs within CNS subcompartments will be visualised using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Adjacent tissue sections will be stained for acid fast bacilli and histopathological architecture. Clinically relevant biochemical markers (CSF total protein, glucose, and white cell count) and novel genetic PD endpoints (bacterial chromosome equivalents and Mtb 16s rRNA) will be investigated and compared with quantitative culture. Experimental data will be used to construct and fit structural PKPD models. Innovative spatially-resolved PKPD models, which describe drug kinetics as a function of both time and space, will be developed. The clinical implications of experimental data will be examined by simulating humanised dosing regimens in silico.

Scientific and Medical Opportunities
This work will benefit the agencies working to improve clinical outcomes for the millions of patients infected with Mtb worldwide, for which effective and affordable treatment regimens are urgently needed. PKPD modelling is an important tool to identify therapeutic targets and predict outcomes of novel regimens. Current models describe drug kinetics in homogeneous non-physiological compartments, an assumption which is known to have major limitations for anti-Mtb drugs. The development of spatially-resolved models to describe the PKPD of drugs within infected tissue would represent a significant advancement in the field, with broad application to drug development programs and optimised clinical use.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Global Stakeholders
The primary beneficiaries of this work will be the global agencies seeking to improve clinical outcomes for the millions of patients worldwide who are infected with M. tuberculosis and in urgent need of effective and affordable treatment. The complex field of TB research is coordinated through several international consortia and public-private partnerships. These include the TB Alliance, Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens (CPTR), PreDiCT-TB and the STOP TB Partnership. Global stakeholders will both inform and benefit from this work through reciprocal communication at each stage of experimental planning, data analysis, and dissemination of findings. 

National and Local Governmental Stakeholders
Policymakers and Government stakeholders within the UK will benefit from this work. Tuberculosis is an increasing healthcare concern in the UK, where human migration and a poorly coordinated public health response have been associated with a year-on-year increase in TB cases; in 2013, there were 7290 reported new cases in the UK, with an estimated cost to the NHS of &amp;pound;61 million. In response, Public Health England, in partnership with local and national agencies, published the 'Collaborative Tuberculosis Strategy for England 2015 to 2020', which outlines plans for a coordinated strategy overseen by a national TB oversight group and local TB control boards. Participating stakeholders within these groups will benefit from this work through the dissemination of findings in nationally distributed evidence summaries and by contribution to evidence-based model service specifications. 

Industrial, Academic and Regulatory Stakeholders
Population PKPD modelling has an established role in drug development programmes. Recent funding and regulatory changes reflect the increasing role PKPD modelling has in identifying useful surrogate endpoints, predicting outcomes with novel regimens and in neglected populations, and in individualising therapy. Currently, models geneally describe drug kinetics within homogeneous non-physiological compartments, an assumption that is known to have major limitations for conditions such as Mtb infection, where drug exposure within target tissues is critical. The development and successful application of spatially-resolved models to describe the dynamic distribution of drugs within infected tissue would represent a significant advancement in the field, with broad application to drug development programmes. Novel techniques will be developed with, and disseminated to, relevant industrial, academic and regulatory stakeholders. This will be achieved with the timely presentation of findings at scientific meetings and submission to peer-reviewed journals, as well as through contribution to pharmacometric workgroup meetings, national workshops, and at international meetings such as those organised by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease PK/PD of Anti-Infectives Study Group. Methods, explanatory videos and open-source software will be made available on a purpose-build website and in contributions to Pmetrics an Comprehensive R Archive Network forums. 

Public and Patient-Group Stakeholders
Patient-groups are likely to benefit from improved diagnostic and treatment strategies for TB infection. In addition, the general public will benefit from an improved understanding of current and future treatments against TB. The findings of this work will be disseminated to public audiences through progress summaries issued via the project website, regular social media updates, and press releases to charitable partner organisations such as TB Alert and the Avert. The principles and practical implications of this work will also be explored in engagement activities as part of of the University of Liverpool's 'Science and Society' programme, which includes workshops, open lectures and museum exhibits that explore the societal impacts of scientific advancement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280754</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P000665/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
