A re-analysis of the British Crime Survey</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002899/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW: one of the world?s leading surveys in the measurement of domestic violence over time) has recorded a declining rate in domestic violence for more than a decade (1995-2009). However, data recorded from 2009 suggests the year-on-year rate of domestic violence may have stabilised or even be increasing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Enormous energy and resource has been expended in developing policy responses to reduce domestic and gender-based violence. This policy goal has been consistent across governments. There has been extraordinary success in driving down the rate of domestic violence. Data suggesting the rate of domestic violence has now stabilised or maybe increasing, rather than continuing to decline, is therefore acutely challenging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This SDAI (Secondary DAta Initiative) project explores in detail changes in the rate of domestic violence over time through the CSEW. It assesses the impact of different survey methodologies and examines whether: the rate of change over time differs with alternative definitions and/or thresholds of violence; rates over time differ across different sub-groups; and whether there are correlations with changes in gender regimes, the economy, and other crime types.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The implications of these findings for theories of violence, for policy, and for sites of intervention are also considered.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to contribute to the development of policy and practice to reduce and eliminate domestic violence and violence against women and girls by analysing changes over time in domestic violence and violence against women using the British Crime Survey.

The project would engage with policy makers and practitioners who are already pursuing these goals and have already articulated needs for research-based information that are not currently met. For example, HM Government's refreshed 'Call to End Violence Against Women and Girls' launched in March 2012 has 100 action points, several of which could usefully draw on the data that this project would provide. Policy makers in this area need to know whether domestic violence is increasing, stabilised or decreasing, and the sub-groups who are most affected.

The team is already part of the relevant policy and pracitioner networks as a result of prior research that has been fruitfully used by these communities. Hence we can realistically anticipate rapid early policy and practitioner impacts.

Policy makers and practitioners to be engaged with include:
Government policy makers: policy makers on violence against women and girls in the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, Crown Prosecution Service, ACPO and other Departments that contribute to the Inter-Ministerial/Departmental Group on VAWG; 
Local government: e.g. London Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime
Other relevant bodies: e.g. Equality and Human Rights Commission, All Party Parliamentary Group on Domestic and Sexual Violence; BCS team and user group; 
Practitioners, including service providers and second tier organisations: Women's Aid, Respect, Ava, EVAW, Corporate Alliance Against Domestic Violence, Nia; the police. 
European and international policy relevant bodies: EU Institute for Gender Equality, European Commission, European Parliament, EU Fundamental Rights Agency, UNESCO, UN Women. 

It is intended to engage with policy makers and practitioners, through: 
Contributing findings to meetings and conferences; 
Organising a final workshop to disseminate findings to policy makers and practitioners;
Producing briefing notes for specific audiences and publishing in practitioner journals;
Developing a mini web-site and web-based materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158849</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reappraising the Measurement of Domestic Violence Using the CSEW' Crime Survey Users Group December 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FF57451-6338-4CB9-934B-7D2E30B96164</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked many discussions and led to networking opportunities with other academics in the field and with professional practitioners working on the design of the CSEW and the analysis of its data for official publication.

Changes in the rate of domestic violence have potentially wide social repercussions, so there has been significant interest from policy makers, service providers and the public in our research, which has implications for public policy. In addition to our substantive findings, our research has contributed new methodologies to more accurately measure this violence, which have generated engagement from policy bodies amid interest from the wider public. The ONS initiated a review of their methodology for measuring high frequency victimisation in the Crime Survey for England and Wales following an invited presentation at a meeting of the UK Statistics Authority that generated substantial press interest, which was based on our published findings in The Sociological Review, mediated by a short research briefing note. We submitted a response to the ONS 'Consultation on Methodology to Address High Frequency Repeat Victimization in Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates' based on the findings from this research project. The ONS has agree that the methodology for estimating high frequency repeat victimisation will be revised and discussions are on-going as to the specifics of the new methodology which will be enacted for all future crime estimates using CSEW data, and the production of new crime estimates for all previous CSEW sweeps using the new methodology, once agreed. We have been invited onto the steering committee of a wider ONS review of domestic abuse statistics. We have been invited as independent experts to the Eurostat Taskforce which will develop and deliver a new survey on gender-based violence across the EU. We are consulted for the best statistics on domestic violence by a range of UK public bodies, including the Women's Aid Federation. 

The work has contributed to a new policy agenda for the development of data on gender-based violence led by European bodies, including the Council of Europe and the European Institute for Gender Equality. The initial impact stems from the first two publications from the project ''Mainstreaming domestic and gender-based violence into sociology and the criminology of violence' The Sociological Review (2014), assisted by the production of a short research briefing note that communicated the main findings to a non-academic audience entitled 'The decline in the rate of domestic violence has stopped: removing the cap on repeat victimisation reveals more violence' and a short note in The Conversation 'Official statistics mask extent of domestic violence in the UK' and the British Journal of Criminology article, published in 2016 'Is violent crime increasing or decreasing? A new methodology to measure repeat attacks making visible the significance of gender and domestic relations'. 

We have a programme of speaking engagements that has taken the findings directly to academic, policy and practitioner audiences, delivering papers at over twenty different academic conferences (British Sociological Association 2014 and 2015; British Society of Criminology 2014; European Society of Criminology 2014, 2015 and 2016; American Society of Criminology 2014, 2015 and 2016; Lancaster University Violence and Society Research Days 2014 and 2015; Royal Statistical Society North West Local Group; Loughborough University Crime Drop meeting; FIRB 2015), technical, stakeholder and policy-maker meetings and events (UK National Statistics Office 2015; Crime Survey Users Group 2013 and 2014; UNESCO Gender Chairs Programme Colloquium 2014; Police Foundation conference, 2014; the European Parliament 2014; Security Lancaster 2013; London School of Economics 2014; Tacking Interpersonal Violence: A partnership Approach in the Age of Austerity seminar series, University of Sunderland 2015); participating in discussions and consultations with professional practitioners and stakeholders (UK Office for National Statistics; UK Statistics Authority; UK Home Office; Swiss Government). Publication of the article 'Mainstreaming domestic and gender-based violence into sociology and the criminology of violence' in The Sociological Review led, among other impacts, to an invitation to speak at a UK Statistics Authority conference on Better Statistics, Better Decisions on 9 June 2015. The audience comprised academics, professional practitioners, including from the Office for National Statistics, policy makers and press. The talk we delivered to this meeting 'Improving the Measurement of Domestic Violence' based on the article in the Sociological Review generated significant press interest, especially in the issue of capping the data used in the official analysis of national crime data. For example a piece in the Guardian on 6 June 2015 by Damien Gayle 'Violent Crime against Women &amp;quot;understated&amp;quot;' quotes our findings extensively. Articles appeared in a number of national newspapers and other online and print publications in June and July 2015, including: the BBC online, the Guardian online, the Mail online, the Telegraph online, and the Forensic and Policing Services Association on 9 June; The Guardian, The Times and The Telegraph on 10 June; ,The Telegraph and EVAW (End Violence against Women Coalition) on 11 June; The Police Professional and the Huffington Post UK on 12 June; the Mail online on 14 June; The Conversation and Lancaster University on 15 June; the Huffington Post UK on 19 June; and the Guardian online letters on 7 July. Additional Narrative Impact 10 March 2016 Following the publication of our second major article entitled 'Is violent crime increasing or decreasing? A new methodology to measure repeat attacks making visible the significance of gender and domestic relations' in the British Journal of Criminology in December 2015, our findings article were taken up by the British and international press, including The Guardian, The Guardian Online, Women's Hour. In the two weeks following the launch of the article, the findings were disseminated in twenty different media sources. The findings from this second article were also cited in Parliamentary Questions by Kate Green (Shadow Women and Equalities Minister) in Women and Equalities Questions on 14 January 2016. We are continuing our programme of speaking engagements which takes the findings directly to academic, policy and practitioner audiences, including: Women's Aid Conference 'Domestic Abuse: Understanding and Facing the Challenges Ahead'; and 'What do we know about Domestic Violence? New findings from the Crime Survey for England and Wales' Exploring Evidence-based Policing, N8 Policing Research Partnership. We continue to participate in further discussions and consultations with professional practitioners and stakeholders (UK Office for National Statistics; UK Statistics Authority; UK Home Office), including sitting on the Steering Committee for an ONS Review of Domestic Abuse Statistics and as invited experts to the Eurostat Task Force on the Development of a Survey on gender-based violence in the EU.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FB8A7AE2-93A4-442F-913F-C3D30349A3CB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560adca5e644f7.17501829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1.Substantive findings: 

The rate of violent crime is increasing. The rate of domestic violent crime is increasing. The rate of violent crime against women is increasing. The change from decline to increase occurred in 2008/9. It is important to distinguish between changes in the number of victims and the number of incidents. The category that is worst affected is that of the number of incidents of domestic violence against women. The answer to the question as to whether the rate of domestic violence is now increasing varies according to the decision taken on methodological alternatives, reported below. The ONS published data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (formerly the British Crime Survey) 'caps' the maximum number of incidents in a series at 5, so further recorded incidents are not included in official estimates. Analysis of CSEW for 2011/12 finds that when the cap is removed there are 60% more violent crimes: violent crime against women (70% increase) rather than men (50% increase) and on violent crime by domestic relations (70% increase) and acquaintances (100% increase) rather than by strangers (20% increase). 

2. Methodological finding: 

While counting all reported crimes is necessary in order to discover the extent to which violent crime is perpetrated by domestic relations, acquaintances or strangers, and against men or women, this creates difficulties for year-to-year comparisons by introducing some volatility due to small numbers of high frequency victims. We have developed the solution to this dilemma that avoids the current ONS practice of excluding the high frequencies of some victims. Our solution reduces both bias and volatility. This is to use three year moving averages. In addition we used advanced quantitative methods to analyse the raw data from the survey in order to produce a resolution to this dilemma. Among these was the use of a quasi-Poisson distribution to assess variability in count data, and the combination of this method with change-point detection methods to assess the statistical significance of variations over time in incidents and victims of domestic violence. 

3. Collaborations: 

The findings from our analysis have been used to inform other policy-relevant analyses in the Home Office, and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), through membership of the ONS Domestic Abuse Statistics Steering Group and the ONS Consultation on Methodology to Address High Frequency Repeat Victimization in Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates, and membership of the Eurostat Task Force on the Development of a Survey on gender-based violence in the EU. In addition there has been engagement with non-governmental organisations including Women's Aid, Safe Lives and Women against Violence Europe. This has extended the impact of the project and set up new avenues for collaborative research. There has been considerable interest in the research project from public interest bodies, such as the Police Foundation, and a new research agenda on violent crime is being co-constructed with Lancashire Constabulary.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our analysis of the survey is providing authoritative up to date data on domestic violence that is of use to the Home Office, Government Equalities Office, Police Foundation, European Institute for Gender Equality and non-governmental organisations developing policy in this field.
