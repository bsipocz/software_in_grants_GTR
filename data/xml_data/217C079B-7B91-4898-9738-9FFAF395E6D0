During development this epithelium must generate and organise all of the major cell types found in the mature organ, including the specialised sensory hair cells that detect the sound or movement, the non-sensory cells that support sensory cell function and the neurones that connect the organ to the central nervous system. The sensory cells detect the sound or movement stimuli and convert these into signals that are sent to the central nervous system via neurones. It is only when these signals are processed in the brain that they are perceived as sound or movement. Thus, the development of the neuronal connection between the inner ear and the central nervous system is crucial to the function of the inner ear and the perception of sound and movement. The generation of neuronal precursors is an early event during the development of the inner ear. Within the simple epithelial sheet a population of cells begin to develop as neurones. They migrate out of the epithelium into the surrounding tissue where they coalesce to form the cochlear-vestibular ganglion. Subsequently, they produce processes that grow back into the epithelium to connect to the sensory hair cells and towards the auditory and vestibular centres in the central nervous system. These events require dynamic changes in the cell-cell interactions that drive their release from the epithelium, support their migration and direct the growth of processes to the correct targets. Cellular interactions are controlled by numerous cell surface molecules that send signals into the cell when they bind to surface partners (ligands) expressed by neighbouring cells. The cell signalling results in changes in cell behaviour by, for example, causing the cell to be attracted to, or repelled from, the source of the ligand. One such family of cell surface molecules are the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) and their ligands the ephrins. Interactions between these molecules have previously been shown to have important roles in the organisation of the nervous system but their role in the early development of inner ear innervation has yet to be investigated. The aim of the work proposed here is to better understand the role of Eph/ephrin interactions in the development of inner ear innervation. We will focus on two events: first, the migration of neuronal precursors out of the early inner ear epithelium and second, the early growth of neuronal processes. To address these questions we will further develop an otic epithelial explant system that is currently being used in the lab in order to allow manipulation of the expression of Ephs and ephrins. The effect of changing the expression of these molecules on neuroblast migration and process formation will then be monitored in culture using timelapse microscopy and immunohistochemistry. These experiments will further our understanding of neuronal development of the inner ear and other organs derived from epithelia, such as the olfactory system. The development of a novel technique to manipulate expression of important molecules within a developing organ in culture will facilitate future studies into the development of these organs. In addition, these experiments will aid research into nerve regeneration following damage and potentially influence the development of cochlear implants by elucidating potential strategies to encourage neural growth towards implant electrodes, thereby, enhancing the implant performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The generation of neuroblasts within the otic epithelium is an early event in the development of the inner ear. Neuronal precursors detach from neighbouring cells and migrate out of the epithelium to form the cochlear-vestibular ganglion prior to growing processes back into the epithelium to innervate sensory hair cells. The mechanisms that control the cell-cell interactions involved in these migratory events have yet to be elucidated. The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands the ephrins have been shown to play a role in the development of innervation by directing neuronal growth. Moreover, preliminary data suggest that the expression of Ephs and ephrins is modulated during migration of otic neuroblasts. This proposal focuses on the role of Eph/ephrin interactions in the migration of otic neuroblasts and the early elaboration of neuronal processes during the development of the inner ear. Having first established precise Eph and ephrin expression patterns during neuroblast migration, we will manipulate the expression or function of these molecules in an otocyst explant preparation that has been optimised for these studies in our laboratory. The early otic epithelium is an integrated cell system that is ideal for in vitro study. Transient over- or mis-expression will be carried out by lipid-based transfection of the whole explant. Alternatively, explants derived from Ngn-1-GFP mice will allow targeting of constructs to individual neuroblast or epithelial cells within the tissue by microinjection. We will measure the effect of these manipulations by imaging the progress of migration in individual cells using timelapse microscopy and quantifying the number of migrating cells and migration distance at the tissue level. These techniques will also be used to investigate the role of Eph/ephrin interactions in the early production of neuronal processes. These data will further our understanding of neuronal development in the inner ear and other placodal organs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>338597</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>a) Identification of EphB1 receptor expression in a subset of neuroblasts within the neurogenic zone of the mammalian otocyst. Investigations into the role of EphB1 through both depletion of cell surface receptor and analysis of tissue from EphB1 knockout mice did not reveal a role for this Eph receptor in neuroblast segregation from the otocyst.
b) Identification of a hot spot of epithelial cell apoptosis within the neurogenic zone of the early otocyst. Apoptosis was shown to contribute to neuroblast migration out of the otocyst and, hence, to the early stages of cochlear-vestibular ganglion formation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These experiments will further our understanding of neuronal development of the inner ear and other organs derived from epithelia, such as the olfactory system.
