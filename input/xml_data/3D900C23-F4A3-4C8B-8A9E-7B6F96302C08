Some of these superconductors can carry large currents (exceeding one million amps per square centimetre of conductor) with negligible power dissipation. Alloys, especially NbTi and intermetallic compounds, especially Nb3Sn have been used since the late 1950s for generating high magnetic fields. Another useful and fascinating application of superconductivity is the production of miniature SQUID (superconducting quantum interference devices) that are uniquely sensitive to magnetic flux / less than a billionth of the Earth's magnetic field passing through a square centimetre.In 1986 the Nobel Prize winners Bednorz and Muller discovered a new class of cuprate superconductors. These contain copper oxide layers and are superconducting up to much higher temperatures than previous materials, well above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Their discovery triggered tremendous research activity aimed at understanding the origin of such unexpectedly high transition temperatures and at mastering these complex materials, that contain at least four elements, so that they can be used in practical devices. One of the best-known compounds, yttrium barium copper oxide has now been developed to the stage where km lengths of superconducting tape can be produced, as well as SQUID devices, working at liquid nitrogen temperatures.Despite intensive efforts by many highly committed scientists throughout the world there is still much to be done, both in understanding cuprate superconductivity and in harnessing their properties in useful devices. One of the highlights of the U.K. research effort over the past 15 years has been the unique experimental work Dr. J.W. Loram and colleagues in measuring the heat capacity of a several typical cuprate systems. The present proposal seeks to extend this work, helping to resolve several important and controversial theoretical questions, and at the same time obtaining useful empirical knowledge regarding the strength of the superconductivity in these compounds.The experimental technique will also be applied to another class of unusual electronic materials known as heavy fermion compounds, and substantial experimental know-how will be passed on to younger researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>32000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Further Impact via University of Cambridge</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>E7407332-70C8-472C-8793-CDD8DFB3BA8F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5edcd7485edcd75c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Many elements, alloys or intermetallic compounds become perfect conductors known as superconductors when cooled below a certain transition temperature, Tc. In 1986, Bednorz and Muller discovered a new class of high temperature superconductor (HTS), containing copper oxide layers, with Tc values well above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. One of these compounds, yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) has now been developed to the stage where km lengths of superconducting tape working at liquid nitrogen temperatures can be produced. The unique experimental work of Dr. J.W. Loram and colleagues in measuring the heat capacity of a several hole-doped cuprate HTS, including highly-cited work on the pseudogap is a highlight of the U.K. research effort over the past 20 years. The main achievements of the present research are as follows.

(i) Electron-doped cuprates, with a range of electron concentrations, were prepared in-house and clear superconducting anomalies were observed using our ratio technique. In contrast to earlier results from another group, their magnetic field-induced broadening is similar to hole-doped cuprates. The superfluid density was obtained from magnetisation measurements and by analysis of the heat capacity data after considerable effort in separating electronic and the large field-dependent magneticcontributions. Its variation with doping will be used to draw conclusions (Cavanna et al. to be published) regarding any pseudogap and the effects of Fermi surface reconstruction implied by recent high-field quantum oscillation (QO) studies.

(ii) Shortly after the grant was awarded, another class of HTS, the iron arsenide family with a maximum Tc above 50 K was discovered. Objectives were changed and the heat capacity of 11 polycrystalline samples of Ba1-xKxFe2As2, prepared at ETH Zurich, with x between 0 and 1 were measured in magnetic fields up to 13T and at temperatures from 2 to 350 K. This gave several striking new results, including how the strength of the superconductivity and the electron-electron interactions vary with x, and evidence for multiple superconducting gaps with unusual temperature and x-dependences (Storey et al. to be published).

(iii) Several projects connected with the pseudogap were completed. (a) Our earlier magnetic susceptibility data for lanthanum strontium cuprates with a few % Cu/Zn substitution were analysed, leading to a novel interpretation where non-magnetic Zn gives rise to low energy states in the pseudogap (Islam et al. 2010). (b) Measurements of thermoelectric power and magnetisation of polycrystalline samples of bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, with a few % Cu/M substitution, with M=Fe, Co, Mn or Li, synthesised in-house and single crystals grown at the University of Warwick, were analysed. The valency and magnetic moments of M and their effect on Tc, superfluid density and magnetic anisotropy were found (Benseman et al. 2011). This type of experiment can give evidence for a superconducting pairing mechanism associated with magnetic interactions. (c) The magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy of YBCO crystals were measured and analysed in terms of g-factor anisotropy, suggesting a fixed Cu valency of 2+, and onset temperatures for superconducting fluctuations were found for a wide range of hole concentrations (Kokanovic et al. 2012).

(iv) QOs, from a large Fermi surface containing ~1.2 holes per Cu ion, were observed (Bangura et al. 2010) for the overdoped single layer cuprate Tl:2201. Comparing their effective mass with angle-resolved photo-emission studies suggests an overall band-narrowing rather than mass enhancement associated with low energy bosonic excitations.

(v) Extensive know-how associated with the powerful heat capacity technique was transferred to a post-doctoral researcher (Storey) and a PhD student (Cavanna).

(vi) First steps towards miniaturising the heat capacity probe for use with small single crystals, were made and EPSRC Further Impact funding obtained.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The unique high resolution heat capacity equipment we have developed and used for several EPSRC funded projects over a number of years may eventually find wider application in research on and development of energy-related materials. We are continuing to work towards this goal.

Dr. J. G. Storey took up a research position in applied superconductivity at The MacDiarmid Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, P.O. Box 600, Wellington, New Zealand. We expect that the above results will be mostly of interest to other scientist working on high temperature superconductivity, especially those interested in understanding the pairing mechanism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F5EABDC4-D830-4C2A-B2BB-4E2ECD0CBDEC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6812107727.6879067762532e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A159CAA9-28D8-4568-96EE-39CCBB8F0E31</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pseudogap and doping-dependent magnetic properties of La_{2_x}Sr_{x}Cu_{1_y}Zn_{y}O_{4}</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Physical Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/caeb325da7332dac3cf304c2d4d125ed"><gtr:id>caeb325da7332dac3cf304c2d4d125ed</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Raihana Shams Islam (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_160595723413772c58</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70BD229F-E8B8-4978-893B-CAAA252624A1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fermi surface and electronic homogeneity of the overdoped cuprate superconductor
