Superimposed upon the DNA sequence, chromatin structure provides an additional layer of heritable information that we are just beginning to read and understand. All cells in our body contain an identical genotype but a single egg will give rise to numerous cell phenotypes. By controlling accessibility to DNA and subsequently controlling gene expression, chromatin is fundamental in this epigenetic process. Boveri, the father of cancer genetics, described a generalized disturbance of chromosomal organization and nuclear structure that distinguished cancer cells from normal cells. Although his writing preceded our understanding of DNA, his thoughts were based on his observation of widespread disruption of what we would call chromatin today. CTCF and its new identified partner cohesin are believed to organise higher order chromatin structure in the cell and therefore to play a central role in the processes controlling gene expression and cell differentiation. Both mutations of cohesin and CTCF cause severe developmental disorders, including cancers. Pascal Lefevre has been studied modification of the chromatin structure associated with cell differentiation process in macrophage differentiation during almost 10 years. He has recently described a new mechanism leading to abrogation of the CTCF/cohesin complex repressive effect on gene expression after macrophages inflammatory response. Using available database, he identified new CTCF/cohesin binding sites at the vicinity of genes essential for macrophages differentiation and function. The goal of this proposal is to understand the effect of aberrant expression of the CTCF/cohesin complex on the expression of these genes by using primary macrophages in culture. With both CTCF and cohesin proteins ubiquitously expressed, this project will also participate to increase our understanding of the role of this complex in general cell differentiation processes as well as in the development of malignant tissues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal aims to determine the role of the CTCF/cohesin complex in the regulation of myeloid genes and thus in the control of cell fate decisions in the myeloid lineage. CTCF, a candidate tumour-suppressor gene, has emerged as a main player in controlling chromatin structure and function. CTCF, for CCCTC-binding factor, is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein highly conserved from Drosophila to human and identified as the vertebrate insulator protein. These insulators are DNA elements thought to partition the genome into independently regulated domains. The molecular basis of insulation seems to be linked to several long-range physical interactions between different portions of the chromatin fibre. By reporting co-localisation between CTCF and the cohesin complex, several studies may have lifted the veil on the mechanism mediating CTCF insulator function. Cohesin is a large ring-shaped protein complex thought to trap pairs of replicated chromosomes, known as sister chromatids, for segregation during the nuclear-division phase of the cell cycle. If cohesin rings can hold two sister chromatids, they might also be able to link a CTCF-binding site to other sequences or to another CTCF binding sites, some distance away along the chromosome. Moreover, without a doubt, the discovery of CTCF-cohesin interaction has not only provided a new perception on insulation, but also opened new perspectives about CTCF other multiple functions. At the chicken lysozyme locus, CTCF is associated with silencing. Our recent studies established that CTCF recruits cohesin at this silencer and that full transcriptional activation of this gene in macrophage correlates with a transcription dependent loss of CTCF/cohesin. By analysing available databases, we identified new CTCF binding sites at the vicinity of key regulators of myeloid differentiation as well as LPS-inducible genes and established cohesin co-localisation with CTCF at these binding sites. We want to understand how the presence of CTCF/cohesin affects the expression of these genes and whether this, in turn, affects the differentiation and the function of granulocytes and macrophages. Using myeloid cell lines and in vitro differentiation of mouse primary macrophages, we plan to analyse CTCF/cohesin interaction with the selected binding sites and the effect of aberrant expression of both protein on the expression of these genes, during myeloid differentiation. With emerging evidence pointed to the role of CTCF deregulation in the epigenetic imbalance in cancer, we also want to investigate the link between CTCF and DNA methylation in our system.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>370692</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B602B88-2C9E-411B-8811-C176D11FA192</gtr:id><gtr:title>CTCF depletion alters chromatin structure and transcription of myeloid-specific factors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of molecular cell biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11051aa58fa893d99378a353608c0731"><gtr:id>11051aa58fa893d99378a353608c0731</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ouboussad L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1759-4685</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f93b93bb35dee4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6D7BF3D-4F16-4F54-801D-5DB392432391</gtr:id><gtr:title>Heterochromatin protein 1 gamma and I?B kinase alpha interdependence during tumour necrosis factor gene transcription elongation in activated macrophages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f838be0d4880bce8ec0b7f8f914c3ec"><gtr:id>8f838be0d4880bce8ec0b7f8f914c3ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thorne JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_13407_27_22649058</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C587E3CB-4931-46A8-A72D-B0BA5F4430B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>A NF-?B-dependent dual promoter-enhancer initiates the lipopolysaccharide-mediated transcriptional activation of the chicken lysozyme in macrophages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e0eeec41945b341efdbcfea3c7ee745"><gtr:id>5e0eeec41945b341efdbcfea3c7ee745</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Witham J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_13407_27_23533622</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0801215</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
