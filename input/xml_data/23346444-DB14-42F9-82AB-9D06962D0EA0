The condition is commonly only partially responsive to treatment, and though hearing voices may be a florid symptom of the disorder it is the cognitive (intellectual) impairments accompanying schizophrenia which best predict outcome. We want to know what brain systems are responsible for the inability to act that is seen in many people with schizophrenia and we wish to understand the nature of the biological abnormality in those systems. We are able to examine grey and white matter function and structure in the frontal lobes of the brain using technologies available at our centre. Crucially, we wish to discover whether deficits in the structure of the frontal lobe limit the ability of the brain to benefit from therapies used in schizophrenia (hence our use of the phrase: anatomy as destiny). If abnormalities of frontal lobe structure limit response to treatment then this will have implications for future treatment strategies applied to schizophrenia. Some patients may not respond to any conventional form of treatment (because of structural deficits). Some drug trials may not be comparable because the patients included have different potentials for recovery. The suite of methods that we are able to apply to this problem will allow us to provide systematic and coherent information to help answer these questions. The applicant is a branch-member of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship and, as well as the scientific dissemination of research findings, we are accustomed to presenting data to sufferers and their carers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Objective: We wish to examine the behavioural, functional anatomical, and structural correlates of avolition in people with schizophrenia. We hypothesise that avolition will be associated with reduced novelty-generation, reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortical BOLD response, grey matter volume and white matter anisotropy at two time points (12 months apart). We also hypothesise that those patients exhibiting greater functional improvement over 12 months will exhibit less severe structural deficits (when first studied). Hence, we hypothesise that grey and white matter structural deficits will constrain possible functional response in people affected by schizophrenia. Methodology: We will examine prefrontal function and structure in 100 people with DSM IV schizophrenia. We will use behavioural tasks known to engage prefrontal systems, inside and outside the MR scanner, and we will assess symptoms and social functioning with SANS and SBS rating scales. Prefrontal functional response will be measured using BOLD fMRI; and grey and white matter structure will be examined using voxel-based morphometry and DT MRI respectively. Design: A naturalistic cohort study. Behavioural, functional and structural anatomical data will be entered into within-group correlational designs and analysed together with blind symptom ratings of the patients studied. Internal validation will be achieved by independent analyses of within-group data at each of 2 time-points, 12 months apart. A within-subject design (ANOVA) will be used to examine change in symptomatology over 12 months. Extent of functional improvement (as indexed by negative symptomatology and social function) will be ranked and entered into an analysis designed to test our second hypothesis (above): that subjects exhibiting the greatest structural impairment at first assessment will exhibit the least functional change over 12 months. Exploitation: Our findings will inform knowledge of the biology of schizophrenia with respect to some of its most debilitating symptoms. If structural deficits really do constrain possible recovery (i.e., if anatomy is destiny) then this may have profound implications for future treatment strategies (and future therapeutic-trials).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2003-10-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>663096</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Radio 3 Free Thinker 2008</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>0193FBD1-CB1C-4476-902B-761440CD7CB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper before a public audience at the Free Thinking Festival in Liverpool on 1st November 2008 and my paper will be broadcast as an episode of Night Waves on BBC Radio 3 in due course

We have ongoing contacts with other academic centres and also industrial partners. The dissemination of the main body of this project's data will follow when we have completed data acquisition (in December 2008) whereupon we shall be able to compute our primary outcomes. We have not done this so far as we do not wish to engage in so-called 'salami publications'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>78F372381EC</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Health professionals</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2006,2007,2008,2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Rethink charity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>729375FC-BBD4-4528-82F8-71FF68A9141B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a member of the local group I have presented on more than one occasion, details of our MRC work.
