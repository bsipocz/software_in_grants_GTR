Pregnant women living in countries where malaria is prevalent are more susceptible to malaria infection than non-pregnant women, and prompt treatment and access to effective measures to prevent malaria depends on women having access to good quality antenatal care services. International donors and regional leaders have recently renewed their commitment to reaching more pregnant women with effective malaria prevention interventions. It is known that pregnant women who regulalry use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) throughout pregnancy and receive at least two doses of antimalarial drugs during the second and third trimesters (Intermittent Preventive Treatment or IPT) are less likely to acquire malaria or suffer the serious consequences of infection, which can be fatal.
Malaria control programmes have struggled to implement simple and effective interventions like IPT or ITNs, in part because they have failed to take account of community and pregnant women?s reactions and responses to the interventions. International donors heavily promote these important public health interventions to try and increase coverage in communities affected by malaria, but the real challenge lies in improving implementation to encourage uptake of ITNs and IPT by pregnant women.
This research will bring together all the available evidence on barriers and facilitators to pregnant women?s access and use of ITNs and IPT, women?s acceptability of the interventions, and factors influencing their uptake. Researchers based at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine together with colleagues working in malaria control in Africa will do this by using a method called research synthesis that summarises results from across multiple studies. Synthesis makes research findings more accessible by bringing a body of evidence to policy makers in a more succinct format. The benefits to malaria control programmes in Africa of a critical and systematic summary of this research are obvious; equipped with evidence of what is important to pregnant women and communities, the design and implementation of programmes to improve the use of IPT and ITNs in pregnancy could be made more effective.
Increasing the number of women using ITNs and taking preventive doses of antimalarial treatment during pregnancy is critical to maternal and child health and survival, and in achieving millennium development goals 4, 5 and 6.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Malaria infection in pregnancy is of particular concern to public health workers in endemic areas because of the serious consequences for mothers and infants. Effective preventive interventions including insecticide treated nets and intermittent preventive treatment can help reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy only if women have access to, and routinely use them. Qualitative research is central to understanding pregnant women?s uptake of these interventions, their acceptability, and the various influences on health behaviour. 

Synthesis of qualitative research is of emerging importance in global health; it can provide evidence of what is important to pregnant women and communities and can help understand what works in terms of implementing malaria prevention programmes. But the methods for synthesising qualitative research are still in development, and there are important methodological questions that need to be addressed. This research aims to a) delineate to policy makers and programme managers: what is currently known about social, cultural and behavioural aspects of women?s uptake of malaria in pregnancy interventions, what gaps in knowledge remain and the agenda for future qualitative research in this area; and b) contribute to the methodological development of the thematic approach to synthesising qualitative research. 
We will do this by 1) conducting two systematic reviews to identify the social, cultural, behavioural and structural factors influencing women?s uptake of interventions to prevent malaria in pregnancy; and 2) evaluating two techniques that address current methodological concerns in the synthesis of qualitative research.

This research has the potential to help various stakeholders in malaria control to better understand the implementation process in terms of barriers and facilitators to uptake of treatment and preventive strategies. The benefits to malaria control programmes in Africa of a critical and systematic summary of thisearch are obvious; armed with evidence of what is important to pregnant women and communities, the design and implementation of programmes to improve both coverage and use of Intermittent Preventive Treatment and Insecticide Treated Nets in malaria endemic areas could be made more effective.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>179625</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>26130</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>UNICEF contract no. 43113551</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>United Nations (UN)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1C05EC76-14D0-440F-8181-26C8FDA8D99F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>jL8TfhKUi4C0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9125</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>HQ/Reproductive Health &amp;amp;
