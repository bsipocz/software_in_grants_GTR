Inequality</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K00283X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Little is known about the geography of Internet use and online participation in Britain, although there is evidence of major geographic inequalities in access and use (eg Internet use in Scotland is 20 percentage points below the East Midlands).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will produce the first detailed geographic estimates of Internet use. Specifically it will combine the Oxford Internet Survey (OxIS) with the census and several special-purpose datasets on important metrics of Internet use and participation (eg tweets, Wikipedia articles, photo uploads).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will investigate the geography of several types of use. First is simple use or non-use of the Internet. There are many ways of interacting with, using, and communicating through the Internet, so the project will also examine online buying and selling, social networking, banking and finance, information and entertainment seeking, politics and communication.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Internet is a unique medium in that it allows ordinary users to create and distribute content. The project will thus explore online content production in the form of blogs, personal websites, uploading music or videos, and others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will use maps of the geographic distribution of use as well as multivariate, inferential studies that predict the geographic inequalities in digital Britain.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have extensive benefits outside the academic community: 

-- Government policy-makers who often need more detailed knowledge about the geography of online inequality because this is fundamental to understanding issues such as social inequalities, political participation or future economic growth. The specific benefits of the proposed project will develop new understandings the geographic distribution of inequality which researchers and practitioners alike can apply and implement as techniques for data collection and models for analysis. 

-- The Internet has been a disruptive innovation. It has changed the way that information flows and created dynamic new growth areas. Growth in the British economy is increasingly dependent on the ability effectively to exploit the opportunities offered by the Internet. To the extent that the Internet is crucial for economic development, then mapping inequalities in Internet access will reveal communities and regions which will participate in the new digital economy and those which will lag behind. The project will show which areas benefit and where digital divides are being created. This is important for future economic growth and for jobs. 

-- The project's results will be disseminated to researchers from government, business and other sectors. The workshops and the project website will provide new information to help understand the full impact of the Internet on the geography of British economic, social and political life. 

--The project website will be maintained by OII IT staff beyond the end of the project so that interested researchers and officials can view webcasts, download presentation slides, working papers and data, read blog entries and otherwise benefit from the project. Through the website the impact of the project will continue for years after the end of the funding.

-- The Internet has produced completely new business models for the music and newspaper industries, but these are only two examples of the much larger picture of the disruption caused by the Internet. For politicians, it offers new ways to reach voters and new ways to campaign and for government agencies it establishes new models for reaching their constituencies. The proposed project will help businesses as well as local and national government to identify who benefits and where digital divides are being created. Maps supply tools and data to analyze relationships between local areas and they improve our understanding of how information and knowledge are obtained and shared - all these will benefit a wider public and knowledge professionals alike.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government Digital Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Government Digital Services</gtr:description><gtr:id>5EBF874E-D9D3-4094-97D6-BAD3748D337C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is still ongoing so the outputs have not formally emerged.

Some places where conventional wisdom suggests should have low levels of Internet use like Cornwall and Scotland, are not unusually low. Despite its reputation, Cornwall is actually above the UK average for Internet use. The lowest levels of Internet use are in the Northeast region. Cities typically have higher levels of Internet use than the surrounding countryside, but this is not true in the Northeast. Central Wales also shows low levels of Internet use. The highest levels of Internet use are in London; no surprise there. But Internet use in London varies widely from borough to borough. Some boroughs show Internet use that is 10-15 percentage points higher than others. This shows that geography plays a major role in Internet use, a fact that was not previously known.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have created a dataset containing estimates of Internet use at the level of the Census Output Area. This can be aggregated up to any higher level of administrative geography. It could be used by London Boroughs, or Metropolitan Districts in Glasgow to assess their level of Internet use, in comparison to neighboring areas. Since high levels of Internet use are closely tied to the availability of well-paying jobs and economic growth, this would give administrators insight into the economic prospects for their area.

Findings from this study are being used for segmentation purposes by Government Digital Services to support the government's Digital Inclusion agenda.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>513677E2-BF5F-40CF-90FD-74593D14276E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f7af4911536.68549322</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=123</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Ofcom broadband</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>448F7CF9-DD8F-4706-85C6-2D8C618B8ABF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ofcom will use our estimates of Internet use in different geographic areas combined with their broadband availability and speed data in the same geographic areas to assess the impact of broadband on Internet takeup.

This will provide a more sophisticated measure of digital inclusion than currently provided by ONS. The new measure will create a common language to discuss digital inclusion in the UK. The new measure will provide a standard of best practice, thereby raising the overall level of sophistication in measuring digital inclusion. I am participating because measuring geographic segmentation is an important component. I am using the research funded by this grant. Better measurement will make it easier for the government to see what it is doing well and where it could improve. The result will be an increase in digital inclusion in the UK.
