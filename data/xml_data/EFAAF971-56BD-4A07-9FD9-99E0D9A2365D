Their relatively high manufacturing cost and the difficulty of scaling the manufacturing process is an intrinsic feature of their energy-intensive fabrication process. In contrast, non-conventional PVs based on organic semiconductors can be processed from solution using high-volume roll-to-roll printing technologies, offering the possibility of large area devices being fabricated on flexible substrates at very low cost. Unfortunately at present, organic PV devices are characterized by prohibitively low external power efficiencies (&amp;lt; 6%). Closing the gap in efficiency between organic and inorganic PV devices is a significant challenge / one which will require a full microscopic understanding of the processes that currently limit organic PV efficiency. The most promising organic PV devices are currently based on solution-cast blends of conjugated polymers doped with fullerene derivatives. Relatively little is however known regarding the role of the self-assembled nanoscale morphology of such systems on their operational efficiency. In this proposal, we seek to develop a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the self-assembly processes by which nanoscale structure arises within such PV applicable materials. In particular we propose to study the evolution of nanoscale phase-separation during film casting using X-ray scattering. We will also utilize a range of complementary microscopy techniques ranging from environmental scanning electron microscopy, to time-resolved near field microscopy. The combination of such techniques will permit us to develop a complete picture of film structure from molecular to microscopic length-scales. Our proposed project draws together some of the UK's leading polymer scientists and technologists, with our goal being to significantly advance the understanding of the processes that limit organic PV device performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Reading</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Reading - Hard And Soft Nanomaterial Films</gtr:description><gtr:id>87B6FB85-A486-4BC9-A177-38AB7236EC38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First paper is with Langmuir for review currently, PhD thesis will follow</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461f2de624a26.15566787-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>New thin film types generated for study by GiSAXS as well as in house measurements.

They encounter researchers discussing their work, and are able to see the potential future impact of the research activity, for example, the potential applications of solar technology. The beamline takes part in open days for the public and for schools. Events provoke discussion with visitors, and raise awareness of current research For the beamline. Families often bring children to the facility, who are exposed to a range of science and engineering careers outside of the usual lab environment.

The open days at Diamond aim to change the perception of scientists, and how different areas of science interact and support one another. Feedback is regularly received that visitors encounter new areas of science which they were previously unaware of, which they now express an interest in. Teacher feedback of our schools events reports that visiting the facility increases engagement with their subjects and enables students to consider careers in science. I22 regularly participates in the days relating the work carried out in both grant held projects such as the OPV project and Pressure Cell Project as well as other User driven science projects carried out on the beamine.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461e8ee8609f8.82191628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Events/Inside-Diamond---Public-Open-Days.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006,2007,2008,2009,2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RSC Public Lecture - Harnessing the Light Fantastic!</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4658448-919B-41E7-9F44-183ADD75A202</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk provoked good debate afterwards on the energy policy we are taking and how science could play a role in developing solutions.

As part of this research (and via other RCUK projects that ran in parallel), Sheffield set up the spin-out company Ossila. This company helped to commercialise the know-how developed within the Sheffield group and continues to help other researchers working in the same area by accelerating their research through the provision of a range of specially designed consumer products.

While scientific output was the primary outcome for both Diamond and the academic groups in the collaboration, an additional benefit from this grant was in a better understanding of the technical and scientific requirements for user experimentation in this field.

These findings were used to prepare an internal proposal for continuation funding, to the sum of &amp;pound;350,000, for additional GiSAXS infrastructure on beamline I22. The ultimate aim of this follow-up funding is to allow, not only the original collaboration to improve their data collection, but expand the technique to new user communities including those working on inorganic deposited thin films and biological lipid bilayer systems.

The GiSAXS capability described above has now been implemented on I22 and is available to the User Community comprising, data collection in GiSAXS and GiWAXS simultaneously, beamstops for direct, transmission and specular beam plus a 6-degree of freedom sample platform for thin film measurement and annealing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>13334808-19DB-448A-843C-E40CA2503E35</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460bf373b56a5.14326275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Diamond's responsibility to this grant was to provide the infrastructure necessary to take detailed measurements of polymer thin films growing in-situ and to develop protocols for subsequent data collection.

The work provides design rules for the development of materials and the ways in which such materials should be processed.
