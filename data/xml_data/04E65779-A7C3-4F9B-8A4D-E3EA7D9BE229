technology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K005545/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The overall aim of this project is to help educational institutions, primarily in the Further Education sector, to adapt to a challenging and changing learning technology environment. Effective pedagogical innovation with technology has the most immediate effect on improving the quality and scale of learners' experience and attainment. Our methodology is therefore to support the teaching community in learning collaboratively about how to optimise the use of technologies, so they can respond more rapidly to the needs and demands of their students and potential students.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project builds on an interactive digital tool, the Learning Designer, developed by ESRC-EPSRC/TEL funded and BIS-funded projects, to support innovative design of teaching and learning, making it easier for teachers to incorporate technology and exchange their ideas with others. Teachers welcome the tool as a way of building the community knowledge of how to optimise technology enhanced learning. Our aim now is to increase its impact by embedding it as part of the professional teacher?s toolkit, enabling the teaching community to express and exchange their proven innovations in teaching and learning.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The motivation for this project is the need to improve the learning experience and attainment of post-16 students, both for their personal benefit and to enable them to contribute to the knowledge economy. Educational institutions and the teaching community know the importance of deploying technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of teaching and learning - this is reflected in many policy documents - but have had little investment, in their time and personal development, for working out how to do this. The technology evolves rapidly, and investment has been targeted more at hardware and software than at R&amp;amp;D for optimising its use. Our research has shown that an interactive learning design tool can support teachers in focusing on the effectiveness and efficiency of their teaching, and in sharing their best ideas. Now we set out to develop this shared community knowledge of how to improve teaching and learning.

Our aim is to help teachers help learners.

The principal tangible output will be a public library of shared learning designs created by the teachers in our partner schools and colleges. To collect and organise these designs the project will use an interactive design tool developed by an earlier ESRC-EPSRC-funded project. The Learning Designer provides a unique methodology for building a public library of learning designs because it helps teachers design, analyse and organise them in terms of the pedagogies and technologies they wish to use. By adopting, improving and sharing their best ideas, teachers can more easily discover how best to use technology to give their students an efficient and effective learning experience. 

To achieve this, the project team has planned activities on several fronts: 
 &amp;gt; dissemination of the idea behind the Learning Designer: i.e. that teachers can innovate with new technology more effectively if they build their knowledge collaboratively;
 &amp;gt; co-development with central staff in colleges to integrate the tool and the developing library of learning designs into the normal teaching-learning process;
 &amp;gt; collaboration with teaching staff to assist them in using the Learning Designer to generate, test, and share their best ideas, and to build on other teachers' ideas;
 &amp;gt; co-development of the public library of learning designs, to ensure that alternative designs relevant to what they are working on in the Learning Designer can be found and presented to teachers at the point of need;
 &amp;gt; updating of the advice and guidance in the tool to link teacher-designers to evidence and research relevant to their current pedagogic decisions at the point of need;
 &amp;gt; upgrading of the Learning Designer in response to further user requirements, to ensure it blends easily into individual and institutional practice.

These activities aim to contribute four types of impact:
 * Academic impact, in the form of a collection of learning designs structured according to theory-based concepts of pedagogy, providing a well-organised body of evidence about how teachers conceptualise their teaching, useful for further theory development in the under-theorised area of technology-based pedagogies.
 * Professional impact, in the form of a new type of methodology to develop teachers' professionalism in the skill of optimising the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning in a way that is more likely to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness of student learning and attainment.
 * Economic impact, in the form of help for educational institutions to adapt to a challenging and changing environment by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their use of technology for teaching and learning.
 * Societal impact, in the form of graduates who have been schooled in the use of new technologies for effective independent learning, who are more likely to include this capability in their continuing use of technology for work and leisure.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99052</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Singapore, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research International Advisory Panel</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACD00D69-E7C0-41AD-A756-F8564937CD71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Revision of the Research Strategy 2016 - 2020, for the Singapore Workforce Development Agency</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b8b07cf270.15977221-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Organisation of the meeting of experts, support to the meetings, write-up of reports to the Ministry.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Expert advice on learning with digital technology in particular, and

It does not especially make use of Google tools in any way, but could be linked to their on-the-ground strategy for improving local use of technology in schools, which is why they were interested.

The follow-up was a request for a further meeting to discuss collaboration. Promising avenues emered at the meeting, but progress on taking it further is intermittent, and seems to be derailed by other pressures. The connection remains, and will be used for promulgating further versions of the tool.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>556c05ab131617.96896309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Positioning your institution's global presence: Marketing</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DF86331-F3B9-482C-B738-E52B6B548653</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited plenary talk at the Higher Education Show, Olympia, Oct 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c787d802c8.61536126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://he-show.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Digital Leadership in Higher Education'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0AAC73B0-0A11-4F5B-84DB-B2DE55CF48EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote as interview, via videoconference, for Shanghai Open University International Conference on Leadership and Innovation for the Future in ODL, November 2016, followed by synchronous discussion</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c995266091.44184628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Professionalising teaching innovation in the digital age'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A26D8F00-B1B1-4EAA-928F-173C786F8EF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote at the Association of Medical Education Conference, Barcelona, August 2016.

It covers topics such as how best to use the technology to evaluate what works for learners, and how to track their learning; how technology can help with some of the main challenges tp the sector, e.g. by offering more flexible learning, encouraging more independent learning skills, and by sharing and working together perhaps we can also reduce the costs of innovation. In the final week it looks at how the educational organisation embraces this kind of change, and how participants can work with colleagues to make blended learning work most effectively.
The course runs wholly online, providing 4 study hours per week for 3 weeks. Activities include short videos, quizzes, discussions, and design activities that link to the Learning Designer tools.
More than 10,000 participants were enrolled in the course during the three runs of the course in 2016.
During the period when the Learning Designer tools were being used, usage peaked at more than 2000 in one day, and there were more than 20,000 unique visits to the website over a 4-week period, with 15,000 return visits, showing that the software continued to be used. Comments in the discussion forums were very enthusiastic about the prospect of using the tools, and sharing them with colleagues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb5153819946.00291679</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-embedding-practice/1/steps/47766#fl-comments</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Rethinking the profession of teaching as a design science'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46A1B645-7345-49EC-B70E-87AC35C33D74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote presentation at the Int'l Conference on Teaching with Learning Technology, Singapore, March 2016

This is a follow-on project from ES/F042175/1.

Use of the tools developed within the LDSE project (the Learning Designer and the Course Resource Appraisal Modeller) was established during the project, and has since increased. The aim of both is to foster the building of academic community knowledge that optimises the use of technology in education.

In the year since the end of the project (31 May 2014) the Learning Designer tool has continued to increase its impact measures, with steady growth in visitors over each previous quarter of 19%, 46%, 32%, 73% to 60,000 unique visitors over the year, with 34% returning. There have been 233,000 page views over the year.
In the 10 months since, there have been 401,821 page views, 111,000 unique visitors, with 38% returning.

By the end of the BCK project the Learning Design Directory had collected 117 publicly available designs, including 48 reviews for teachers to share. These have now increased to 320 designs.

The Course Resource Appraisal Modeller (CRAM), also developed from the LDSE project, received additional HEIF funding to assist with software development. It is a downloadable interactive tool for modelling the learning benefits and teaching costs for a conventional, blended, or online course. This is to support lecturers who are innovating with technology in their courses in developing viable business models and best use of technology for learning. In the 9 months following its launch it acquired more than 1200 users, of whom 500 were in the US, as the largest user. Users currently stand at 4,200 of whom 1,400 are in the US.

Current and planned beneficiaries 
A UCL institutional project to understand teacher workload for online and blended learning courses (CRAM), and to integrate the tool with the UCL Course Costing and Pricing model.
A UCL institutional project to develop a guided online support process to enable academic teams to design engaging and effective blended and online modules and programmes (Learning Designer).
A set of Masterclasses, and workshops for the Ministry of Education in Singapore, on the use of these tools for designing online learning products.

Value to users
? The tools are creating community knowledge through shared development of lesson plans, patterns, designs and course plans.
? They are increasing teacher professionalism through building community knowledge of exemplars of pedagogical effectiveness, and of the teaching costs and learning benefits of scaling up online.
? The design tool was used as the basis of an activity within a Coursera-based MOOC for primary teachers, which itself brought over 1000 users to the tool. It has now been used by other EU teams in their MOOCs, as well as in a FutureLearn MOOC on Blended Learning for Vocational Education and Training.
? There were 92 comments in the associated forum, all highly appreciative, in a context where few forums would receive more than 100 contributions.
Both the Learning Designer and the Course Resource Appraisal Modeller have been used for activities within the Blended Learning Essential MOOCs now running on the FutureLearn platform.
This year, the average daily unique users for the Learning Designer is 580, and page views &amp;gt;2000.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A688B243-8EB0-4BF4-BB2D-FF927E5F05D9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545bf34766f185.35883594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The significant contribution of this project is the creation of a new type of tool for helping teachers, in all sectors, to use digital technologies effectively for innovative teaching and learning. We have built and tested an online learning design app for teachers, in all sectors, called the 'Learning Designer'. 

These are the main features that make this design tool an important innovation:
? It elicits specific properties of each stage in a sequence of teaching and learning activities, and can therefore provide the user with feedback on the overall nature of the student experience, and the duration of the design in comparison with the intended learning time. 
? It prompts critical reflection on the user's pedagogy, their inclusion of a wider range of pedagogical approaches than they normally use, and promotes the use of digital learning analytics as a way of testing the efficacy of each design.
? Because the learning design is created as a digital object, it can then be shared locally or on the online directory of designs for other teachers to access, adopt or adapt to their context.
? The website enables users to submit, review, revise and categorise each other's designs, so that the teaching community gradually builds these designs as shared knowledge of effective designs for learning, with or without technology.

The principal discovery of the project is that members of the teaching community in all sectors, and from many countries, are enthusiastic users and contributors to the website. The tool inaugurates a new way of building teaching community knowledge of effective use of learning technologies. It provides the means for design research collaboration across groups of teachers within and between countries and disciplines.

Because of its nature, the design tool can also be used as a research tool to help in understanding how teachers theorise and articulate their pedagogy. From evaluation of workshops and courses for teachers using the tool, our further findings are that: 
? teachers frequently underestimate the duration of the learning time needed for their design, until they use the Learning Designer, and they become much more careful about how long students need for different activities; 
? the CRAM modelling process makes teachers more clearly aware of how they spend their own time, and the reality of the time needed for different types of course;
? teachers provide detailed pedagogic reviews, in the Online Challenges from which clear pedagogic principles are emerging; 
? the Challenge events are important for eliciting reviews, without which they are rarely offered, just as in the journal review process;
? designs that begin in one subject area or sector or country can be adapted successfully for very different subjects, sectors, and countries;
? it is possible to use the tool, in conjunction with a large-scale online collaborative course, for aggregating teachers' evidence of learning outcomes and effectiveness of a particular learning design or teaching method that has been used in a wide range of implementation contexts; 
? for many practising teachers the use of these tools makes them aware of how little time they have for innovation, experimentation or professional development with respect to their teaching - this is not valued by their institutions, and the teachers we have worked with in all sectors are acutely aware of the difficulty of being able to invest time initially even if it is expected to deliver returns on more students and higher attainment in the longer run
? managers are interested in the CRAM tool, although finance managers believe they already understand how to cost teaching, building on their knowledge of how it has always been costed, and on what they have to provide for HEFCE and HESA; there is very little appreciation at senior level of the reality of the cost of teaching.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Already taken forward by others:
The learning design tool has been used as follows:
- three 'international learning design challenge' events, with &amp;gt;300 participants.
- teacher training and CPD courses run within UCL-IOE
- in a Couresera MOOC on 'ICT in Primary Education', 2013-17
- as the basis for a new VLE for schools developed by a company (ASTRI) in Hong Kong. 
 
Collaborative uses:
The Learning Designer and the CRAM tool have been built into a project funded by Ufi Charitable Trust to develop online CPD courses for the FE and Skills sector on 'blended learning', which also attract teachers from the HE and Schools sectors. During the first 3 runs of the two courses (Nov 2015 - Oct 2016) the courses had &amp;gt; 20,000 active participants (with &amp;gt;40,000 registered), from &amp;gt; 150 countries. All the comments on these tools were highly favourable.

It should be developed professionally as an open source pedagogical design front-end for any VLE a teacher may be using. The current institutional project will assist this.

The Learning Designer tool has been embedded in several research proposals, for the EU Erasmus call, for an ESRC-DFID call, and for the current ESRC Centre for Global Higher Education at UCL-IOE, for which we will study the viability of collaborative learning MOOCs for CPD to teachers and lecturers.

There have been many invitations to join EU projects where the Learning Designer is used as a research tool, and for collaborations with other universities, or with schools. Unfortunately many of these small-scale collaborations are not viable as they do not provide sufficient opportunities for further development, and we can only work on large-scale impact to attract future funding. There is no funding for the development of a user community itself.

A new collaboration with Beijing Normal University has been funded by their Advanced Innovation Center for Future Education to develop a teacher development course on the use of blended learning for problem-solving, at school level. The Learning Designer is the basis for the design and peer review activities on the course.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DC5EDFD-965D-4562-AB14-1A4E2F6D9859</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bb7e4a9ed55.28771643</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://buildingcommunityknowledge.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Scoping Report for an FE Online Academy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8521A30D-338E-41C6-AA52-28F8976A7D87</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>556c08dc814037.49149045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Blended Learning CPD for Vocational Teachers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B24586EF-8A02-48BD-96C4-DD07EC817585</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reach in terms of enrolments
Over 35,000 registrations for the two courses (Blended Learning Essentials,:Getting Started and Embedding Practice), run on FutureLearn Over 54% of participants were from the UK, 56% from the VET sector and almost 60% are teachers or trainers. With further promotion, and the influence of the early participants in these three initial runs, we can expect that in time the courses could reach a high proportion of the intended workforce.

Impact on participants
Participants enrol on MOOCs such as BLE with a range of personal criteria for success, but completion rates for the courses (17%) have performed well in comparison with similar FutureLearn courses (12%). 
Participants' attitudes to blended learning were positive from the outset and post-course surveys indicated that they grew even more enthusiastic as a result of the course. 
Course surveys reported a drop from 49% to 25% of participants who felt nervous about using blended learning, and an increase from 39% to 64% who felt confident about using it appropriately.

Participant Engagement and Activity
Active engagement achieved across all parts of the course, including over 40,000 comments.
The majority of course steps have in excess of an 80% visit to completion conversion rate. 
Take-up of the accreditation pathways is also positive, 15% opted to buy a statement of participation and the CMALT pilot, run by ALT, was full. 

Impact on Teaching Practice
Pre- and post-course surveys show that: almost 90% of survey respondents note awareness of tools and technologies to support blended learning after the course compared to 45% beforehand. 
BLE has helped improve participants' confidence and attitudes towards blended learning: only 12% of respondents in the post-course survey now view their 'limited knowledge' of blended learning as a 'serious barrier' to using it, a significant drop from 56% in the pre-course survey.
The qualitative analysis of peer assessment, discursive activities and reflective questioning on the platform provides evidence of improving skills and confidence in blended learning. 
Over 80% of survey respondents felt that the course would improve their career prospects. 
The interviews with course participants and impact case studies show that BLE helps participants meet their CPD goals. They also demonstrate the positive impact of imparting knowledge acquired on BLE to others within participants' organisations. 
The interviews also demonstrate the potential for BLE to help teacher trainees improve their practice and meet their professional development goals in blended learning.
