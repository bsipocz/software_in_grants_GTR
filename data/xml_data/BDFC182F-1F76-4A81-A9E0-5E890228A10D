Moreover, surveys suggest that if money was not an issue far more women would undergo such procedures, which are seen as increasingly 'normal', 'routine' and part of the 'beauty regimes' of 'ordinary women'. This project will consider the beauty norms which underlie this trend from cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral perspectives. The assumption of the network is that beauty image is becoming ever more demanding and defining of women, and increasingly men, irrespective of their professions. The project will ask whether this is the case, and how this norm is constituted and how it impacts upon women. It will also ask whether the dominant beauty norm is increasingly a global beauty norm, and thus open to less cultural and sub-cultural resistance. The project is especially concerned with role of technology in this. In particular, that procedures which were once regarded as 'exceptional' such as the use of surgery, are now regarded as 'normal' or even 'required' in certain contexts. Other increasingly demanding beauty requirements include hair removal and 'non-invasive' procedures to reduce the appearance of wrinkles. All of these procedures, whether 'routine' or 'exceptional', require time and effort to maintain, and arguably the 'minimum' required is increasing; fewer women go 'bare faced' or bare their flesh without hair removal. This project will explore the extent to which beauty norms are changing and how as well as what this means for individuals, for regulation and for clinical practice. It will explore the 'perfectionist trend' that extends the use of medical and scientific procedures to 'cosmetic procedures'. In light of this it will explore how the use and development of such procedures in the service of such norms changes the concepts of 'health', 'normality' and 'perfection' and in turn how these feed into self-understandings and identity, social expectations, medical practice and regulation.
The project is timely as it connects 'moral panics' about the sexualisation of culture (which is often connected to claims about appearance and clothing) to worries about the number of cosmetic procedures performed on young girls (often to be 'normal') and the rise of eating disorders. All of these signify the increasing importance of appearance, the narrowing of what is considered 'normal', the increasing pressure to comply to such norms and the increasing reliance on, and expectation of, technology (whether surgical or non-invasive procedures) to provide a means to achieve these ideals. This project looks at the changing ideals, how technology is used, and at the practices, policies and regulation of these practices. It asks whether such changes are fundamental (either to understandings of beauty or to understandings of such practices as 'medical') and whether current practices, such as consent or balancing risk, are appropriate to regulate such practices, or whether the changes are social and as such require different frameworks to address them. While there has been significant work on this in popular literature there has been much less genuinely multidisciplinary engagement connecting the underlying concepts and assumptions to the duties of the medical profession, and to regulation and legislation. This network will address this gap in collaboration and partnership with policy makers, particularly with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCoB). The PI and the NCoB will collaborate on gaining policy buy-in to the work which is of such import to the pubic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network's particular strength lies in bringing previously separate disciplinary work into close collaboration with key stakeholders interested in the areas of changing attitudes to body image and beauty norms and the consequent changes to uses of beauty procedures. Particular concerns of the network are portrayal of beauty in popular culture and the inadequacy of existing regulations governing beauty procedures. The existing partnership with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NoCB) will be strengthened through the network activities, to which the NoCB has signed up to as an official partner. The NoCB will thus act as an enabler and conduit between the academics and relevant stakeholders. 

Who will benefit?

Immediate beneficiaries are thus NoCB as the main partner and a broad range of practising clinicians and policy makers from professional medical organisations, regulatory bodies and government departments both in the UK and EU with which the network will directly engage. Indirect and long-term beneficiaries will be the public in general, particularly women and young girls whose daily lives are influenced by changing and dominating ideas of beauty and who are striving to meet these ideals by using a range of different mediums, from normal beauty procedures to medicalised interventions, putting themselves at risk often unknowingly. These beneficiaries will be reached via the social media activities of the network. In addition, the network activities as such include cultural participants, such as artists and journalists alongside medical practitioners and policy makers.

How will they benefit?

The network will have likely impacts on policy debate and making as well as public discourse. There is growing concern from relevant institutions and public bodies on the lack of regulation of beauty procedures, such as The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence concern about Botox treatments, and these stakeholders will be better informed about the key issues that need to be addressed as the network will explore these for the first time in a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral approach. The public will be better informed about the underlying risks that come with beauty procedures leading to an enhanced understanding of the major issues that need to be addressed in the area of changing ideas of beauty, from moral and ethical as well as legal perspectives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26108</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nuffield Council on Bioethics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Nuffield Council on Bioethics to enhance Policy Impact</gtr:description><gtr:id>7EB26DBF-1C57-4C1D-A91C-D0C120C9E4EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Beauty Demands: Briefing Paper' multidisciplinary (primarily drawing on psychology, philosophy and law) but with policy recommendations aimed at a wider audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8090017bff2.20609416-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Nuffield Council on Bioethics contributed by hosting 1 workshop, by funding travel of their staff to 3 workshops and covering their staff time. They also hosted the final event of the Network, (a final conference and a policy event) and covering their staff time, to a tune of approximately &amp;pound;1355. The most important contribution was the hosting of the launch of the briefing paper, as it is likely that policy makers attended the Nuffield event who may not have attended a University event. In particular, medics attended including, policy-makers from the GMC, members of medical professional bodies, including muscular dystrophy UK and Medical Women's Federation. In addition, we have members of the fashion industry and a number of journalists who work for the national press.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Growing relationship in terms of working together to define key speakers and topics to ensure that the breifing paper and policy outcomes are strong. The briefing paper was drafted by the PI and the Deputy Director of the Nuffield Council with input from project team and network members. The work of the Beauty Demands network has dovetailed highly effectively with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics' project exploring the ethical issues arising out of the growing use of cosmetic procedures (http://nuffieldbioethics.org/project/cosmetic-procedures/).
The four Beauty Demands workshops (which, as a network partner, Council staff were able to attend,) provided a valuable conduit to academics and practitioners working in this field. In doing so, the network provided both a helpful short-cut to important areas of debate and literature, and also facilitated contact with key individuals working in the field, who have subsequently engaged in the Council project either as Working Party members, or through providing direct evidence and input through the Working Party's consultative activities. The wider scope of the network ('beauty' in a very broad sense, not limited to the 'cosmetic procedures' in the Council's terms of reference) has been a particular bonus, with workshop debate on the distinctions between 'routine' and 'exceptional' treatments contributing to the Working Party's thinking with respect to the robustness of commonly-used definitions and distinctions. Many speakers from workshops are now a members of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on Cosmetic Procedures (see key findings).

To date, there have been nearly 100 original contributions to the blog (this figure does not include general news or posts intended to promote events). Posts are by established academics, ECRs and PhD students, as well as by non-academics (practitioners and journalists). Blogs have been authored by members of the project team and the wider network, and one off posts have been received from non-members. 

Since its launch, the blog has been viewed over 17,000 times by readers in over 20 countries across the world (including the USA, Canada, Brazil, India, Romania, Indonesia, Singapore and South Africa). The majority of our blog output is linked to the topics covered by the workshops and all workshop participants are required to write an extended abstract (adapted for a general readership) to contribute to the blog. ECRs and PhD Students have also written reflection posts about the workshop they attended. The blog is and on-going deliverable of the Network and both the Network and blog will extend beyond the life of the project. The blog is disseminated via Twitter, where we have 400 unique followers and our Twitter 'impressions' (the number of times each Tweet is seen) average 10,000 per month.

Members come from a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, law, sociology and psychology as well as those who work in the beauty industry, cosmetic surgeons and the Chief Executive of the appearance charity, Changing Faces. The majority of Network members are UK based, but we are increasingly being approached by members from elsewhere in the world.

The main deliveravles of the Network were four workshops held in Warwick University, Birmingham University, Nuffield Council on Bioethics and MMU. These workshops brought together multi-disciplinary academics (from anthropology, art history, cultural studies, gender studies, law, philosophy, psychology, race and ethnicity studies, sociology) with practitioners (surgeons, medics, nurses, psychologists, councillors) and artists, curators and journalists. This has led to cross-discipline insights published in the policy-focused 'Beauty Demands: Briefing Paper' and academic publications. The primary academic publication is a Special Issue of Health Care Analysis which will be published in 2017 (2 papers are already published in on-line first) and all are submitted. The briefing paper and its launch has been particularly successful in engaging a non-academic audience in the work of the Network. 

The Network and Beauty Demands blog are on-going.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The insights will be taken forward academically (in ongoing publications and likely future collaborations).
