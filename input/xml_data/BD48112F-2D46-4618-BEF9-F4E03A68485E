Refugees are selected for resettlement by potential host states, in their country of first asylum. In the UK, refugees are selected for resettlement specifically on the basis of their vulnerability, making adaptation even more challenging.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research explores the experiences of resettled refugees who arrived in the UK more than five years ago. These focus on those who already have substantial experience of living in the UK differs from previous research in this area and allows the research to explore longer term integration for those who have experienced the dramatic changes associated with resettlement. The research interprets integration very broadly as a wide range of processes that help to facilitate life in a new place.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through a longitudinal questionnaire, interviews and focus groups with resettled refugees the research will contribute to information on how the integration efforts of vulnerable people arriving in the UK can be supported. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, there are four key stakeholders in this project: 
UK central government (e.g., Home Office, Department for Communities and Local Government, Department for Work and Pensions).
Local government (e.g., Brighton &amp;amp; Hove, Manchester, Norwich)
Refugee support NGOs (e.g., Refugee Action, Refugee Council)
Refugees themselves
Representatives of all four stakeholder groups will be involved in the research throughout thus ensuring the maximum interchange of ideas and information. 
Stakeholders will benefit from the research in the following ways:
UK central government: by having access to a detailed longitudinal evaluation of how the Gateway Protection Programme (GPP) is working in three geographical areas with varying types and amounts of local governmental and NGO support. Evidence on the effectiveness of the GPP is very scarce and is concentrated in the first year after arrival. It has not hitherto considered the full range of adaptation outcomes including well-being, self-efficacy and perceived social acceptance nor in a longitudinal context. Ultimately, it is to be hoped that this will lead to an improvement in the quality of the GPP. 
Local government: by being provided with both evidence on the success of refugee integration in their particular areas as well as comparative data from two other local authorities. In this way, lessons of good (and bad) practice in the resettlement of refugees can be shared and the quality of local services for refugees will be enhanced. It is hoped that more detailed information on pathways to successful integration for resettled refugees will encourage more local councils to become involved in the GPP and thereby increase the total UK capacity for resettlement. 
Refugee support NGOs: by being provided with evidence on the effectiveness of their support services for refugees in three different geographical areas. It is anticipated that this may lead to the improvements of those services and also a better integration of the work of NGOs and local authorities.
Refugees themselves: the wider community of refugees in the UK will benefit in the long-term by the improvement in the support they are provided with by national and local government and NGOs. This should benefit their quality of life. A small group of refugees who will be recruited to work on the project will benefit by acquiring new skills, hence hopefully enhancing their future employment prospects. 
Overall, it is hoped that this project will ultimately lead to more successful integration of refugees into mainstream British economic and cultural activities. It will have direct impacts on the management of the GPP at a local level, through the provision of detailed information on ways of supporting and enhancing the connections refugees form to others in society. In so doing, it should also improve the quality of intergroup relationships between the host majority and the refugee community, with consequent benefits for societal cohesion and harmony. New evidence collected by the project and dissemination strategies may also have an impact on national level policy decisions around possible expansion of the GPP.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349005</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SHARE network</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>SHARE partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>08862F1A-AE58-4E38-ADCA-F10A63526392</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546be1de007930.00929579-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners have increased the visibility of this research project, publicising the research across their EU network</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The main postdoctoral fellow manning the project was invited as an expert training consultant to the SHARE refugee resettlement network.

When analysing differences in well-being between locations, no significant differences were found. That is, well-being was the same in all locations. There were however differences in the number of people employed. The highest percentage of employed people among our respondents was in Norwich, while the lowest was in Greater Manchester. Yet, in all locations, less than 41% of respondents was employed - this includes part time and temporary employment. These percentages are much lower than the general employment rates in these locations.
For those who were looking for work, but had not found any work yet, we asked what they considered their main difficulties were in finding work. Language barriers were mentioned most often of all, closely followed by qualifications not being recognised in the UK. Both issues were also highlighted in many of the interviews, and were also the indicated as the reason why those respondents who did have a job, had one at a much lower level than their potential. Language barriers were often seen as a more general barrier against participation in society as a whole. 

The second aim of the project is to find the key determinants of well-being among resettled refugees. We have now completed surveys and interviews for all three time points. There were many significant correlations with well-being. For example, strongly positively related to well-being were: social capital, self-efficacy, intergroup confidence, cultural understanding, quantity of contact with people of the same cultural background and with British people, and satisfaction with one's job, house, and education. Strong negative correlates were: perceived discrimination, intergroup anxiety, and negative contact experiences with British people, with people of the same cultural background, and with people back home, and finally, a longer duration of a search for a place in education.Based on these correlates, several interesting statistical models have been developed. Those are not all reviewed here, but to summarise: contact with different cultural groups plays an important role in explaining well-being. One example: respondents who have a lot of contact with both British people and people of the same cultural background as themselves have the highest well-being scores. The longitudinal design of our survey allows us to demonstrate not only that these relationships are consistent across each time point, but that certain features are closely related with changes at subsequent time points. The most significant finding here, one picked up on in the Guardian article on the project, is that English language ability relates closely to both employment and the extent of contact with native English speakers (the majority population) at later time points, but not the other way round. This means that someone who speaks better English is more likely to find a job and to experience positive contact with the majority population, but someone who already has a job will not necessarily improve their English through work. The relationship between language and other social indicators was well established but our research has provided new evidence for the direction of causality of these links, highlighting the importance of good English language education for resettled refugees.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings are already feeding into the ways in which resettled refugees are provided with cultural orientation. The ongoing work with the Home Office integration team highlights important future directions.
