This has been catalysed by economic crisis, (new) media, global flows, and processes of fragmentation of the State and exacerbated in the UK by fractures in the union and the questioning of our role in Europe. As a result, although all communities reproduce divisions and exclusions, certain communities have been disenfranchised in particular ways and have been intensely demonised, objectified and culturally pathologised. 

The current uncertainties around immigration, cultural difference, rights and responsibilities are deeply entwined with our research themes of colonialism, race and resistance and our aim to explore the creativity that these circumstances produce. Against current theoretical and conceptual approaches, and by co-producing knowledge with communities, Creative Interruptions will interrogate disconnection as a site of productive resistance and, through a range of creative methods, connect the disconnections found in different communities. It aims to reveal different senses of community by asking what happens when we look at disconnection through the lens of creativity. 

Disconnection, and its resultant disenfranchisement, are processes driven by the practice of power relations, through the enactment of law, public policy, and social practices that create obstacles for some communities to participate fully and have their voices heard. This study will examine the cultural politics at work that deliberately invoke and engage with different, marginalised individuals, organisations and networks in society: the low-paid &amp;quot;migrant worker&amp;quot;, the racialised black subject, the historically oppressed Northern Irish, the Palestinian filmmaker or post-partition Punjabi citizen. Through five, internationally-linked strands of work (across the UK, Northern Ireland, Palestine, India), this study will consolidate different types of knowledge (academic, community and creative). 

Creative Interruptions will contribute to the AHRC's Connected Communities research cluster on 'diversity and dissent' by recognising the key role of the creative industries (including the arts, heritage, media and other forms of cultural production) as major agents for social change, but also by highlighting the role of communities to interrupt dominant discourses and representations in ways not available in authorised cultural discourse. Our central hypothesis is that cultural diversity brings important rewards for individuals, communities and societies. It will explore the relationship between the margins as a site of possibility, pluralities and playfulness but also of disconnection and dispossession. The project will research the local and global dynamics that rupture, alienate and marginalise, foregrounding the creative tools used by communities to cope with such processes of disconnection, division and exclusion.

Disconnection is, therefore, considered as 'a space for radical openness' that is embraced by groups at times to challenge oppressive, imperialist and neo-liberal power structures. Disconnected communities are positioned as having dynamic, fluid identities, and instead of aiming to connect such groups to the centre, to help them to learn how to submit to more normalised modes of communication and cultural production, the research asks what can be learned by the centre from the margins, and how can such lessons be understood, communicated and scaled-up in order to change the centre and connect those on the margins to each other.

Creative Interruptions offers a field-defining, self-reflexive, international research project that works across a range of historical and cultural diversity contexts with multiple communities in order to connect the disconnections and combine disciplinary and public knowledge through community-based participatory research and creative practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?
1) Publics and Communities, particularly those who have been socially excluded, disenfranchised or marginalised
2) Creative and Cultural Practitioners
3) Media
4) Non HES: Statutory, non-governmental and activist organisations working in the field of social justice, equality and diversity
5) Policy makers and bodies 
6) Academic researchers in media studies, postcolonial studies, human geography, literary studies, visual cultures, drama and film studies, cultural sociology, social work, conflict resolution and cultural policy, in the UK, Northern Ireland, Palestine, India and internationally
7) Researchers involved in the project, notably the local Community researchers, Digital Researcher, PhD Students and Knowledge Transfer Researchers

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT?
The project will improve understanding of:
- Disconnection, disenfranchisement and its effects
- The value of arts, media and creativity in addressing the challenges associated with 'disconnection'
- Effective qualitative methods for researching marginalised communities, reflective learning and new and innovative ways of working with disenfranchised communities
- The creative work, tools used and acts led by marginalised communities in historical and contemporary, national and international contexts
- The consequences of marginalised groups' creative acts for the arts and cultural sectors and for communities themselves
- Ways in which the arts and cultural sector might work with marginalised communities and create spaces for 'unauthorised' voices to be heard
- Ways to reduce social divisions and processes of exclusion
- Creative, ethical approaches for engaging with diverse communities in multiple, international contexts and of the potential impact on the way that people interact and connect within and across their various communities
- Research capacity building

WHAT WILL BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT?
-Our local research partners (e.g. Qattan Foundation and CRCI Punjab), are involved directly in developing cultural interventions and have close links with related ministries and the broader policy community.
-The International Advisory Group will meet annually and will include subject experts and community representatives. The IAG will be consulted regularly and kept informed.
-Community Stakeholder Activities will be held at the outset and during the lifetime of the project through a programme of workshops and consultations, and during the launch, dissemination and end of project stages.
- The PI and CoIs have strong experience of working with community groups in previous (including Connected Communities) projects and during the funded, collaborative RD phase.
- Co-production will enable awareness of the research, secure on-going commitment to it, and ensure it is locally relevant and has potential co-value embedded in the process. The resulting co-produced knowledge should be both relevant and acceptable to research users in the UK, Palestine, India, and beyond.
-The research, emerging findings and media communications will be produced in formats tailored to diverse, international audiences. The website will facilitate a long-term record of achievements, detailing and showcasing outputs, community engagement processes and debates. 
- The Institute for Public Policy Research will work with us on crafting policy briefings designed for impact and on our media dissemination strategy.
-Findings will be disseminated to academics from diverse disciplines through conference presentations, articles in international peer reviewed journals and discoverable research mechanisms. 
-The impact strategy will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. Community co-production activities will be monitored and feedback sought to inform regular review and updating of our strategy. A year after the end of the project, the strategy will be evaluated through an open-ended stakeholder questionnaire.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1214115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N004094/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
