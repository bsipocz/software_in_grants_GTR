Metabolism and growth at night are fueled by carbohydrates released by degradation of starch, made during photosynthesis in the preceding day. Starch synthesis and degradation are regulated such that starch reserves are almost but not quite exhausted at the end of the night, in both long and short nights. We have recently found that this regulation is a function of the circadian clock, an endogenous timer that allows plants to anticipate and prepare for daily changes in their environment. The clock controls the rate of starch degradation at night, so that reserves last until the anticipated dawn. Starvation and growth arrest are avoided. This important discovery opens the way to new levels of understanding of the control of plant growth and productivity. TiMet, an EU-funded consortium of researchers in Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the UK, uses experimental and theoretical plant Systems Biology to understand the regulatory interactions between the clock gene circuit and metabolism, and their emergent effects on growth and productivity. Jointly-conducted experiments will use responses to day-length and light-quality regimes that perturb clock function, and a large set of mutants deficient in clock or central metabolic functions. High throughput technologies will enable study of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational events, providing a depth of analysis hitherto unattained for either the clock or metabolism in plants. Innovative data mining and modelling platforms will underpin new, mechanistic models of each subsystem, integrate them for the first time, and test the emergent effects on plant growth rate and productivity. At JIC, we will focus specifically on the control by the circadian clock of partitioning of photoassimilate between starch and sucrose during the day.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202617</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Plant photosynthesis provides all of our food, and a significant proportion of our fuel and industrial raw materials. Demand for the products of photosynthesis will increase dramatically in the next few decades in response to an increasing population and the linked problems of decreasing fossil fuel availability and rapid, detrimental climate change. 
The Earth's rotation predictably removes sunlight - and hence the opportunity for photosynthesis - for a significant part of each day, and each plant's lifespan. Plants must orchestrate the accumulation and use of sugars from photosynthesis over the daily cycle to avoid periods of starvation, and thus optimise growth rates. In the light, many plants make both sugar for immediate growth and starch, which is stored and then used to make sugars during the succeeding night. Prior to this project we knew that plants possess a circadian clock that can potentially provide predictive regulation of plant processes over the day/night cycle. We had also recently discovered that the circadian clock controls the rate of starch conversion to sugars at night, so that this store lasts for the entire night, irrespective of the length of the night. The aim of this project was to establish the extent of interactions between the clock and plant sugar and starch metabolism, and the importance of these interactions for whole-plant growth and productivity. The project involved about seven laboratories in four European countries and included expertise in systems biology, various aspects of plant metabolism, modelling approaches, and the circadian clock. 
Working with modellers, we developed and tested a model to explain how the circadian clock may influence the rate of starch degradation. This model provides new ideas for experimental exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms. 
Using insights from our model, we investigated how information from the circadian clock may alter the rate of starch degradation. Our results showed that this process probably involves modulation of the activity of enzymes called glucan, water dikinases that modify the properties of the surface of starch granules and thus influence the rate at which the granules can be broken down.
We discovered mechanisms that determine the relative amounts of starch and sugar made from photosynthesis during the day. In short days, the ratio of starch to sugar is high, thus a large proportion of the products of photosynthesis is stored to provide a sugar supply during the long night. In long days, relatively little starch is synthesised. We showed that this adjustment of starch and sugars synthesis is brought about by changes in the activity of an important enzyme of starch synthesis called ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, or AGPase. Plants containing a modified form of AGPase, lacking regulatory properties, were unable to adjust the ratio of starch to sugar according to day length.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Plant growth rates and productivity are major traits for all plant breeding. Their importance is becoming even more evident in light of present global food shortages, continuing population growth, increasing use of arable land for energy crops and urbanisation, and the need to produce fuel and raw materials as well as food from crop plants. It will be particularly important to breed crop plants with robust productivity in the face of rapid environmental change. The orchestration of metabolism and growth in response to environmental signals via the clock is a basic feature of plant biology, with a major effect on overall productivity. Our project aims to decipher the regulatory networks that link the clock, carbon flows and growth in the nodel species Arabidopsis. However, the specific knowledge and concepts, the analytic approaches, the data handling and in particular the models will be strongly applicable to crop plant improvement.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A929CB39-C1E2-4A0F-9872-67464804FE45</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460f7573eb525.44521306</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0DEB00FD-ED07-4919-99BB-39D9A74A4342</gtr:id><gtr:title>Starch and the clock: the dark side of plant productivity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9f3ab46279de209efddc3fb2a1d460d5"><gtr:id>9f3ab46279de209efddc3fb2a1d460d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Graf A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1360-1385</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5440fa9d6d2707.91414486</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C239DC0C-49B4-4FC9-97D4-A064CC94C3EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulatory properties of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase are required for adjustment of leaf starch synthesis in different photoperiods.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f3d3b16f47a71edfa12a0f3143d129e"><gtr:id>7f3d3b16f47a71edfa12a0f3143d129e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mugford ST</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56ba03ccae94e7.65025235</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F58FAED6-7864-4462-B3D3-39C30762AD55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arabidopsis plants perform arithmetic division to prevent starvation at night.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>eLife</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/978cb97711ed65ed85088ab4cf17356c"><gtr:id>978cb97711ed65ed85088ab4cf17356c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scialdone A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2050-084X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544675c7d3f8b7.84827313</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BA47FEC1-7BAB-4B48-8E10-9DCFF405D0C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leaf Starch Turnover Occurs in Long Days and in Falling Light at the End of the Day.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ff9fff6b5097112525f6fe130bb0164"><gtr:id>2ff9fff6b5097112525f6fe130bb0164</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fernandez O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9fe0bcd4ad26.49076924</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DF5B8927-A509-40A8-87A4-F0BF16BED428</gtr:id><gtr:title>Glucan, Water Dikinase Exerts Little Control over Starch Degradation in Arabidopsis Leaves at Night.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b3a9d682d09b0cd4a9efaaab952f2591"><gtr:id>b3a9d682d09b0cd4a9efaaab952f2591</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Skeffington AW</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>543b9b4d520436.23193817</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCDC2D86-E9D4-4296-A4BB-144A3212EF0A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Starch in the Arabidopsis plant</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Starch - St?rke</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b57ccfaab2cedb549155707885444d88"><gtr:id>b57ccfaab2cedb549155707885444d88</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfcafca83a0476</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA418</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
