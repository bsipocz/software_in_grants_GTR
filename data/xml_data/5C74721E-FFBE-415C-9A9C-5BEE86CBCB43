Although vacuum and mask-based lithography techniques are already employed in industry for nano-scale manufacturing of semi-conductor devices and the derived nano electro mechanical systems (NEMS) components, they still have a number of limitations associated with them. In particular, these fabrication technologies rely on capital-intensive equipment while being restricted to the fabrication of planar features and constrained to a limited set of processed materials. Besides, there are also increased concerns over their environmental friendliness as they are energy and resource intensive and generate significant waste. 

In this context, this proposal will focus on the development of high-speed AFM probe-based mechanical machining at nano scale. The process represents an alternative and innovative solution that can potentially address the lack of cost effective, 3 dimensional and more environmentally friendly fabrication technologies for producing nano-structured components in a wide range of materials. However, to fully realise the potential of AFM probe-based machining, a step-change in its throughput is still required. For this reason, the research put forward in this project aims to develop a new actuation device that could be readily fitted on commercial AFM instruments to reach untapped processing speeds when conducting tip-based machining operations. 

This new actuation device, which will rely on piezo-electric actuators, will be fixed onto the stage of AFMs and will be used to create fast rotating displacements of a processed sample with respect to the tip of an AFM probe. The vision is to enhance the capability of current AFM systems by enabling them to perform nano-scale material removal operations at cutting speeds a thousand times faster compared to state of the art in this field. In particular, the developed set-up will be designed so that it enables cutting speeds from a few m/min up to a few hundreds of m/min to be reached. 

Two major advantages are envisaged with the development of this new set-up. First, it will provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to vacuum and mask-based lithography techniques for nano-scale fabrication. Second, due to the fact that AFMs are widespread in research laboratories, it will contribute to broaden the base of users with in-house manufacturing capabilities for the nano-machining of components with sub-micrometre structures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project outcome could result in addressing a number of issues, which cannot be tackled simultaneously by the current vacuum and mask-based nano-manufacturing processes. In particular, the production of three dimensional nano-structures in a cost-effective manner and in a broad range of material continues to remain a major challenge despite the fact that such nano-structured components can readily find applications in emerging fields such as photonics, biosensors, fuel cells and data storage. Thus, from an economic point of view, the project will contribute to the creation of more accessible and more environmentally friendly capabilities for the production of nanotechnology-based devices. In turn, this should open the door to an increased number of small and medium size enterprises and more modest research labs to consider and benefit from nanotechnology-enabled solutions.

In the long-term, the wider society will also benefit from the proposed research programme. This should be achieved by enabling the development of novel nanotechnology-based products with potential applications for improving public health, well-being and security.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314172</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E53FDEE4-0D4C-4F23-851D-9D37D09F3627</gtr:id><gtr:title>Insight into mechanics of AFM tip-based nanomachining: bending of cantilevers and machined grooves.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nanotechnology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cd9d376760e2d9fdf6dd75ad5ea6e67e"><gtr:id>cd9d376760e2d9fdf6dd75ad5ea6e67e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Al-Musawi RS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0957-4484</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d35083f6e02.86290772</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>16424704-5AB5-4A68-B9E3-67A1755B736D</gtr:id><gtr:title>AFM tip-based nanomachining with increased cutting speed at the tool-workpiece interface</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Precision Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f588d6a5fc772fb2f17e3afae611fe1d"><gtr:id>f588d6a5fc772fb2f17e3afae611fe1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Geng Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>01416359</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8019cb30c42.12974067</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M020703/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
