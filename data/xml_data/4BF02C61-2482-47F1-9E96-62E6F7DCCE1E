The project is divided into two main stages. The first will develop new 'Perspectives' on the current portfolio based on existing 'Grants on the Web' data, the second will use spinout workshops to kick-start the use of the Perspectives and provide feedback on best practice from cross-ICT meetings.
In the first phase we will use text mining and simple visualisation techniques to provide 'at a glance' overviews of the portfolio in the form of word-clouds or similar intuitive presentations. All terminology will be derived from the community, either from the grant summaries and titles or by canvassing the community directly. The 'at a glance' views will also provide the top level of an intuitive navigation system which will allow users to rapidly drilldown to project and investigator descriptions using the natural structure inherent in 'Grants on the Web' and derived using text mining.

As well as being viewable on the web these Perspectives will also be available as a set of standalone materials and associated tools for ICT strategy and Network workshops. They will provide an accessible overview of the portfolio and its natural structure. The latter will be presented in interactive dendrogram form to allow easy partitioning for scoping more detailed workshop breakout sessions.

The second phase of the project will focus on networking. Six 'spinout' workshops will be organised by open call that will make use of Perspectives' materials and tools to facilitate brainstorming and road-mapping type activities. Meetings that bring together two or more Networks will be especially sought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe that the most important impact will be on future ICT research as the project aim is to transform the way in which researchers, and other stakeholders, contribute to the formulation of strategy. The project will provide the type of structured overview, expressed in the community's own terms and derived from the community's own data, that will enable participants to contribute efficiently, collegiately and meaningfully to such processes.

Furthermore, we believe that the creation of snapshot Perspectives for other EPSRC, Research Council, and possibly EU Framework sectors, has significant potential both to promote ICT and allow the project to be of significant use to a much wider audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186601</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NEMODE Community Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>582F853B-3261-4B22-AC24-D3BA8BCC7D5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Before the meeting, all attending delegates were invited to take part in a remote, online study where they arranged the themes submitted by their peers into groups.

The awareness of the Networks of each other and of themselves to the outside world and EPSRC was increased, thanks to the attendance of approximately 20 of the Network leads. Plans for future Network of Network meetings were also decided.

a. the research coverage of the networks;
b. their research challenges and relationships;
c. potential inter-network collaborations; and
d. their coverage of the ICT research landscape.

The main impact from this meeting was the creation of an EPSRC Network of Networks Meeting Report which shed light on the coverage of the EPSRC networks in relation to their research and where possible overlaps might be.
The major items of the document are:
a. a structured challenge map;
b. an ICT topic map showing each network's research coverage;
c. a summarising chord diagram and individual network proformas that identify potential collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54579abdafffe7.26564313</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.well-sorted.org/explore/NetworkOfNetworks2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ICT Early Career Researcher Workshop, Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31BF19C8-4A00-4DE8-8219-C0F24E625546</gtr:id><gtr:impact>60 early career academics attended a talk about how to present their research to those outside their immediate sphere and then performed networking events structured using our tools which helped them learn how best to explain/word their research to their peers.

Attendees got a chance to network with a wide variety of their peers and some reported a much improved knowledge of how to word and communicate their research to those not directly involved in their research area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457956ee61684.75313921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.researchperspectives.org/meetings/ICTEarlyCareerGlasgow2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Further Well Sorted meetings (now over 100 meetings and approaching 10,000 ideas)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E01D5FD8-FF94-41F2-9640-480174639AA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further Well Sorted meetings organised (@UK and Chinese universities, UK Research Councils and InnovateUK) see https://www.well-sorted.org/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9138c376712.07107208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.well-sorted.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The tools have been used by EPSRC, AHRC, MRC, ESRC, RCUK DE, BT, UKHDAN, and Innovate UK and many networks of academics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D6B956A1-EB4E-480F-98A9-1BFC2FC7296D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5450bc579d90f1.60708871</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project is developing novel data mining and meeting tools to help Research Council staff and researchers collaborate across councils and projects. The data mining is used to discover the latent structure of, connections between, research projects of projects funded by NSF and UK's Research Councils (EPSRC, ESRC, BBSRC, NERC, AHRC, MRC, and STFC).
Both of the major outputs are already having major impact. 
ReseachPerspectives.org provides topic modelling, data mining and visualisation of 180,000 UK &amp;amp; US grants. This software is now being ported to EPSRC internal project and is viewed daily by many research organisations.
Well-sorted.org is a pre-meeting tool that helps experts suggest and remotely structure research ideas BEFORE the meeting. Since release in Jan 2014 it has been used twenty major meetings of 20-80 stakeholders and has had over 6000 items and over 1500 sorts submitted. Users include EPSRC, AHRC, MRC, ESRC, RCUK DE, BT, UKHDAN, and Innovate UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Both ReseachPerspectives.org and Well-sorted.org are in constant use for a wide range of activities. The main mechanism for dissemination is attendance and/or use at Research Council network and strategy development meetings. In the last couple of months this increase has been exponential in nature, requiring us to automate some of the manual procedures.

These approaches solve generic problems and are applicable to almost all sectors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7B765DE6-7048-4C3C-B7D4-81EF6ACB3BD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2004707559.94758327774441c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://researchperspectives.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Topic modelling, data mining and visualisation of 180,000 RCUK and NSF grants.</gtr:description><gtr:id>069DBA72-05A4-4348-ACF4-ED283213BB96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In use by many Resreach Councils and research organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5450d17abe4b70.66784888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Research Perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.researchperspectives.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Online Card Sorting - specifically designed for support of strategy generation and other large meetings of experts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>429ADA01-1C65-4439-B616-CE4A87F52A66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In use by MRC, AHRC, EPSRC, ESRC, BT, InnovateUK</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5450d0bb9efd11.77251624</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Well-sorted.org pre-meeting brain-storming and meeting organisation tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.well-sorted.org/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FBA4D580-4A10-40BC-BEF9-8142C54F9557</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is British HCI Important?
