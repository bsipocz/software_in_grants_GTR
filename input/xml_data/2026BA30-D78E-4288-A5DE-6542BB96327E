Even our own species has been suggested to result from hybridization with chimpanzee lineages a few million years ago, although this conclusion is contested. Recent high-throughput genomics technologies now permit detailed investigation of complex speciation in likely non-model organism candidates, such as Heliconius butterflies. Heliconius are conspicuous warningly coloured tropical butterflies distasteful to birds. The patterns of most species also mimic those of other Heliconius or ithomiine butterflies. Some species show remarkable divergence in colour patterns between geographical races or species, but others share suspiciously similar patterns with closely related species, which they could have acquired via hybridization long after speciation. Hybridization is common: 35% of species are involved. In the melpomene/silvaniform group, almost all species are known to hybridize and backcross in both lab and in nature. This fascinating system provides an excellent test group for studying recent ideas about complex speciation. In this project, we will determine the extent to which four species (Heliconius melpomene, H. numata, H. elevatus and H. timareta) have recently exchanged parts of their genomes. This project brings together British and overseas knowledge of Heliconius butterfly biology and the latest genomic technologies to understand the genetic mechanisms that lead to the origin and maintenance of species. We propose to combine new high-throughput genomic technologies (454 and Solexa sequencing, and Illumina genotyping array chips) to map genomic regions in two focal species, H. melpomene and H. numata from Peru. Next generation sequencing technology will be used to obtain large amounts of genomic sequence data from the two species to identify thousands of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Subsequently, we will use these SNPs to produce high resolution genetic maps of each species. We will then genotype wild-caught specimens of H. melpomene, H. numata, H. elevatus and H. timareta. If complex speciation is occurring, we expect to find regions of shared polymorphism (indicating regions of recent exchange) and 'genomic islands' of fixed differences (indicating regions of older divergence probably surrounding sites of divergently selected genes such as those affecting mimicry, genomic incompatibility, mate choice, and ecological adaptations). A number of Eastern Andean taxa have recently been discovered that are close to H. melpomene, yet remain distinct from that species. The species contain some gene markers more similar to another species, H. cydno, but unlike that species they often share the local mimicry colour pattern of H. melpomene. We predict that these forms acquired their colour pattern via hybridization, which is a relatively common phenomenon in Heliconius. Using SNPs concentrated around these genes we will investigate the possibility that H. melpomene genes have been transferred to these segregate forms via hybridization, leading to the formation of new hybrid species. These SNPs will also allow investigation of colour pattern polymorphism in races of H. melpomene and H. numata The proposed research is a collaboration between Heliconius experts at a number of UK universities, The Gene Pool (Edinburgh), and the Centre for Microarray Resources (Cambridge). Further laboratory/bioinformatics support will be provided by the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology (Germany). Up to now, whole-genome studies have been restricted to a few model organisms such as fruit flies and mice. Our proposal outlines a means of enabling ground breaking whole-genome understanding of evolution and speciation in a wild tropical organism for the first time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recent studies suggest that speciation may be complex, such that different parts of the genome separate at different times, rather than in a simple, single-split process. Even our own species has been suggested to have acquired a chimpanzee X chromosome a few million years ago, although this conclusion is contentious. Few studies have investigated this possibility in any detail in likely candidate species. New genomics technologies now permit detailed investigations of complex speciation in non-model organisms such as the butterflies employed here. We will determine the extent to which four tropical American species (Heliconius melpomene, H. numata, H. elevatus and H. timareta) have recently exchanged parts of their genomes. We propose to combine high-throughput technologies (454/Solexa sequencing and Illumina SNP arrays) to produce high-resolution genomic maps of two main species, H. melpomene and H. numata from Peru; with existing BAC-end sequences these will act as scaffolds for ongoing genomics work by the Heliconius Consortium. We will genotype wild-caught specimens of the four species. If complex speciation is occurring, we expect to find regions of shared polymorphism (indicating regions of recent exchange) and 'genomic islands' of fixed differences (indicating regions of older divergence, in part protected by species isolating traits or regions of divergent selection). Higher resolution SNP maps near two colour pattern determining genes will also allow investigation of colour pattern polymorphism in races of H. melpomene and H. numata, as well as the possibility of transfer of colour pattern genes in East Andean species H. elevatus and H. timareta that share patterns with H. melpomene and are likely to have obtained them via hybridization.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>104485</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Blaxter lab collaborated closely wth artists-in-residence (see http://www.ascus.org.uk/ciie-micro-residency-artists-announced/) in the Centre for immunity Infection and Evolution to inspire and be part of the final exhibition &amp;quot;Transmissions&amp;quot;.

1. Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation

2-5. We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hoxgenes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organizationhas remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta andHeliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBB5A686-0CC7-4189-9DD5-CA59AB249533</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8410783846.313864779ebfb2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/><gtr:url>http://www.heliconius.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>ngenomes is a database for the display of genome assemblies from the Blaxter lab.

Genome sequencing, and large-scale, population genomic analysis, has suddenly become affordable. The explosion of data presents tremendous opportunity for ground-breaking research based on integration of data from independently-organized, community-driven genome projects, but this in turn requires shared database resources. For model organisms, genome databasing efforts grew with the research communities, and there are mature portals for deep investigation across many large scale datasets - the databases themselves have become a substrate for (meta-) research of high impact. For communities new to genomic (and population genomic) approaches, the need for accessible databases is even more pressing, as researchers are less likely to be fluent in the peculiar languages of genomics and in high-throughput bioinformatics. Here we propose the founding of a community database for lepidopteran genomics, LepBase, to meet the needs of the growing community of researchers using genomics to understand Lepidoptera as crop pests, as potentially invasive species, as developmental models, and as key taxa for understanding the interplay between ecology, genomics, evolution and speciation. While initially focussed on the available lepidopteran genomes the project will meet the challenge of future genomic riches (over 20 genomes 'in the pipeline') by building a platform that focuses on the needs of the lepidopteran research community.
The challenge of integrating newly developed genomic resources across taxa is not a new one, and several computational frameworks exist to support such endeavors (such as the ENSEMBL project, and the GMOD ecosystem of tools). Central, aggregative database efforts, such as ENSEMBL Genomes, provide an effective and powerful, one-size-fits-all solution to genome warehousing. Coordinating with smaller research communities to directly implement clade-specific resources is overwhelming the resources of institutions that have a mandate to generate integrated genomic databases. ENSEMBL now advocates a multi-tiered approach to the aggregation, integration, and dissemination of the rapidly increasing wealth of genomic information arising from community-driven genome projects so that species-level genomic resources can flow 'upstream' into the pan-genome database.
The goals of our project are: to develop a community-wide, comparative database for the Lepidoptera using the ENSEMBL platform; to institute effective tools for ongoing community annotation of emerging genomes; to forge close links with ENSEMBL Genomes to ensure upload of lepidopteran genomes into the global resource; to implement new modes of data visualisation and analysis in the ENSEMBL framework to meet community needs; and to provide training in genomics to the community of lepidopteran researchers. The LepBase database will also be a working model of community-driven databases that drive not only clade-specific research programmes but also enable the flow of knowledge from species-specific genome projects into a comprehensive framework.
The project will be based in the Blaxter bioinformatics and genomics group in Edinburgh, in association with the GenePool Genomics Facility (currently engaged in sequencing butterfly and moth species), with project partners in the Jiggins Heliconius research group in Cambridge and Dasmahapatra in York, and the support of lepidopteran researchers worldwide. Initial focus will be on the genus Heliconius, for which a complete genome sequence and abundant annotation, transcriptome and resequencing data already exist. The database will be rapidly extended into silkmoth, Bicyclus, Danaus and other species. The resource will be overseen by a Scientific Advisory Board drawn from across the range of lepidopteran researchers, and will aim for financial sustainability beyond the tenure of the award through development of a 'subscription' model of funding from research partners.</gtr:description><gtr:id>83BA150B-2F8D-47D7-A359-2A35F7DDBF80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460dea9a14e73.57588165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LepBase - lepidoptera genome database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://lepbase.org/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>These tools simplify the rool out of customised ENSEMBL databases.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D810E376-5819-437E-B938-984559D0BB32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have been inundated with requests for support and assistance in delivering these tools, and with praise for their ease of use and timeliness.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b09face038.57810165</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>EasyMirror/EasyImport</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.genomehubs.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9AD7BEB-F7B2-435E-A63F-58804D4FF7EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genome-wide patterns of divergence and gene flow across a butterfly radiation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular ecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a112e42007164eb4e8ba157e3f90c21b"><gtr:id>a112e42007164eb4e8ba157e3f90c21b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nadeau NJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0962-1083</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0650657289e95</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0BE2DD91-8070-4CEC-AC79-1F162424C78E</gtr:id><gtr:title>A conserved set of maternal genes?
