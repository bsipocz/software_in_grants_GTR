Do contemporary security practices provide 'gender security' in (post)conflict settings? How and why do the gendered subjects of (in)security demonstrate agency and resistance in response to peace and security interventions? 

UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) stresses the importance of integrating women and gender issues into matters of international peace and security. Yet many argue that international security interventions still fail to address the gender-specific concerns of women in conflict settings, and overlook the agency of women in war and peace. Disarmament, Demobilisation &amp;amp; Reintegration (DDR) programmes exemplify these issues. By eradicating weapons, disbanding armed groups and reintegrating ex-combatants, DDR seeks to secure durable peace. Mainstreaming gender concerns into DDR has potential to achieve positive change. Recognising women as agents not victims of war can help build a gender-just peace. Yet women are often excluded from or marginalised by DDR programs that neglect their interests, rights and needs.

To confront these challenges, the proposed project will develop an innovative approach to gender and security. The aims of this approach are to:

1. Develop a novel theoretical framework for understanding how gendered agency emerges and is deployed in relation to international security interventions;
2. Examine how women situated in (post)conflict settings demonstrate agency and resistance in response to security interventions;
3. Identify how 'gender' shapes international security discourses and practices;
4. Assess the extent to which 'gender security' is achieved in key sites of international intervention; and
5. Build a robust methodology and methods for mapping and analysing 'gender security' in (post)conflict environments.

To achieve these aims, the project will undertake a qualitative study of DDR policies and programmes in post-conflict BiH. The study will focus in particular on 'gender security' policies and practices relating to DDR via qualitative analysis of policy documents and interviews with implementers and beneficiaries. In particular, it will explore: the wartime roles of female (ex)combatants/women associated with fighting forces (WAFFs); their motivations for participating in the war effort; their positive and negative experiences of mobilisation; and long-term impact of participation in armed forces. The project will also analyse the gendered nature and impact of DDR policies and practices via an exploration of: women's participation and representation in the planning and design of DDR programmes; whether and how a gender perspective was incorporated into the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of DDR programming.

Overall, the study would make a major contribution to: current and future security policymaking and practice; understandings of the role of women as potential/actual agents of security; literatures on security studies, peace and conflict studies, and political sociology; methodologies within the disciplines of international relations and sociology that integrate feminist theory and empirical research and overcome divisions between scholars and practitioners; and finally, emerging debates in policymaking and academic circles regarding the importance of 'gender security'.

The project involves diverse forms of knowledge exchange with potential beneficiaries and users. Policymakers and practitioners from international organisations, security institutions and civil society will be engaged throughout the project via targeted briefings and consultation meetings, and policy report. The wider public will be engaged via a workshop and book launch in central London.

Ultimately, the study aims to transform understandings of 'gender security' by placing the concept of 'gendered agency' at the centre rather than margins of security discourse/practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project engages with a wide range of beneficiaries working on gender and security issues. 

The principal non-academic beneficiaries will be organisations working in humanitarian and security sectors, particularly those working in (post-)conflict settings, of which I have an extensive network of contacts to draw on to achieve non-academic impact. 

Key beneficiaries include: 

1. International and regional organisations

The UN Security Council has adopted a series of resolutions on Women, Peace and Security (WPS) which call for: the equal participation of women in decision-making, a gender perspective to be incorporated into peace operations, and the gendered impact of conflict to be addressed. International and regional organisations working in Bosnia (e.g. UN agencies, NATO, and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) are responding by undertaking similar commitments to advance the WPS agenda through their organisational structures, policies and programmes. The project will enable them to better assess the impact of these initiatives, and will provide suggestions for 'best practice' handling of gender security issues. This will improve the way organisations engage with women as security actors, leading to improved security outcomes. There is potential for global impact as Bosnia and Western Balkans region is often viewed as a testing ground for international intervention, with lessons learned there being drawn on to direct policymaking and programming in other post-conflict countries (e.g. Iraq and Afghanistan). 

2. Domestic security institutions (e.g. Ministries of Defence and Security, Gender Equality Agencies) 

Domestic institutions in BiH are working to increase the participation of women in security interventions and integrate gender equality into security policies and practices. Many have initiated projects to empower women and build local capacities and expertise. The study will help domestic institutions map, monitor and evaluate gender security initiatives by providing a robust toolset to: identify and assess the gender security concerns and needs of conflict-affected groups; detect and respond to gaps in existing security provision; and develop best practices for achieving gender security. This will enable positive security to be achieved for both women and men in (post-)conflict areas.

3. International and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) dealing with gender, peace and security issues

Beneficiaries include NGOs who: a) undertake research on gender, peace and security issues (e.g. International Alert, SEESAC, Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces); b) provide support to survivors of war-related and gender-based violence (e.g. Medica Mondiale); and c) advocate on behalf of war affected women (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Track Impunity Always)

By informing and influencing policymakers and practitioners working across these three groups of institutions, the research will impact upon: a) the formulation of effective policies in the area of 'gender security', and enhancement of existing policies to improve their effectiveness; b) conversion of evidence based policy into practice; and c) transformation of organisational structures, culture and practices.

4. Research Participants 

Participants themselves are also likely beneficiaries. A final report of research findings will be disseminated to policymakers, practitioners and researchers in Bosnia and the UK. An accessible summary of key findings will also be prepared for research participants and non-academic users. The dissemination of project results to participants is potentially a source of empowerment, enabling participants to compare and contrast their experiences and concerns with others across the country. Non-academic outputs will be agreed upon via dialogue with participants and are likely to include book and/or website featuring individual stories of WAFFs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N008480/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
