It will benefit academics, as described in the Academic Beneficiaries section - and any further research that is motivated or facilitated by our work may bring wider benefits of its own. But this project also has significant potential benefits directly for policymakers in the UK and elsewhere. At a time when governments in some countries are increasing SSCs in order to reduce budget deficits while others are moving away from employer SSCs amid concerns that they are detrimental to employment, having an understanding of their true effects is vital. Yet surprisingly little is known about how SSCs affect earnings. This project will yield new evidence on the effects of SSCs on earnings in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. In particular, it will shed light on two related questions: the effects of SSCs on individuals' and firms' behaviour (labour supply and labour demand responses) and the economic incidence of SSCs (i.e. who bears the burden of them in the form of lower net income). We will try to distinguish between short-run and long-run effects, look for differences according to who is nominally liable for the tax (i.e. the employee or the employer) and how closely contributions are linked to future benefit entitlements, and explore the institutional features (such as wage bargaining processes, trade unions and minimum wages) that might affect these impacts. Taken as a whole, the research programme will provide an exhaustive analysis of what experience across several countries over several decades can tell us about the impact of SSCs on earnings and what factors the impact depends on, resulting in a deeper understanding and a rich evidence base to inform future policymaking.

Those outside government concerned with good policymaking and the impact of SSCs will also share these benefits: this includes business groups, trades unions, NGOs, think tanks and international organisations such as the OECD. The media and the public in general may benefit as we address issues at the centre of public debate and bring new evidence to the table.

Private firms and individuals might even benefit directly from a better understanding of how future changes to SSCs might affect their costs and incomes respectively - the extent to which the immediate effects of such changes might be offset (or even accentuated) by adjustments to earnings - as well as benefiting from any improvement in policy design.

Part of the benefits of this project will arise as the project goes on, since results from each stage of the project will be published as the later stages proceed. But the bulk of the benefits will be felt towards and after the end of the project, as the full picture becomes available and the different parts can be integrated into a unified narrative, and as the bulk of the dissemination activity described in the Pathways to Impact section takes place.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder

Social security contributions (SSCs) represent a very large share of total taxation in OECD countries (26.1% in 2013), yet empirical studies of their effects on earnings are surprisingly limited. This two-day academic workshop at the Institute for Fiscal Studies will feature 9 papers on the incidence and labour market effects of SSCs, alongside a panel discussion on lessons learnt and directions for future research.

For at least 12-18 months after a reform, it appears that the burden of employee NICs is felt largely by the employee whose earnings are being taxed, while the burden of employer NICs is not: that is, in the short run gross earnings do not adjust to shift the burden/benefit of a change towards or away from the employee in question.

Most employees face frictions (such as adjustment costs or information barriers) which prevent them from fine-tuning their earnings to minimize their NICs liabilities, even in some cases when tax savings worth one sixth of their earnings are available. These frictions are larger for men, full-time workers and the public sector than for women, part-time workers and the retail and hospitality sectors.

However, some workers' earnings do respond to NICs incentives, with the overall size of behavioural responses broadly consistent with consensus estimates for income tax. In particular we find that employees respond to increases in their marginal rate of employee NICs by reducing their hours of work, with average hours of work falling by about 0.2-0.3% within 12-18 months for each 1% fall in their after-NICs hourly wage (holding their total income constant). Working hours do not appear to respond to changes in employer NICs rates in the same way, although employment rates might.

A careful review of the literature does not validate the widespread perception that evidence from cross-country differences in social security contributions supports the hypothesis that both employee and employer SSCs ultimately reduce workers' net earnings. Indeed, we find that this cross-country literature currently provides few clear and consistent conclusions at all, and we propose improvements to the commonly used data and methodology that might make future research in this area more fruitful.

We have also made incremental methodological advances which will help future researchers. These include a method for decomposing bunching in the earnings distribution into hours-of-work and hourly wage components, better estimation of long-run effects in a panel analysis (by use of lags rather than long panels), and uncovering and highlighting important features and limitations of the little-documented Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings dataset which will be useful to other (academic and non-academic) users of the data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that our academic outputs (including several articles being submitted to academic journals, numerous conference presentations, etc.) will stimulate further research building on our findings. We held a major two-day academic workshop at the IFS earlier this year, bringing together junior and senior researchers on this topic from around the world and concluding with a panel discussion on lessons learned and directions for future research, intended to encourage new research and particularly collaborations between attendees.

Our findings are also of direct relevance and interest to tax policy makers. We are in contact with the relevant policy team at HM Treasury and will be holding an event later in the year at which our findings, along with key lessons from other recent research, will be presented and discussed with HM Treasury and others. (Policy events are also being held in partner countries.) 

Detailed international collaboration has revealed surprising variation in how SSC regimes work, so we are writing a non-technical briefing note describing the history and operation of SSCs in the UK which we believe will be a useful primer for both policy-makers and researchers in both the UK and other countries. Again, partners are doing likewise.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E052D28C-5681-4EF4-9003-E579824E98CE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56decab10e3792.51997827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>75B3A9F2-60E7-4C40-B9BD-020BD70BF9B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Incidence of Social Security Contributions in the United Kingdom: Evidence from Discontinuities at Contribution Ceilings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>De Economist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1ec93291033fb46554d744cbc2525eed"><gtr:id>1ec93291033fb46554d744cbc2525eed</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adam S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59035e74575793.68613617</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D0B8DEC-2E59-4840-8E77-3708A16A2351</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contribution Ceilings and the Incidence of Payroll Taxes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>De Economist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1cb9f49349bd9a7e842d0068a35c3262"><gtr:id>1cb9f49349bd9a7e842d0068a35c3262</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alvaredo F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59035e8da6c059.50935886</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K006185/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
