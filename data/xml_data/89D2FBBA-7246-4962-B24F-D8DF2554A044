Invisible Dust's rationale is that many areas of science are invisible (in this case infrared) and so difficult for people to understand. By collaborating with artists who work with many tools : sound, installation, visual and other; the invisible is made visible.

We will engage 15 young people, many from deprived rural areas near Southampton with STFC Space Science and how it is related to climate change through Dr Mortimer's Queen Mary 2 research; the results will be their own creation of art videos containing satellite images and film footage from archives. Following the creation of their artwork, we intend to show it to 20,000 people at the Southampton Film Festival, the Royal Observatory with 1.6 million audiences p.a and on the Queen Mary 2 with 300,000 visitors p.a.

15 young people from Hounsdown School will be provided with science workshops on infrared, the RAL instrumentation on the Queen Mary 2 and the satellite measurement of sea surface temperature with Science Educator, Elizabeth Jeavans. 

They will then develop digital art skills with artist Gary Stewart and use satellite images and the RAL Space archive to edit the images together to create their own videos. These will be shown at the Southampton Film Festival and the Royal Observatory.

We aim for the young people to show their work to the whole school through events and screenings at assemblies which will involve 1215 school students.

We aim to organise a wider schools day for 120 young people from Southampton Schools at the National Oceanography Center.

We intend to show this local audience how STFC funded research is taking place in their area. Since the Queen Mary 2 docks at Southampton regularly, this research has a relevance to their lives and the wider community. There is great emotional attachment and interest in the cruise ships in Southampton; many people work on them and they are a great physical presence when they are in port. 

This community engagement project has been produced by Curator Alice Sharp from Invisible Dust with Dr Mortimer, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at The Royal Observatory and Elizabeth Jeavans formerly education manager at the Royal Society. 

The Wellcome Trust supported Invisible Dust project has been successful in attracting press: this year it has been covered twice on the Guardian website (37 million visitors per month), The Huffington Post (9.8 million visitors per month) and the curator was interviewed on BBC Look East news.

This year Invisible Dust has already worked with RAL to apply to the Leverhulme Foundation for Elizabeth Price to be the first RAL Space Science artist in residence with Dr Hugh Mortimer in 2012. This STFC application is to extend the benefit of the residency.

Invisible Heat aims to be attractive to audiences through:

-Focusing on the interest in the measurement of Climate Change
- Artworks will enable non traditional science audiences to engage
- Involvement of two leading scientists Dr Hugh Mortimer and Dr Marek Kukula
-Appealing and accessible subject matter for young people of a cruise ship 
-Southampton has a population of 240,000 and great interest in the cruise ships, even the Council's website has a register of those in port ( http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/cruise_ship.asp )
-Possibility of filming the Queen Mary 2 and for the exhibition to travel on it
-Partnership with Royal Observatory 
-Partnership with Science Learning Center South East and STEMPOINT at Intech, Winchester to involve Southampton schools and teachers
-Presentation of the exhibition at the Southampton Film Week, which has a youth focus
--Partnership with RAL schools and marketing officer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Marketing and Press

Alice Sharp has extensive experience of press, marketing and working with social media on events and education programmes. 

The project will employ a intern to develop video, blog and social network presence through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. We will also draw from artist Gary Stewart's video and digital media skills to utilise Vimeo and YouTube on the website and partners websites. We will work with photographers to ensure press worthy images to attract news stories. Invisible Heat will employ a press consultant who will ensure that the press release is effective and targets the relevant journalists. 

Engaging their peer group and families

 Key stage 3 is a valuable time to open children to science in new ways. The young people will use social media to inform their families and friends. 

Website

The website will be a key part of this project, giving those who want to continue to engage with the project after visiting the exhibition more information and allowing those who are unable to visit the exhibition access to the scientific research and artwork from the project and host the teaching materials.

The website contents
-Act as a platform for young people or schools to submit images and ideas
-Presentation of the science and related artworks
-Blog the project's development and outcomes
-Connection to Mortimer's QM2 temperature readings and CUNARD webcam in real time
-Profiles the members of the project, such as the artists, Dr Mortimer and the captain on board to show the people behind the project
-Host the teaching resources that will be linked to partners websites

We plan for the project to be promoted through:

1. A link on the Royal Observatory schools page website, through 'exploring Exoplanets:
http://www.nmm.ac.uk/schools/ks3-programmes-at-the-royal-observatory
2. A link on the South East STEMPOINT website and School Science website
3. The South East and National Science Learning Centres website
4. Providing speakers at STEM teachmeet events nationally
5. A website link on SEPnet (South East Physics Network) the network of seven Universities SEPnet, RAL being an associate member
6. Workshop and stand at the National Science Teachers conference to reach 120 teachers

Exhibition

The exhibition itself will be able to continue beyond the lifetime of the project, and the video will be provided for use by STFC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9974</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K002392/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
