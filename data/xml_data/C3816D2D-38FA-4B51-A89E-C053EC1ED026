Classically, the question of boundedness has been considered and extensively studied in particularly smooth environments. The current project is concerned with the development of a theory for singular integrals in rougher environments, namely in Lebesgue spaces where the underlying measure can be quite irregular. This theory is fundamentally motivated by questions such as the David--Semmes Conjecture in Geometric Measure Theory, the characterization of removable singularities for bounded Lipschitz harmonic functions in Complex Analysis, the study of properties of model spaces in Operator Theory and the geometric properties of harmonic measure in any domain in PDE. 

Despite being the source of much international activity and great accomplishments in the last two decades, the theory of singular integrals in rough environments is far from fully developed. The reason is the lack of robust methods that fully exploit the interplay between the cancellation of the operator and the roughness of the underlying measure. The aim of this project is to find such robust methods. The proposed project aims to do so by studying two different but very compelling settings. 

In the first setting, the project aims to characterize the two-weight boundedness for a particular singular integral, the Bergman projection. The Bergman projection is a fundamental operator acting on the space of square integrable analytic functions on the disc. The questions in this setting lie at the interface of Harmonic Analysis and Complex Analysis. It is anticipated that a good understanding of this case would lead to progress on the understanding of more general singular integrals. So far the only fully understood case is that of the Hilbert transform, and the method of proof is particularly designed to suit that and only that operator. 

The second setting lies at the intersection of Harmonic Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory. The main question is concerned with retrieving geometrical properties of the rough underlying measure from the boundedness of non-integer dimensional Riesz transforms. Riesz transforms are fundamental operators in Harmonic Analysis and PDE. The existing results in the area have a dimensional restriction due to the use of a proof strategy that has not found any extensions in other dimensions. The main goal in this setting is to find a robust technique that would be applicable in all non-integer dimensions.

It is expected that the better understanding of the interaction between the cancellation of a singular integral and the underlying rough measure will open up new avenues of research in Harmonic Analysis. The programs proposed would also have impact on the work of researchers in cognate areas such as Function Theory and PDE, among others.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project belongs to the rigorous area of mathematical analysis and as such has potential to create impact on several levels. The most palpable one is on the academic level. This impact would reach researchers working in the three areas pertaining to the project: Harmonic Analysis, Complex Analysis, and Geometric Measure Theory, and it is likely to contribute to the strengthening of the research landscape in the UK by making progress on fundamental questions in the area of mathematical analysis. 

The individuals that would benefit from this project are the applicant, the postdoctoral researcher, and more widely, researchers working in the three core areas of analysis that concern the project. The proposed project will provide the applicant with the time and resources to consolidate her career as an independent researcher of international standing. The postdoctoral researcher associated to this project would benefit from full time guided training on problems that lie at the interface of Harmonic and Complex Analysis, two fundamental areas of analysis. He/She would also create a network of well-established collaborators by interactions with the analysis group at the School of Mathematics at the University of Birmingham and the Harmonic Analysis Community in the UK and abroad. These experiences would help the postdoctoral researcher to develop an independent career of high-standing. 

The project lies at the interface of three core areas of analysis: Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory and Complex Analysis. It is therefore expected that the three communities would benefit from progress made on the questions proposed in the project. More particularly, we expect that the identification of robust methods that reveal the interplay between the cancellation of an operator and the underlying rough measure would open up new avenues of research in Harmonic Analysis and the above mentioned areas. The impact would also extend to other areas of Mathematics such as Operator Theory, Potential Theory, PDE and Mathematical Physics, where applications of the findings are found. There is also emerging evidence that progress within the proposed programs could lead to novel approaches in Data Compression.

The project proposes to tackle a collection of ambitious high-profile questions that are at the forefront of the international analysis research scenery. It is expected that progress in this direction would put the UK at the forefront of cutting-edge research in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101169</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P009239/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
