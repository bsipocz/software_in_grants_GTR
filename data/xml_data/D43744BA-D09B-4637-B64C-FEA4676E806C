The enormous impact that similar future changes could have on the world's society motivates efforts to understand the possible causes of abrupt climate change and the likelihood of future occurrences. Abrupt oscillations in climate, termed Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, occurred frequently during an interval 30 - 60 thousand years ago (ka). Reorganisations of the ocean circulation in the Atlantic (the so-called Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, AMOC) have been invoked to play a dominant role in governing the abrupt nature of D-O events. The AMOC is characterised by warm salty surface water flowing northwards to the northern North Atlantic, where it cools and sinks, forming North Atlantic deepwater (NADW) that flows southwards as a deep return flow. It is the movement of warm water to the high latitudes and the subsequent release of heat to the atmosphere that helps regulates the climate of the North Atlantic. Changes in the AMOC have been related to climate shifts in modelling studies. Yet despite intensive study, we still lack unequivocal physical evidence for a systematic and direct role of deep ocean circulation in abrupt climate change. Here we propose to examine ocean sediments at very high temporal resolution in order to test the involvement of deep circulation changes during past abrupt climate change. The flow of NADW (the deep water limb of the AMOC) forms an intense current at depth along the eastern continental margin of North America. We aim to reconstruct changes in the strength of this current by assessing changes in the grain size of seafloor sediments: very simply, faster current flow causes sorting of the sediment and leads to larger average grain size. Previous studies have suggested that cold intervals are related to reduced deep water formation in the northern North Atlantic and a shoaling of NADW. We will test this hypothesis by detecting intervals of stronger shallow flow using sediment cores at 1.8 km and 3 km depth. Previous work has demonstrated that our chosen core sites and sampling intervals will produce records with a resolution of ~100 years and will therefore be capable of reconstructing the multi-centennial scale D-O oscillations. Pilot study data that we have obtained from an earlier time interval provide confidence in our chosen methods and have yielded very promising results, suggesting a tight coupling between ocean circulation changes and climate. This study addresses a clearly identified gap in our understanding of abrupt climate change. Testing the hypothesis that abrupt climate change is directly related to changes in ocean circulation, and further investigating the differences between different cold events, will represent an important advance in the field of paleoclimatology. The results of this study will be of direct benefit to, for example, climate modellers, and hence will be of importance in enhancing our predictive knowledge of future abrupt climate change. Our study will address directly NERC's current challenge to 'Quantify forces and feedbacks that drive the Earth System' within its Earth System Science Theme, and specifically Challenges 8 and 11 ('Ocean processes and their interaction with the Earth System' and 'What do records of past environments reveal about the operation of the Earth System?).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51349</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our results show that there was a clear response of the DWBC to glacial/interglacial changes, consistent with earlier studies (more vigorous shallow circulation during glacials), however, our data also reveal there was also significant difference between individual glacial periods (i.e. Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, 4 versus MIS 2), suggesting greater complexity than the previously held view of a simple switching between glacial and interglacial modes. Our results also provide direct physical evidence for an extremely vigorous DWBC at shallow depth during the last glacial maximum.
Regarding the shorter timescale of abrupt millennial scale climate change events, the results of our study suggest that the link between the DWBC and climate variability was not always systematic from one event to another (i.e. not a straightforward relationship). However, there are numerous intervals when abrupt climate change events can be related directly to changes in flow speed detected at our sites, suggesting coupling between climate and the DWBC. This is most prominent for the shallowest site (ODP 1055, 1.8 km depth). Therefore it remains possible that by obtaining data from additional sites at intervening and shallower depths to those already studied (1.8-3.0 km depth), a complete picture of the DWBC response may be obtained. Our high resolution data have also enabled us to show that within the warm phases of the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger millennial climate events, there was significant flow variability in the DWBC, which will motivate further investigation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project results will be of great significance to the fields of paleoceanography and paleoclimate (including climate modelling).
