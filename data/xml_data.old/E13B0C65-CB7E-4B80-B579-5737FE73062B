The project will assess whether current investment by farmers in small-scale irrigation might offer a model for broad-based economic growth in rural areas of Africa. 

The research is timely because, after nearly two decades of stalled irrigation investment due to poor performance of irrigation projects in Africa in the 1970s, international commitment to funding African irrigation is growing rapidly as a response to rising food prices and the continuing stagnation of African agricultural productivity. However, funding commitments are yet to be informed by systematic analysis of how irrigation actually works in today's farming contexts in Africa, leading to uncertainty about choices of technology and forms of social organisation needed, and concerns that implementation of large-scale irrigation will repeat past problems and not achieve broad-based economic growth.

This study will respond to this gap by bringing together social science researchers from the UK and irrigation scientists from the Netherlands to work with African researchers in Mozambique and Tanzania on case studies of contemporary irrigation in Africa. The studies will focus on cases where there is evidence that small-scale farmers are investing in irrigation, including the construction of furrows to divert streams, the management of wetter lowlands to grow rice, and the adoption of new low-cost pump technologies and drip irrigation. 

Each study will develop an analysis of these irrigation developments from a local and a national perspective. At a local level, a combination of interviews and questionnaire surveys will be used to identify why farmers do, or do not, invest in irrigation, the kinds of technical and financial support they can obtain, the changes in agricultural productivity they achieve, and the wider social and economic consequences, particularly for people (e.g. women, younger men, and those recently-settled in the area) whose rights to use land and water are typically subordinate to others in hierarchical systems of local governance. 

Case study findings will be presented for discussion by communities participating in the study. At a national level, interviews and workshops with policy-makers in both international development agencies and government, and with non-government organisations and commercial suppliers of irrigation equipment, will be used to provide an analysis of these agencies' perceptions of 'farmer-led' irrigation development and the extent to which such development is supported by policy. The countries selected provide strongly contrasting policy environments, Tanzania having recognised and supported farmer-initiated irrigation in the past whereas Mozambique has not. 

Project findings will be disseminated internationally through open access publication in peer-reviewed academic journals, and through engagement with an international advisory group including academic and 'end user' representatives. At a national level, the project will undertake workshops with officials and policy-makers on irrigation in both Tanzania and Mozambique both during inception and after completion of the local-level fieldwork on irrigation case studies. Research findings will also contribute to curriculum development by the African research partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will engage key stakeholders at four levels: national policy-makers, local users, African academics, and international academic/users.

National policy-makers. In each of the countries in which the research is to be undertaken we will convene a series of &amp;quot;strategic workshops&amp;quot; at inception, mid-term and 6 months before the end of the project. At each workshop the research team (Manchester/WUR and African research partners) as well as key policy makers and technical advisors on irrigation will be able to assess and discuss the project activities and findings. Workshop outcomes will inform research design and data collection activities (at inception, and mid-term) and data interpretation and research findings (in the final workshop).

Local users: At a local level, we will seek opportunities to engage with farmers' organisations in discussing the research findings, particularly in terms of comparing different irrigation approaches and their relevance for different groups (e.g. women and youth). These meetings will also involve staff from the local irrigation and agricultural administration so that to raise their awareness -and readiness to engage with- farmer-led irrigation innovation and development.

African academics. In each of the case study countries, the research will involve the Manchester and Wageningen researchers working with African co-investigators from higher education and research institutions: - ISPM in Mozambique, NM-AIST in Tanzania
This will offer opportunities for capacity building: through collaborative research design and data collection, and the possible use of data collected by junior researchers for a PhD in a local university (the PhD will be co-supervised by staff from Manchester/WUR). The research will also provide the basis for seminars and curriculum development in ISPM (Mozambique) and NM-AIST (Tanzania), particularly in reframing how irrigation is perceived by students (notably, in their awareness of local 'artisanal' adaptations of more formal irrigation technology) and in interdisciplinary methodologies for irrigation appraisal, particularly with respect to understanding broader social and economic effects.

International academics/users. early publication of research results in high quality journal papers will challenge current thinking by re-framing debates about the potential options of investment in irrigation (the last 6 months of the project are specifically devoted to this activity). These papers will emphasise cross-disciplinary analysis and accessibility to non-specialist readers by targeting Open Access publication in key high-impact journals (World Development, Journal of Peasant Studies, Journal of Agrarian Change, Water Alternatives). Findings will be disseminated also by conference presentations and via shorter briefing notes to mailing lists and via web pages. The project will also use a high-level &amp;quot;advisory group&amp;quot; to guide the implementation of the project and offer opportunities for the project to inform international policy agendas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>437898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Directions for Irrigation Development in Tanzania, Dar-es-Salaam, 2 September 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9001FCF-435D-4DE1-8E9E-9C8656B77B79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop &amp;quot;New Directions for Irrigation Development in Tanzania&amp;quot; was proposed by the SAFI (Studying African Farmer-led Irrigation) research project, in partnership with two other projects also funded by the DFID-ESRC Growth Programme: &amp;quot;Assessing Models of Public Private Partnership for Irrigation Development in Africa&amp;quot; (led by IFPRI, Washington DC) and

This research project, funded by ESRC - DFID, brings together a team of social science researchers and irrigation scientists from the UK, Europe and Africa. The project seeks to understand if current investment by famers in small-scale irrigation can offer a model for broad-based economic growth in rural areas of Africa.

A clear systematic analysis of existing initiatives will inform policies to generate growth in agricultural productivity, give a greater understanding of social and economic consequences, of changing land and water rights, and the choices of technical and financial support required.


Fieldwork has started in Mozambique at Ruaca-Chirodzo, Vanduzi and Nhamatande. In Tanzania the research team is working in Moshi District, at Mandaka Mnono, Kahe and Mijongwene

The project team have started a series of policy-maker interviews with Government and non-Government agencies to discuss perceptions of irrigation, irrigation statistics, future irrigation development, and policy priorities.

Plans are underway for the SAFI Project's mid-term meetings in summer 2016 in Maputo, and Dar es Salaam.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5A6ACA17-9403-4FF8-8AA4-06AEA07C0881</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d4dc3ece32e3.07532209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77E5B2BD-AA69-4144-9529-1594ABF59C75</gtr:id><gtr:title>African farmer-led irrigation development: re-framing agricultural policy and investment?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of Peasant Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7fa7d8608c54d3092d762aaf4d3549b0"><gtr:id>7fa7d8608c54d3092d762aaf4d3549b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodhouse P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e007a6aca525.22446520</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L012391/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
