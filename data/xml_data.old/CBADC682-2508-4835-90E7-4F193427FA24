This is typically addressed by employing unsaturated, carbon-rich molecules, which now feature widely in conducting polymers (so-called molecular wires) and as small molecular components of common organic electronics such as OLEDs, field-effect transistors (OFETs) and photovoltaics (OPVs). The incorporation of metals and/or heteroatoms (e.g. nitrogen) into such molecules offers an effective means of enhancing and controlling their photo-activity and conductivity and is thus the subject of significant on-going research. Particular current interest surrounds the use of phosphorus-containing molecules ('phosphacarbons') in such roles, which is being widely investigated. However, the use of phosphacarbons in this context has not yet permeated the organometallic regime; this is due in part to a lack of suitable synthetic methodology and perceived inaccessibility of some of the simplest organometallic phosphacarbons. 

Recently, the PI has developed the first compounds to incorporate the simplest phosphacarbon fragment 'CP' (cyaphide, the direct analogue of cyanide) as part of a linearly conjugated chain, exploiting an organometallic scaffold. Significant involvement and influence of the cyaphide unit is manifest in the electronic and photolytic behaviour of these compounds (compared with classical carbon-based systems), rendering them of particular interest. This project will build upon these preliminary advances, developing this class of compounds toward achieving electrochemical stability and reversibility of metal-centred redox processes, and exploring their conductive (and photo-absorptive) properties. Further synthetic routes will be investigated and developed to enable access to a broader range of compounds, based on modified organometallic scaffolds, increasing available control over electronic features. The scope for developing more complex phosphacarbon derivatives (e.g. the CC-CP moiety) will also be explored. This project will, therefore, develop the fundamental synthetic science and physical understanding to underpin (directly and indirectly) future developments in the expanding field of applied molecular electronics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks fundamental underpinning chemistry to contribute to a growth area of modern physical sciences research, viz. the development of molecular scale electronic components. As such, while the initial impact (at outset) is inevitably academic, this will contribute to sustained future R&amp;amp;D in the academic, industrial and commercial sectors, thus permeating the entire socioeconomic spectrum. 

Immediate
An immediate impact will be the training of the PDRA and students (PhD and masters) within the PI's group in the methods of modern organometallic and main-group chemistry, directly contributing to maintaining the UK science skills-base, in line with national science policy. The PI's position within a respected (research-led) teaching institution, also offers scope for achieving broader exposure of the scientific developments, both to undergraduate students (via lectures, research symposia, research placements) and at pre-university level (outreach programme, see pathways to impact) thus contributing to sustained recruitment of talented youngsters to STEM subjects.

The scientific outputs, initially disseminated through high-impact publication and conference presentations, will establish and affirm the UK lead in an emerging research area, while consolidating existing strengths.

Short-Medium Term
The project will establish a foundation of scientific data that, through appropriate dissemination, will have cross-cutting academic impact (see academic beneficiaries), while underpinning a sustained future (initially academic) R&amp;amp;D programme within the UK. The considerable potential for elucidating favourable electron/hole transport (conductive) properties and photo-activity within the targeted molecules contributes directly to the Sussex Chemistry departmental initiative in 'clean energy' and offers the realistic prospect of generating interest within the industrial sector. Collaborative interaction with UK and international companies can be realistically expected toward the end of the project life-time, establishing the follow-on research programme. This process will be managed through the Sussex Innovation Centre, ensuring any commercially exploitable IP is secured within the UK. 

Long Term
The creation of knowledge feeds directly into future scientific development and advancement, both fundamental and applied. Given the well-established importance of pi-conjugated materials in modern consumer electronics (OLEDs, OFETs), and particular recent emphasis on utilising phosphorus in such molecules, knowledge generated from this project can be expected to contribute, directly and indirectly, to future developments in this applied field. As such, long-term societal and economic impact and enhancement can be realistically expected over the coming decades.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>348115</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organometallic Conference (Melbourne)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>300A0C02-551A-4108-9A27-A76D6DA6D679</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by the PI (Crossley) to the International Conference on Organometallic Chemistry in Melbourne, July 2016, within the session &amp;quot;Reactivity, Structure and Theory&amp;quot;, intended to engage a broad organometallic audience with cross-disciplinary interest, composed of academics, post-doctoral researchers and post-graduate students. The talk precipitated questions from several post-graduates, and more extended discussions with internationally based academics, some of which progressed nascent collaborative opportunities. 

The interest inspired by the presentation is underlined by it precipitating an impromtu invitation from one audience member to make a further presentation at Macquarie University the following week, during a planned brief visit to Sydney.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc0c1d62dd46.50155519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.icomc2016.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Seminar (Macquarie University, Sydney)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC2C7964-9443-45BE-A501-A3B9D58B46C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prompted by a presentation at the international conference on organometallic chemistry, the PI (Crossley) was invited to deliver the same presentation to a small group of researchers (students and post-docs) and Macquarie University, as part of a specialist seminar programme intended to broaden awareness of the wider research field.

As a largely academic audience the primary impact was broadening awareness of our research - with specific focus on the linearly conjugated organometallics, and in particular introducing this across the traditional disciplinary lines, and to post-graduate students. The seminar precipitated several questions form academics and student, and more in depth discussions with several post-graduates over the following day. Subsequent contact with some of these students has illustrated the interest generated by the talk, and the new perspective upon their own research (that lies tangential to our work) that it has inspired.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc106d120211.65165696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Seminar (RMIT, Melbourne)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78A3A638-AF24-4C34-B651-E43E255C0B64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited research seminar by the PI (Crossley) at RMIT Unviersity in Melbourne (coordinated with a conference visit). The research focus of RMIT is very applied, thus representing a key target audience sector to address in order to facilitate future, more application-driven impact from the work. The primary impact of the seminar was thus the successful engagement of the audience, which was evidence from the breadth of questions fielded. Additionally, there was specific interest from individuals engaged in photovoltaics and opto-electronics, opening another nascent possibility for collaboration - indeed, they had specific interest in some of our molecules, and contact will be maintained.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc0eb2b62e92.61335603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD2F290E-49E9-4290-A71C-243CA5C4A3D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Through-conjugation of two phosphaalkyne ('C[triple bond, length as m-dash]P') moieties mediated by a bimetallic scaffold.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/66084b3ee929c54c2a46472a5bf96e17"><gtr:id>66084b3ee929c54c2a46472a5bf96e17</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Leech MC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b526c1725.67014692</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N016785/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A097DA61-EABD-4142-9025-D4EA5CA63082</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Co-ordination Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
