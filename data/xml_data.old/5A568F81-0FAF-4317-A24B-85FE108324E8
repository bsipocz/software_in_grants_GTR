Traditionally scientists have tried to find better ways to kill the microbes; however this approach has not fully worked, and may never eradicate the problem. Whilst carrying out BBSRC-funded work on this topic, we utilised methods we had developed to provide an alternative strategy for managing these infections. Our &amp;quot;MicroSensor&amp;quot; approach, involves a minature compartment close to the device surface, producing a strongly visible colour change when infected, thus enabling earlier clinical interventions to prevent serious infection occurring. 
Here we plan to show the MicroSensor is reliable, that its sensitivity can be controlled, and that it functions when used in a contact lens case or wound dressing, the applications closest to market. Major medical device companies have indicated these data would be required to convince them to co-develop the technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>178001</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Webcast interview at ICAAC 2015 - a major antimicrobials conference run by the American Society for Microbiology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1430E8B0-9542-4FD6-A124-3C99841F7102</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The BBSRC project outputs were selected as one of any 6 of the 3000 conference abstracts to be featured via a 30 min webcast live interview with Prof Dobson and Dr Gonvindji-Bhatt (PI and research associate respectively on the BBSRC funded project).

Microbiological monitoring is especially important for long-term users of medical devices. Medical device use is one of the highest risk factors for nosocomial infection, affecting nearly 2 million patients and killing approximately 90,000 annually in the US alone. At risk groups include patients with chronic wounds, such as diabetic leg ulcers, or those requiring long-term invasive medical device intervention, such as kidney dialysis patients.

Microbiosensor Ltd is addressing this need for improved infection monitoring head-on, by offering the market unique, robust and inexpensive diagnostic solutions. Our devices provide continuous safety monitoring, enhancing patient care by allowing earlier intervention than is currently possible. This will improve treatment outcomes and ultimately help in the fight against multi-drug resistance, by improving the management of the remaining arsenal of effective antibiotic drugs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F82FBC5-BE37-4FA8-8AB8-2EF61F564AD6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Microbiosensor has secured around &amp;pound;4m funding to develop its technology.
