Mating is the outcome of successful courtship, and courtship depends on communication between males and females. Recently, we found that a large part of the olfactory system in the fruit fly Drosophila, an insect that is used widely in biological research, appears to be dedicated to smelling fly odours. This suggests olfactory sex pheromones may play an important role in its reproductive behaviour. The aim of this project is to identify new olfactory sex pheromones in Drosophila and to analyze their function in courtship. In the flies' antennae, odours interact with odor receptors, encoded by the Odor receptor gene (Or) family. These odor receptors are expressed in the membranes of sensory neurons. The neurons encode information about the quality, intensity and temporal characteristics of odours in electrical signals. The olfactory sensory neurons are located in the antenna of the fly in structures called sensilla, and we can record the electrical activity of the neurons through an electrode placed into the sensilla. We found that trichoid sensilla, which are one morphological type, hold neurons that respond to fly odours. There are twelve Or genes expressed in the trichoids. We will use a previously developed assay system to test each of the receptors' sensitivity to fly odours. We will then identify the components in the fly odours that activate the receptors. Finally in behavioural experiments, we will explore how the flies use their receptors to distinguish suitable from unsuitable mates. Fruit flies belong to the order of the Diptera. The Diptera also include biting flies and mosquitoes that transmit serious diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and trypanosomiasis ('sleeping sickness' in humans). An understanding of sex pheromone communication in one fly species may elucidate general principles of Dipteran courtship, and may lead to new strategies of insect control by giving us the tools to disrupt the insects' reproductive behaviour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although it is well established that Diptera such as flies and mosquitoes use their sense of smell to find hosts for feeding, very little is known about the role of odours in their sexual communication. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is experimentally tractable and we will use it initially as a model to understand principles of courtship that may also operate in medically and economically important Diptera. Using a new stimulus method, whereby the stimulus is loaded onto a capillary that is brought into the vicinity of the fly to mimic the proximity of interacting insects, we recently showed that a large proportion (~20%) of its olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) respond specifically to fly odours and we identified several receptors that mediate these responses. The aim of this project is to identify the components in fly odour that stimulate the receptors, and then to determine the contribution of each candidate sex pheromone component to the courtship process. Each receptor will be expressed in an in vivo expression system. Extracts of flies will be used as a source of candidate sex pheromone components. Extracts and their chromatographically separated fractions will be assayed on each receptor to identify ligands. We will test a model of how the receptors might be used to distinguish suitable from unsuitable partners, by changing the amount of their ligands on the partners' bodies in courtship assays or by interfering with the perception of the ligands through the expression of tetanus toxin light chain under control of the Or promoters in the OSNs. Outcomes are the identities of novel pheromones and improved models of the olfactory basis of mate recognition in Drosophila.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319280</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings thus far have been used in education during public engagement events starting early on in the grant period.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a member of the Diptera. This is a group of two-winged insects that includes important vectors of disease, such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies, as well as agricultural pests such as the Spotted Wing Drosophila. This study improves our understanding of the olfactory system in Drosophila, and may extrapolate to other Diptera and to other systems. We have shown that sensory neurons grouped together in units in the Drosophila antenna mutually inhibit each other. A neuron ectopically expressing a pheromone receptor sensitive to male and female odours was strongly inhibited when an adjacent neuron was activated. One explanation for the excitation of one neuron and the inhibition of its neighbour is that the odour acts on both neurons, but elicit responses in opposite directions. An alternative explanation is that the odour excites one neuron, and it is the excitation of the neuron that leads to inhibition of its neighbour. Excitation of a neuron using an optogenetic tool, whereby expression of Channelrhodopsin-2 makes the neuron's activity light inducible, also had an inhibitory effect arguing against a mechanism that involves molecular interactions with the odour. Rather, we showed that the inhibitory mechanism relies on current flow through the extracellular fluid, and we propose that it supports initial processing of odor information. We found that similar interactions occur in the taste system, and suggest these ephaptic interactions may operate among grouped cells also in other systems. After having found a mechanism that may affect odour coding in the pheromone and general odour system, we are examining the hydrocarbon profiles of flies and testing components on ectopically expressed receptors to identify best ligands. Our results suggest the ligand for the receptor Or47b is one of the minor components in the hydrocarbon blend. The ligand for Or47b may be one of the key olfactory attractants during Drosophila courtship. A paper reporting the results of the study is in preparation for (re)submission; two reviews have been published (see publications).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An odour's effect is not only through the neuron it activates, but also through activity changes induced in adjacent neurons. There is an increasing awareness of the importance of ephaptic interactions in processing of neuronal information, and this study may be taken forward by others through further research into ephaptic contributions to processing. Cuticular hydrocarbons of low volatility were thought to be sensed solely through the taste system; that these pheromonal candidates may be sensed not only through taste but also through olfaction could inform the design of traps using these chemicals for monitoring insects, including pest insects such as Drosophila suzukii, in crop protection.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AC1CBF46-CFDC-4E35-A6DE-27FE8E5697DD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546335eb92a175.21714551</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6B2008B1-9544-4B56-BD70-F54C825B7EB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inhibition among olfactory receptor neurons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in human neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c0375ce53909f8112392f7483364b7d"><gtr:id>9c0375ce53909f8112392f7483364b7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Van der Goes van Naters W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-5161</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545e22e4b1e586.73048946</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6FBE2F28-DBA6-4F72-9328-75D832224BC9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Neurobiology of Chemical Communication, Chapter 6</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c0375ce53909f8112392f7483364b7d"><gtr:id>9c0375ce53909f8112392f7483364b7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Van der Goes van Naters W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4665-5341-5</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545e2704e8fab7.07610658</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/H002758/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
