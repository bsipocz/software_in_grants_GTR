Levies on copying devices and copying media are now prevalent throughout the EU (with the exception of the UK, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg), in North America (Canada, and to a limited extent the United States) and in Japan. In the EU alone, collection exceeds 500 million Euro per year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite their wide adoption, rationale and economic consequences of levy systems are little understood. It is unclear what incentives, if any, levies are supposed to provide, and who are the precise empirical beneficiaries. It remains unresolved if a levy should be simply analysed as a (regressive) tax, or if there can be efficiencies that are similar to the transaction cost rationale of blanket licences. There may also be dynamic effects, from increased access to copyright materials for follow-on innovation. In addition, a number of non-economic arguments are frequently made, focussing on the reward of creators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The placement fellowship in the Intellectual Property Office will examine:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>the economics of different types of pricing (eg percentage of revenue, percentage of retail price, per user fee)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>issues arising from tax points (eg copying media, equipment, traffic)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>issues arising from distribution schemes (eg between various categories of legal rights, between authors and publishers, between major and minor earners, effects of earning thresholds)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>crossborder trade effects of levy schemes.&lt;br />&lt;/li>

There are dramatic differences between countries in the methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and allocating beneficiaries of the levy. There are levies on blank media in 22 EU countries, on MP3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries, on personal computers in four countries. Revenues collected per capita vary between ?0.02 (Romania) and ?2.6 (France). The distribution of levy revenues to recording artists is less than ?0.01 per album.

? These variations cannot be explained by an underlying concept of economic harm to rightholders from private copying.

? The scope of consumer permissions under the statutory exceptions for private copying within the EU vary, and generally do not match with what consumers ordinarily understand as private activities.

? In levy countries, the costs of levies as an indirect tax are not always passed on to the consumer. In competitive markets, such as those for printers, manufacturers of levied goods appear to absorb the levy. There appears to be a pan-European retail price range for many consumer devices regardless of levy schemes (with the exception of Scandinavia).

? In non-levy countries, such as the UK, a certain amount of private copying is already priced into retail purchases. For example, right holders have either explicitly permitted acts of format shifting, or decided not to enforce their exclusive rights. Commercial practice will not change as a result of introducing a narrowly conceived private copying exception.

? A more widely conceived exception that would cover private activities that take place in digital networks (such as downloading for personal use, or non-commercial adaptation and distribution within networks of friends) may be best understood not as an exception but as a statutory licence. Such a licence could include state regulated payments with levy characteristics as part of a wider overhaul of the copyright system, facilitating the growth of new digital services.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Influencing UK and EU copyright policy. The Report &amp;quot;Private Copying and Fair Compensation: An empirical study of copyright levies in Europe&amp;quot; is cited in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth (2011, p. 116), in the government's response to Hargreaves and in the 2011/12 copyright consultation.



Interestingly, the report is cited by both proponents and opponents of copyright levies. The opponents focus on one part of the report's Conclusion: &amp;quot;Within the current constraints of EU, the UK's economically efficient option appears to be the de minimis argument: a certain amount of copying is already priced into the first retail purchase.&amp;quot;



For an example of this reading, see Nokia's discussion paper: Recent Trends in Alternatives to Copyright Levies (7 March 2012): &amp;quot;Just before Christmas 2011 the UK government published proposals to introduce a statutory private copying exception for the digital age, while at the same time rejecting copyright levies, following the Recommendations in Professor Martin Kretschmer's report on 'Private Copying and Fair Compensation' (Annex, Reference 4), commissioned by the UK-IPO, claimed to be the first official empirical study of copyright levies in Europe which concluded that the levies system across Europe is 'deeply irrational'.&amp;quot;



The proponents report on a different part of the Conclusion: &amp;quot;Users should be able to buy a licence that allows them to download and pass on copyright material in a way that would currently break the law.&amp;quot; (Report by Out-law.com, 20 October 2011)
