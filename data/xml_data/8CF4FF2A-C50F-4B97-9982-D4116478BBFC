Such fragments are preserved in waterlogged and damp deposits and can tell us immense detail about how humans lived in prehistory, how they affected the landscape when they moved to a farming way of life and destroyed the wildwood, and how the development of urban centres changed the appearance of the landscape forever. Such an exercise has not been previously undertaken from a fossil insect perspective, in the context of current archaeological and palaeoenvironmental debates, nor has the research been made readily accessible to the non-specialist. The geographical focus of the work will be on the British Isles, where the majority of research in this field has been undertaken, although records from elsewhere in Europe and further a field will be drawn upon where relevant.\n\nThe central theme of the book is concerned with the development of the 'cultural landscape'. The cultural landscape is the environment which surrounds us and which has been shaped by our interactions with all the constituent parts of that environment. It is the habitat that the human race has created through conflict and cooperation over thousands of years, the product of human interaction with nature and is as much part of the story of our existence as that of the physical landscape. The book will build upon the author's doctoral research entitled 'The evolution of the Holocene wetland landscape of the Humberhead Levels from a fossil insect perspective', drawing upon case studies therein, published and unpublished research by the applicant, but also other archaeological investigations undertaken by specialists in this field over the last fifty or more years.\n\nThe review will be underpinned by a through and robust re-evaluation of the timing of events and differences at the national and regional scale. The sorts of questions which will be addressed are, for instance, what are the differences between the development of the British and Irish landscapes? Although superficially very similar landscapes, their development has been subject to different physical and socio-political forces. What are the differences between regions of Britain, such as southern and northern England? Do these tell us something about how these landscapes developed and were manipulated by humans? What were the major impacts with the development of agriculture and urbanisation? How do results compare with other archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data? What are the major challenges to our understanding of the fossil insect fauna? What are its limitations and the areas which require addressing further, both in terms of space and time coverage and methodologies? \n\nThere will be no primary collection of data. The project will utilise published and unpublished material from the applicant's PhD thesis and other unpublished Irish work, as well as drawing upon a selection of published sites by other workers. The book will follow a chronological narrative, opening with the end of the last ice age and following key stages in the development of the cultural landscape and finishing in the 18th century, the date of the most recent information available. \n\nThere will be two outputs to the project: a single authored book and a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. The book will be primarily aimed at other archaeologists (including but not exclusively environmental archaeologists), landscape historians and those interested in Quaternary environmental change and students of these disciplines. The paper will be aimed at archaeological scientists and will summarise the major trends and findings of the project. The programme of research is already advanced and outputs will be complete by the end ofthe sabbatical period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23544</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>66000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (DELNI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>DEL PhD awards: Floodplain-mire interactions and palaeoecology: implications for wetland ontogeny and Holocene climate change</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of Northern Ireland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5706FD72-D588-4DDA-A620-DAB8B35C16FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464c2a1a26da0.10966791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Living Landscapes: exploring Neolithic Ireland and its wider context</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>National Roads Authority</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D4B7DBC0-CADE-43C4-ACE7-F2D3B3E9E319</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ebde5905ebde59a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>236477</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Cultivating Societies: Assessing the Evidence for Agriculture in Neolithic Ireland.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2010-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Heritage Council (Ireland)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9A9DACF5-C307-483B-A317-8F0B32019F4C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec6cf8e5ec6cfa2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The results from this work have informed two areas; there is a much greater awareness of the role of grazers in structuring the landscape and the modern conservation implications of these. The findings have been quite widely cited and been used to argue for different concepts around the development of the cultural landscape in Britain. Secondly, the review work revealed important insights around the formation of the cultural landscape during the Neolithic and especially periods of clearance and re-afforestation during the middle Neolithic. Subsequently, the research funded by the AHRC award was used to feed into a research project focused on the Neolithic in Ireland and its landscape impacts. This work was funded by the Irish Heritage Council. This work established re-afforestation phases in Ireland during the middle Neolithic which have now gone on to be found at other sites across the British Isles. This AHRC award formed the starting point of this subsequent work on the Irish Neolithic which has gained much national and international interest and publications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F3D89543-829F-4DE8-B05C-6AD21F243BDC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54649d84bd6cd8.05953621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aim of this research project was to produce the first comprehensive synthesis of the Holocene fossil insect record for the British Isles, providing an account of the development of the &amp;quot;cultural landscape&amp;quot;.



A dataset of all published British &amp;amp; Irish Holocene &amp;amp; earlier Quaternary sites has been constructed. This revealed the geographical spread of sites, periods and types available, 409 in total: 93 earlier Quaternary sites; 45 late glacial sites; 67 early-mid Holocene (Mesolithic-Neolithic 9500-2000 cal BC) &amp;amp; 204 late Holocene sites (Bronze Age 2000 cal BC /modern). About half of the present fauna had established itself during the late glacial, especially before major afforestation during the early Holocene. Between 9,500-6000 cal BC, records reflect the development of natural woodland, structurally complex and rich ecosystems, supporting a varied and biodiverse saproxylic fauna, including species that no longer live in Britain or Ireland. Insects reflect the pollen evidence for the importance of oak, hazel, pine, willow and birch. By c. 6000-4000 cal BC, woodland taxa are at their most important (&amp;gt;20-40%), there are significant local variations suggesting that there was much patchiness of the landscape, especially in the major floodplains (e.g. Trent and Thames). 



After early Holocene highs (10-27%) open &amp;amp; pasture indicators are low (5-10%), and there is an increase in dense canopy taxa. Between 4000-2000 cal BC, the effects of localised deforestation are seen. After initial openings in the early Neolithic, some forest regeneration seems to have happened in the Middle Neolithic, followed by deforestation in the later Neolithic and early Bronze age, suggesting that Neolithic agriculture must have been localised and small scale in Britain, in contrast to Ireland. Synanthropic faunas from several Scottish Neolithic waterlogged sites show the effects of settled living at this early stage. Settlement &amp;amp; agriculture affected alluviation in floodplains (e.g. Thames, Avon, Trent), intensifying through the later prehistoric and Roman periods, spreading into small catchments (e.g. Torne, Idle). By the Bronze and Iron ages, the range of sites is greater than previously. Faunas have high levels of pasture &amp;amp; dung beetles (up to 45%), very few tree associates (&amp;lt; 5%) and agricultural landscapes are associated with many of the major river valleys. Many specialist saproxylic taxa have extirpated. There are apparent differences between the British and Irish records which relate to different cultural histories. Several settlement sites include high levels of synanthropes, emphasising the continuous nature of occupation on sites. In the Iron Age, continuing into the Roman period, many faunas show great uniformity, reflecting the lack of diverse habitats and the man-made landscape. Faunal diversity associated with open landscapes of the Bronze Age had declined. 



One of the effects of Roman invasion of Britain was to introduce a range of exotic species associated with military supplies and later trade, including a new range of synanthropes (pests of stored products) and the oriental cockroach. During the Viking and Medieval period we see the development of major towns, from which large, abundant populations of insects have been studied. There are virtually no natural or semi-natural sites covering this period or indeed the following Medieval and Post-Medieval Period. Vestiges of ancient woodland appear to have survived in some areas (e.g. Humberhead Levels), probably because the Medieval Forest Chase provided important refugia, whilst in Ireland colonial deforestation had devastating impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The focus on landscape is likely to be of interest to heritage and nature conservation agencies and provides a slightly different focus to other academic volumes concerned with the Holocene which may be appealing to children or to provide a different view of the landscape. 

The biogeographic data contained in the book, especially that concerned with species extinctions and declines may also be of wider interest to nature conservation agencies. My particular attention to the differences between Britain and Ireland may also be of wider interest.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD6CAF32-0215-467B-A5C9-11E4293D5732</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5450481898.5708837758e1b8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/nicola-whitehouse</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42C62ED2-68DB-454D-BFE0-532A46C8142E</gtr:id><gtr:title>How fragmented was the British Holocene wildwood?
