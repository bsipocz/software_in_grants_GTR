At certain frequencies of vibration, standing waves may be formed. These frequencies are called eigenvalues, and the shapes of the standing waves are called eigenfunctions. What is remarkable is that these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions serve as a model for the energy levels and wave-functions of complex quantum mechanical systems, if statistical indicators are considered such as the distribution of spacings between levels. This correspondence is largely a numerical observation, but has been supported by heuristic and rigorous evidence.The present proposal aims to understand rigorously some aspects of eigenfunction shape for quantum graphs, with the intention of using the understanding gained to make predictions about other complex quantum systems. One of the central mysteries of semi-classical quantum mechanics is to understand how wave-functions behave at large energies. It is known that almost all of the wave-functions for quantum systems which have chaotic classical dynamics become uniformly distributed in the large energy limit. This means that for a quantum mechanical particle prepared in such a state, the probability of finding it in any region is merely proportional to the volume of that region. What is yet far from being fully understood is the behaviour of possible exceptional wave-functions. One possibility is that they do not even exist; that is, all wave-functions become uniformly distributed. Another possibility is that the wave-functions become enhanced around unstable classical periodic orbits, which would be very far from uniform distribution. This is an important question, since physical intuition does not give a clear prediction one way or the other. Moreover there is mathematical evidence pointing to both outcomes, in different systems. My belief is that quantum graphs will be a suitable testing ground for these questions, avoiding the technical difficulties associated with complex quantum systems.Using quantum graphs as models has already resulted in some successes in understanding the distribution of spacings between energy levels. I hope to make similar progress in understanding localisation in quantum wave-functions. This will build upon the 70-plus year history of graph-like models as key tools in understanding spectral features of mathematical chemistry and physics. Recent progresses in semi-classical structures in quantum wave-functions emphasise the timeliness of the proposed project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The broader impact of the proposed research will be most strongly felt by other researchers in the immediate and adjacent areas to the project. These comprise researchers working in mathematical physics and spectral theory in the first category, and theoretical physicists in the second category. This impact comes from two directions: firstly, the universal nature of quantum physics means that results concerning statistical behaviours of wave-functions proved for quantum graphs also can apply to other complex quantum systems. Secondly, quantum graphs themselves can often be used as models for waves travelling in thin structures. This second aspect is part of a subject which is increasingly becoming known as 'nano-mathematics'. In order that these impacts are realised we will adopt the following strategy: (1) Strategically publish our findings in appropriate mathematical and physical journals. In the case where the audience for our outputs will be split between two or more research communities, we shall publish our outcomes in formats suitable for all, and submit them to the highest quality journals. (2) We will disseminate our findings at international conferences relevant to the subject area, and post our pre-prints on publicly-accessibly servers to maximise their visibility. (3) Simplified versions of the projects in the proposal can be used as undergraduate research projects. (4) Part of the proposed work will be conducted as part of a formal collaboration. The PI will maintain close, informal relations with his circle of contacts. This will help publicise the research, and ensure that it is guided by the latest methods and thinking. (5) The PDRA will be fully trained in the research aspects of the project, and will benefit from the variety of professional development courses offered to research staff at Loughborough University.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231918</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have proved a quantum ergodicity theorem for regular quantum graphs quantised with boundary conditions that prohibit back-scattering.
