Interactions</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L006979/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The chicken is native to Southeast Asia but over the last 8,000 years it has been transported by people around the world - no other livestock species is so widely established. The chicken's eastward spread from Asia to the Americas has been the subject of many studies; however, its diffusion to the West has received much less attention. There have been a few small-scale surveys documenting the spread of chickens across Europe but there has been no comprehensive review about the rapidity of the spread and its cultural and environmental impacts. No ancient (and little modern) DNA work has been published for European chickens, nor have there been any isotopic studies focussed specifically upon their diets or whether they were bred locally or traded. Given the social and cultural significance of this species (whether as a provider of meat, eggs or feathers, its widespread use in cockfighting or its association with ritual, magic and medicine), a detailed analysis of the natural and cultural history of chickens in Europe is long overdue and this has genuine potential to provide cultural data of the highest quality and relevance for a range of disciplines and audiences.

To realise this potential and elucidate the circumstances and meaning of the westward spread of the chicken from the late prehistoric period to modern times our trans-disciplinary team - composed of experts of international renown in European archaeology, anthropology, genetics, zooarchaeology, and other branches of archaeological science - will integrate the evidence from their specialist studies to answer the following questions:

1) When, how and why did domestication and the early husbandry of chicken take place in Europe?

2) How rapidly did chickens spread into different parts of Europe and how was this diffusion linked to population movements, trade or cultural changes?

3) When did poultry and egg production emerge and how intensively were chickens exploited for these products in different regions and periods?

4) When and where did modern chicken breeds develop?

5) How have chickens changed society and culture in antiquity and in modern times?

6) Can evidence from the past be used to transform modern practices of chicken management?

Research will be carried out at the Universities of Bournemouth, Nottingham, Roehampton, Durham, Leicester and York to investigate these questions. This work will be supported by an interactive research network &amp;quot;The Chicken Coop&amp;quot; (www.chickenco-op.net) that has already been established. In addition to the Chicken Coop members, we will work with colleagues from many parts of the UK and continental Europe, who will supply information and samples for analysis. Our research will directly involve groups drawn from beyond the academic community (including schoolchildren, chicken breeders and artists), with whom we will collaborate to produce physical and virtual art exhibitions. These will complement a series of museum exhibitions 'The Chicken Trail' that, together, will tell the story of the chicken's domestication and spread across Europe. 

The research will generate a large number of papers for academic journals and provide other publications and outputs aimed at a wider audience. The project aims to use the study of chickens to demonstrate how studies in the arts, humanities and sciences can be fused together for the benefit of both academic and non-academic communities. Chickens play a major role in modern European societies. This project will greatly increase our knowledge of the history of this exotic species and allow those who keep chickens to appreciate how this knowledge can be used to the benefit of the management of chickens in the present and future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>All team members, from PI to PhD students, will contribute to the Impact programme, ensuring that they not only gain skills and experience in communicating research but also appreciate how the arts and sciences can be fused creatively for social benefit.
Our pilot project highlighted four groups with whom we wish to engage; they will not only benefit from the project but will be actively involved in it: 

1) General public. Chickens are as much a part of Europe's cultural heritage as the more visible monuments of Stonehenge or the Coliseum but, because they are abundant and widespread, their cultural significance is overlooked. Yet it is their very familiarity that makes chickens an engaging cultural and educational resource. To communicate their importance we will commission a documentary to explain the project's findings in an accessible format. This will be made available on-line with clips incorporated into our exhibitions at institutions including the Natural History Museum (Tring), Museum of London and Fishbourne Roman Palace. These exhibitions will be connected with the art exhibition (above) to establish 'The Chicken Trail' that, together, will explain the natural/cultural history of the chicken. A tourist guide to The Chicken Trail will be available for free download via the Coop website and those of our collaborating institutions. The Chicken Trail will be launched in January 2017 to coincide with the Chinese 'Year of the Rooster'.

2) Schoolchildren. From the start, we will work with educational artist, Ben Frimet, to deliver cross-curricular activities to schools/academies nationwide. Using chickens as the focus, pupils will be taught (art) history, archaeology, environmental ethics and scientific techniques. The project's results will be used as the focus for the pupil's creative writing (re-imagining the life-history of their animals) and artwork. Artistic outputs will be uploaded to the Coop website and will form the foundation of physical art exhibitions installed within the institutions involved in the project but also in public spaces (e.g. butchers' shops and laundrettes) within inner-city London: Frimet has successfully pioneered similar exhibitions.

3) Chicken Breeders/Keepers. Today, chickens are a serious economic, environmental and ethical concern. The impact of their management is hotly debated: at the large-scale, intensive farming has been widely critiqued (e.g. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's 'Chicken Out' campaign) whereas small-scale domestic husbandry has been equally lambasted for spreading disease (The Guardian 23/05/12). Our project will provide both a philosophical review and deep-time empirical evidence to inform on these current debates. Throughout the project we will communicate our results to the world of poultry breeders via our partnership with Practical Poultry (membership 17,000) and through publication in their dedicated magazine. We will work directly with members, briefing them on the significance of chickens and providing information on the origin and genetic diversity of rare breed populations - issues key to the development of effective management strategies. Members will be asked to provide samples for analysis and encouraged to volunteer for anthropological interviews so that they might engage directly in our research.

4) Academic community. We have established Chicken Coop, an international and trans-disciplinary research hub to foster dialogue, increase knowledge transfer and facilitate collaboration between academics worldwide. All of the individuals specified on the website, and many more besides, will benefit directly from this project. It will also be a platform where discussions about chickens can be shared with the other groups. The on-line database will form a vital research platform for scholars globally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1576505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Practical Poultry Magazine</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Practical Poultry Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6D08D85-628F-4796-B22C-0AA52C8F9787</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Articles in Practical Poultry magazine</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544612297296f8.95853614-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to readership to supply information about modern chicken keeping; participation in the Being Human Festival event at Vindolanda, November 2014</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of a series of short articles to the magazine on the history of chicken keeping; advertising magazine at Glastonbury Festival, Being Human Festival and other outreach events</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Henpower</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Henpower</gtr:description><gtr:id>E60A692A-CB7A-4A7D-A3F7-78C6AD98E74F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54461454eeb112.25569248-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Participation in the Being Human Festival event, Vindolanda November 2014;</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Providing publicity for the work of HenPower via our collaboration at events such as Being Human Festival</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Roman Archaeology Conference Rome 2016 (M Maltby)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FACF97B3-5B8C-4F56-A64A-417A2C8638E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the Roman Archaeology Conference, Rome March 2016 entitled &amp;quot;Multidisciplinary Approaches to Human-Chicken Interactions: Contextualising Britain in the Wider Roman World&amp;quot; presented by M Maltby on behalf of the Human and Chickens Interaction Team.

Visitor interaction time lasted on average between five and ten minutes, although some people stayed for far longer and others returned multiple times. Activities included interactive mapping, skeletal material to examine, archaeological finds for handling and information to explore.

The activities and discussions were very well received and the interest expressed by the visitors was gratifyingly universal. The audience was exceptionally diverse and as such presented the opportunity to engage with participants from a wide range of backgrounds and viewpoints. Resultantly people were interested for a variety of reasons; from vegan caterers and backyard breeders to sustainable food trust workers and chicken vaccinators. The participants relished the opportunity to handle material and draw their own conclusions from the data and were confident in asking questions and engaging in complex debate. Time and time again the participants would express that they had not realised or considered that archaeology and anthropology could integrate so thoroughly with scientific research. Work such as this is essential for allowing us to learn about our public audience and what we can give to them through our work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54574d16f279f6.97373580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciculture.ac.uk/2014/07/17/rise-with-the-crow-ahrc-public-engagement-at-glastonbury-festival/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Animals Conference, University of Chichester (Maltby M)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E400246-CBC1-46AD-9DEE-728C400307B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper entitled Why did Chickens cross the Globe? was presented by Mark Maltby at the Animals! Understanding Human Culture through the Ubiquitous Others Conference, hosted by the Sussex Archaeological Society and held at the University of Chichester on Sep 6 2014. The audience was comprised of, members of local archaeological societies, other members of the public, plus archaeological practitioners and students. Information about the aims, objectives and scope of the Humans and Chickens Project was presented. The presentation stimulated discussion and questions during the session and subsequently.

Several people from the conference came to see us at an exhibition of our project at Fishbourne Museum the following day, where they engaged in our interactive displays and we discussed with them our research in more detail. Data has subsequently been provided by several members of the audience for the Humans and Chickens Project's zooarchaeological database together with several photographs and other information about archaeological artefacts displaying chicken images.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542e7379c14e76.92171447</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://scicultchickens.org/blog/something-fishy-team-visits-fishbourne-roman-palace</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>YorNight: European Researcher's Night (E.

The presentation was followed by the opportunity for the audience to handle skeletal material and discuss archaeological finds.

After the talk several of the participants enjoyed using the bone material to discuss the changes that have developed in chickens reared intensively for meat and eggs, the identification of sex, and indicators of health. Those who kept chickens joined an interesting discussion about behaviour, egg-laying productivity and domestic chickens' differences from the wild junglefowl ancestors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545753144b3330.92732399</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://research.bournemouth.ac.uk/engagement/chicken-coop-a-potted-history-of-chickens/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Proposal for The Times Cheltenham Science Festival, London (H.

Dinnersaurus rex was made by City of London Academy pupils, under the direction of artist Ben Frimet. It is a memorial to the chicken's descent - both from its dinosaur origins and in terms of its fall into mass exploitation. Information about the project was provided by the exhibit and several members of the team displayed other aspect's of the project's work on that day.

Our innovative research includes developments in the methods associated with the studies of lipid residues in ceramics, DNA and isotopic analyses of chicken bones and feathers, and the metrical analysis of their bones. We are investigating the ecology of chickens and mapping their dispersal across Europe, and have devised and applied novel integrative analysis of eggshells from archaeological sites. We are also studying material culture associated with chickens in Roman Britain and Gaul, and have produced new insights into the history and nature of pathology in chicken bones. The development of a detailed database of chicken bones from archaeological sites is enabling us to undertake a comprehensive review of the spread and abundance of chickens across Europe from the late prehistoric period onwards. Our anthropological research is providing new insights into contemporary chicken-keeping and exploitation in Britain, continental Europe, North Africa and the Canary Isles. We are combining various facets of this research into co-authored papers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The developments in scientific analysis will be of value in future research in these specialist fields. The results from various periods and regions will be helpful for a wide range of archaeologists interested in animal exploitation, diet, material culture and ritual. The results will also demonstrate how scientific and cultural approaches can be integrated effectively. A deeper understanding of the history of animal-human relationships will also furnish information for modern day debates about the exploitation of animals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FE1A357E-EB04-413F-A6D0-60FE51E42472</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dff70f56cf52.88198910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database to capture data on chicken bones from archaeological sites and modern reference collections across Europe</gtr:description><gtr:id>69BB50C6-66BA-4538-81A6-048FF39A926A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work in progress.
