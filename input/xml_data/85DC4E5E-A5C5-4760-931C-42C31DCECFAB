Thus, it is important to understand the impact of public sector funding and policy initiatives on the creation of new businesses and the growth of existing small firms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will examine this issue from both 'supply' and 'demand' perspectives. First, the aim is to focus on the nature of regional policy initiatives which provide support and brokerage services to encourage entrepreneurship and promote growth in established small firms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second, the research will explore the challenges and difficulties that entrepreneurs face in accessing resources from regional policy and funding initiatives.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Third, the research will have an international comparative focus with case studies from the UK and continental Europe so as to critically evaluate the ways in which regional policy is effective (or not) in promoting entrepreneurship and small firm growth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be employed, including critical discourse analysis of relevant academic and policy documents, analysis of secondary quantitative data and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders in the respective case studies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The focus of this research is on the small firm sector which is considered to be the bedrock of the European economy and a key driver of growth, jobs and innovation. How to encourage the growth of small firms and enhance entrepreneurship in order to promote economic development, especially in Europe, has become one of the main questions for both policy makers and academics in recent years. This has led to a new policy paradigm in which there is increased focus on public support to assist small firms and a range of measures have been introduced including skilled brokers providing advice on a range of issues, including access to finance and technology; networking; developing new markets etc. Providing the right mix of funding and support for small firms is, however, far from easy and it is apparent that the success of such initiatives has been mixed, especially in less developed regions and more socially deprived localities across Europe. This research, therefore, aims to understand better the dynamics and linkages between the range of public sector funding and policy initiatives to encourage entrepreneurship and small firms in the UK and elsewhere in the EU. 

The inter-disciplinary and comparative nature of the research means that the findings will be of interest to range of beneficiaries in the UK and the EU. First, it will be relevant to policy makers, practitioners and politicians from the local, regional, national and European levels who want to explore ways to refine the policy process and improve the ways in which support is delivered and implemented. Secondly, the findings will also be relevant to entrepreneurs and small firm owner-managers who have benefitted (or not) from public sector support schemes; this dimension is important in order to try to tailor better the initiatives to meet the actual needs of entrepreneurs (especially graduates). Thirdly, a range of intermediary organisations that provide services to entrepreneurs and small firms will be interested in the findings including venture capitalists, brokers, consultancy companies and business associations. This group of actors performs a key role in linking public sector support to the small firm and entrepreneurial communities. 

Beneficiaries will be targeted in a number of ways. First, the Fellow has professional experience as a practitioner and understands clearly how to provide useful and relevant material for a range of stakeholders. Thus, along with academic publications, a range of outputs will be produced containing the key messages from the research, in accessible plain English targeted at policy makers and other beneficiaries. Second, the findings will be disseminated through presentations at a number of practitioner-led conferences and events, the aim being to obtain feedback to inform further aspects of the research. Third, a key element of the research is to bring together some of the key actors in the respective case study regions to facilitate an exchange of good practice in the field; this will be done with the assistance of colleagues in the Management School in order to help to organise effective user engagement. 

Maximising the involvement of a range of beneficiaries in the research is a key priority in order to increase the policy relevance and impact of the findings. The Fellow will build upon the capacity and expertise of the Management School at Liverpool in order to access the wide-range of existing networks and contacts that colleagues have in order to ensure that the impact of the research can be enhanced.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50304</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Fellowship that I undertook was not a conventional research project as such. The aim of the scheme was to attract candidates with PhDs in another discipline other than Business and Management and/or professional experience outisde of academia. The attraction of the scheme for me was the fact that I had both. 

In this regard, my ESRC Fellowship experience was invaluable because it allowed me to transition back into academia. It must be be said that for this opportunity I am extremely grateful. Moreover, the findings from the Fellowship allowed me to gain a full time tenured position in the Management School at the University of Liverpool. This was an excellent outcome for me professionally and should also be viewed as a really positive impact of the research funding. 

More specifically, the findings from the research have been used to produce several academic conference papers including British Academy of Management (BAM) (in 2013 and 2014) and Institute of Small Business and Entrepreneurship (2013 and 2014). These conferences provided useful fora for my research findings to be discussed in order to gain useful feedback to improve my research. 

I also developed a range of working papers and journal article submissions during my Fellowship. This has led to the publication of two 3* rated publications, according to the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list. The impact of these publications was primarily to help me to secure my tenured position in Liverpool. 

Another impact of my research was the successful submission of an ESRC PhD CASE Studentship, jointly with Unilever PLC . The aim of this doctoral research is to build on my Fellowship research to explore the development of a nascent innovation ecosystem in the Liverpool city-region. This led to the appointment of a PhD student for whom I am the primary supervisor. This is my first PhD supervision, which was clearly an important milestone for me. 

The research, which I am supervising, is advancing well and several academic conference papers have been developed. Moreover, another impact of the research has been the development of closer links to Unilever, particularly their Global Innovation team, which is based at Port Sunlight in the Liverpool city-region. These links will continue to produce a range of interesting research and related opportunities.

In summary, the ESRC Fellowship provided me with an invaluable opportunity that allowed me to return to academia after a 9 year gap. As mentioned, without this opportunity, this would have been impossible. Instead, I now have a tenured position in a Russell Group University and I am able to develop my research interests further.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6A4CF9F0-29A9-42D3-A607-6BD2AFCD94EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cea4e926092.06813926</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has generated several key findings. First, that public policy and funding is crucial to encouraging new firms to start and grow. Second, that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' to providing business support. Third, more work needs to be done to explore the links between policy, the creation of small firms and economic development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ESRC funding contributed to the Fellowship that I was employed on in the Management School at the University of Liverpool. Importantly, I gained a full time Lectureship at the University following the completion of the project, which will allow me to take forward the research findings through a couple of projects that have emerged from the funded research. These build on the work already undertaken and In addition, a range of stakeholders will be interested in the publications that emerge from the research project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DA0E69B-144B-4643-B75E-9B62826BB27D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cec0b67b0e4.34508408</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K002538/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
