(CLOSER)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K000357/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The UK has a portfolio of the longest-running longitudinal studies in the world. These studies are well-recognised as one of the most crucial sources of evidence for policy development in health, economics and society.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are a number of different academic institutions running longitudinal studies in the UK. The CLOSER network brings these teams together to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>stimulate interdisciplinary research across the major longitudinal studies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>provide shared resources for research&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>assist with training and development for researchers in the use of longitudinal data at all career stages&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>share information and expertise in longitudinal methodology.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>By doing this, CLOSER will help to build the body of knowledge on how UK people and society are changing across the generations, and how life in the UK compares to life in other countries. CLOSER will help increase the number of researchers who are confident and able to analyse longitudinal data. And last but not least, CLOSER will help improve the quality of the datasets themselves, making sure that data are comparable across studies and that the teams leading the studies can share best practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The CRF will have a vital role in maximizing the impact of the UK's world-leading portfolio of longitudinal studies. Five specific audiences will be targeted, all of whom will benefit in distinct ways: (1) researchers; (2) policy makers; (3) practitioners; (4) the public; and, (5) study members. 
Researchers divide into five groups: 1) Early career researchers, with little experience of conducting longitudinal analysis, will benefit from dedicated training packages, accessible and integrated information on the key longitudinal studies, and from the increased availability of linked data. 2) Researchers with previous experience of longitudinal analysis will benefit from tailored training, and the availability of harmonised variables. The latter will promote wider use of data and cross-cohort analysis. 3) Researchers from central and local government, who commission, undertake and use research, will benefit from the creation of a single information hub about the portfolio of studies, and the identification of the range of cohort data relevant to specific policy issues. 4) Researchers from overseas will benefit from the same single information hub and from detailed documentation on harmonised variables. 5) Teams managing cohort studies will benefit from knowledge exchange workshops on issues relating to study management. The benefits of the CRF for researchers will begin to be realised within the first five years of funding; thereafter, given the long-term value of the resources created, and the time taken for researchers to gain experience in longitudinal analysis, benefits will grow incrementally over the next decade and beyond. 
Policy makers will benefit from the coordinated work of the CRF leadership team to ensure that existing findings from analysis of cohort studies have instrumental impact. A series of briefings will be organised to highlight and distil the principal policy-relevant findings from across the studies on such themes as: social mobility; the 'Big Society'; health and well-being; family life; healthy ageing; housing, and residential mobility. To enhance understanding of the instrumental impact of cohort research, the briefings will include input from practitioners and/or policy makers, discussing how the findings inform their work. The impact of the briefings will be evaluated to assess impact, with benefits realised within the lifetime of the CRF.
Practitioners (in the third and private sectors as well as government) are unlikely to conduct their own analyses using the cohort studies. However their decision making and professional practice will be informed by evidence from the cohort studies. Members of the leadership team will identify key knowledge exchange opportunities such as professional and thematic conferences and events. Given the time taken for research results to be translated into policy, or adopted by practitioner groups, it is expected that the benefits of the CRF to practitioners will be observed over a longer term than the benefits to groups of researchers described above.
The CRF will have a less direct impact on the public but will work to enhance the public understanding of the value of longitudinal research. Additionally, by encouraging nterdisciplinary research that addresses questions of direct policy relevance, and maximising the impact of the studies, it is expected that in due course the CRF will play a role in increasing the effectiveness of public services, and enhancing health and well-being.
The CRF will provide a mechanism for sharing best practice in involving study members (and their families) in the design and development of cohort studies, as well as the processes for feeding back results from individual studies. The aim will be to increase the quantity and quality of information provided to study members about the value of longitudinal studies, improve their engagement with the study and minimise attrition. Benefits will be realised within the lifetime of the CRF.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7008240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Michigan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>DDI Technical Committee</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB5FF9C0-F355-47AF-86B9-A5942A5B1982</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Amendments to the DDI-L specification have added functionality in the capture and subsequent display of metadata elements for enhanced rendering of survey questions</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55dee8df5b4194.90518059-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Technical expertise and advice, changes to the DDI-L to meet requirements of the CLOSER Search platform</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Weekly meetings of the Technical Committee which oversees the maintenance and development of the Data Documentation Initiative standard</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Harmonised Dataset Committee</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE043945-3F3C-405D-82EA-96EB05337A52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The working group have produced a guidance document called the 'data dissemination strategy', which offers a framework for the dissemination of harmonised datasets from CLOSER work packages.

Some comments from delegates included:
-Bringing people together to share their experiences ... which helped to highlight the diverse nature of longitudinal studies and the different challenges they face 
-It was interesting to see the wide range of cohort studies from across the UK and other countries. Hearing from other studies (not just longitudinal studies) allowed you to think a little bit differently about how you engaged your participants.

Session Information:
This session invited presentations dealing with structured metadata in a standardized form across the survey life-cycle: models, systems and tools for i.e. instrument design, data entry, data processing, maintaining data documentation, and capturing and storing the metadata within a repository for later reuse. There is increased interest in supporting the comparison and harmonization of studies/waves over space and time, and across studies, especially at the level of theoretical concepts, questions, and variables to which structured metadata is well suited.

Capturing metadata as early on in the survey life-cycle as possible in a structured way enhances transparency and quality, enables reproducible research and reuse of survey components for other waves or surveys.

A wide range of different products and services for different users can be generated on the basis of computer-processable metadata like web-based information systems, traditional codebooks, command setups for statistical packages, question banks, and searching and locating of data which assist in the use or interpretation of the data.

Papers were invited on, but not limited to, the following topics: reuse of metadata across space, time, and studies, metadata banks such as for questions and classifications, metadata-driven processes, and metadata-driven information systems, possibly using the major specification for social science metadata, DDI Lifecycle (DDI 3 branch of the Data Documentation Initiative).

The session was aimed at survey designers and implementers, data and metadata managers, information system managers of cross-national surveys, metadata experts, and others.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>581316469d49c2.83967766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/event/rc33-conference-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lessons Learnt From the Development of a DDI-Based Discovery Platform</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>14A78736-D682-4887-81F8-8876759A7FB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation at the European DDI Conference</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a4240ee75dc2.10976907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eddi-conferences.eu/ocs/index.php/eddi/eddi16/paper/view/240</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding family life, work life balance and the care of children: a symposium on cross-national</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D90BEE53-EF36-4C19-B4D5-93CBF0B94D1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of this event is to bring together researchers with an interest in cross-national research on family life and the care of children.

Work will also continue on fine-tuning the production framework to automate as much as possible in a model-driven environment for the development of the standard. 

There was a focus on incorporating enhanced data citation into the DDI model-based specification. With funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the University of Kansas and the University of Michigan are bringing together experts in data citation who will use the week at Dagstuhl to model data citation across the research data life cycle. Representatives from other metadata standards collaborated with DDI modelers in adding comprehensive citation support to the DDI model. A taxonomy for the role of contributor to a dataset was also developed. This work will provide a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization of the different metadata standards. 
Deliverables from the workshop included drafts of the model and its documentation, which will be made available for public review, and mappings to other standards. The workshop also produced a set of best practices for citing data at all levels and providing attribution to all dataset contributors. These best practices could be applied to other metadata standards in other disciplines.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b386cc312184.32956076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.dagstuhl.de/14432</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: Working with biological samples in cohort studies</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>543B9A3E-D3D4-4FDA-8834-2F2B87359DC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Biological samples such as blood, urine and saliva are collected routinely by many cohort studies.

The civil servants we spoke to said they learned a great deal more about the studies, and one agreed to take part in alpha testing for CLOSER Discovery.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b0b0234b9b90.78077854</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.civilservicelive.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CLOSER Longitudinal Methodology Series I</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E3A6278-F50C-4544-AD4B-94C3EB7970D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>29/1/2015 - the inaugural seminar in the CLOSER Longitudinal Methodology Series inaugural event featured talks from Dr George Ploubidis, Reader in Population Health and Statistics and Chief Statistician at the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (who focused on biomarkers in mid-life), and Professor Fiona Steele, Professor in Statistics at The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) (who focused on estimating push and pull effects of area characteristics on residential location choice using household panel data).

This session aimed to explore the key issues and challenges faced when linking the two data sets.

How do the characteristics of our local neighbourhoods effect our socioeconomic chances, health and wellbeing over the course of our lives? Answers to these questions can be found by linking geographical data - such as levels of local air pollution, quantity of green space, and crime rates - to survey data collected by longitudinal studies. This workshop covered how data users can use linked geographical data in longitudinal studies to explore innovative new avenues for research.

Dr David Bann

Using longitudinal studies to examine changes in health inequality: cross-cohort differences in body mass index inequality
In order to understand and ultimately reduce health inequalities, high-quality evidence is required to quantify how they have changed across time-both as individuals age and comparing different generations. However, there are numerous challenges of such analyses, including potentially problematic differences in measurement, sampling, and missing data, and considering how to quantify socioeconomic inequality. We present work investigating how socioeconomic inequalities in body mass index (BMI) have changed across adulthood, using data from three national British birth cohort studies (initiated in 1946, 1958, and 1970), and discuss the challenges encountered which likely apply to other studies of health inequality.

Dr Leah Li

Changes in the association of life-course Body Mass Index trajectories with adult blood pressure across two British birth cohorts
Recent increases in the prevalence of obesity and more rapid gains in Body Mass Index (BMI) have been observed for all life stages. The impact of secular changes in lifetime BMI trajectories on cardiovascular disease risk factors is little studied. This talk is based on our work using the 1946 and 1958 British birth cohorts. We investigated associations between life-course BMI trajectories and adult blood pressure (BP) levels across two generations. BP did not increase despite higher levels of adult BMI in the younger cohort. A stronger association was found between BMI trajectory and BP in mid-adulthood in the younger cohort. We will discuss the possible explanations for the strengthening BMI/BP association, and the implications in the context of the obesity epidemic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5874b43303a7f4.97978627</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/news-opinion/2016/latest-videos-longitudinal-methodology-series-david-bann-and/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Recent developments in survey metadata capture, discovery and harmonisation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D872715-2EF3-4D7D-8D83-DF1EFCB29DFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion on how other similar organisations could use our experience to improve data and metadata management in other large scale studies

Cross-national comparative survey offer a range of analytical benefits for understanding both institutional differences between countries and their impacts and truly cross-national phenomena, such as the recent increase of intra-EU migration with the expansion of the EU. Yet they are not straightforward to implement, due to differences in sampling frames and in approaches to data collection, as well as the difficulties in constructing a questionnaire that suits different national contexts. These challenges are exacerbated when attempting to survey specific and compare the responses of specific groups, such as migrants. This paper presents the implementation of a short panel survey of recently arrived migrants in four European countries. It discusses the specific challenges to harmonised data collection and how (and the extent to which) these were resolved.

Young Lives: An extensive longitudinal study into children &amp;amp; youth around the world. Methodological challenges, strengths and weaknesses
Young Lives is an longitudinal study of childhood poverty following the lives of two cohorts of children - an Older Cohort born in 1994-95 and a Younger Cohort born in 2001-02 - in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam over 15 years. The first survey took place in 2002, with three further rounds of data collection in 2006-07, 2009-10 and 2013-14. The fifth round of data collection is currently in the field.

Young Lives is a unique longitudinal cross-country study that focuses on low and middle income countries. Although the benefits of longitudinal cohort studies is well established, the process of designing and implementing the questionnaire, and the challenges attached to it, are different from those faced by longitudinal studies in developed countries. The objectives of this presentation is to briefly document this process and reflect on the different limitations and challenges in a developing countries context. Young Lives is a living example of how these challenges have been addressed over the past five rounds of data.

The event was fully booked with 30 researchers from various career stages. We recorded the two presenations and they are available on the project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5813151b38de72.30017122</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/news-opinion/2016/latest-videos-longitudinal-methodology-series-viii/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog: Where the evidence fits: How research findings are used in the policymaking process</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E95BD3B8-E9A9-41F5-9AD1-284BF52563E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meghan Rainsberry, CLOSER Communications Manager, examined research impact and how research findings effect government policies.

Building on these discussions, the workshop identified what further research is required in relation to both the design and analysis of mixed mode data collection.

The workshop was attended by 27 delegates. It received an average satisfaction rate of 9.2 and an average relevance rate of 8.8 from the evaluation forms.

The EDDI conference took place in Cologne, Germany between 6 and 7 December 2016.

About the conference

EDDI is focused on developing a standard for documenting metadata in a consistent and reusable format. This year's conference discussed the current usage and implementation of DDI. Presentations covered a wide range of topics including; early and mature implementations, the interplay of DDI with other standards and technologies and critiques of DDI.

Lessons learnt from the development of a DDI-based discovery platform
CLOSER's technical lead, Jon Johnson, presented CLOSER Discovery to EDDI for the first time. In addition to giving a basic introduction to the project, he also discussed a number of the advanced features that CLOSER Discovery has made available.

Lessons from a large-scale metadata archiving team using DDI-lifecycle
CLOSER's Metadata Officer, Hayley Mills presented the lessons CLOSER has learnt about managing large-scale metadata ingest. Hayley offered a number of 'top tips' acquired from her own experiences, which cover expected cost and time commitments, advised styles of verification and validation, and the type of personalities working with metadata requires.

Archivist and Mapper: Simplifying and modernising questionnaire entry
CLOSER's Technical Manager, Will Poynter introduced Archivist and Mapper - two bespoke tools, created by CLOSER, which support the large-scale management of metadata. Both tools are open-source and are available to view. Will also demonstrated Archivist to interested delegates during the poster session.

In addition, CLOSER presented a poster on principles to effective metadata entry, which have been recently updated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5874b4d686dcc2.44886267</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/event/8th-annual-european-ddi-user-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: Review of methods for determining pubertal status</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83A5A94A-5A46-4B17-87FA-A10710287174</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Puberty has a significant impact on both mental and physical health, and therefore cross-sectional and cohort studies are increasingly interested in assessment of pubertal status.

The MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit in Southampton is hosting a workshop, funded by CLOSER and the Society for Social Medicine to present their initial findings, generate discussion and learn from the expertise and experiences of the workshop delegates. The day will consist of four short talks from experts, with plenty of time for discussion and a 'snowballing' activity to gain consensus and represent the range of views at the workshop.

Guests scored it a 9/10 for satisfaction.

The audience asked excellent questions and the talks generated great discussions at the event and on twitter. The event was captured on video and made available on the CLOSER website.

Some comments from attendees:

&amp;quot;Science events can be too dry but this was the exact opposite, probably due to the mix of scientific and non-scientific panel members.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The insights from the study participant and the 7Up participant really brought the subject alive. The visual aids were also very interesting, particularly the photographic composition used by Prof. Alison Park. All speakers were very engaging!&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The event was very well run. The introduction at the start was very easy to understand and the graphics were very nice. The example of the photo cohort was a nice feature as well. As someone who knows abit about cohort studies anyway the most interesting bit of the event for me was hearing from the 2 different study members themselves. It was nice to hear the personal stories to be able to put the work that I do into some context.&amp;quot;

Over 180 people registered for the event from a wide array of backgrounds - the general public, the third sector, academics. The event has received excellent feedback.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5645dc4784dcb2.96251510</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/event/from-7-up-to-social-science/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alison Park: shedding light on life outcomes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E852490C-0EBD-4E92-8448-0980BA24A1D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alison Park, Director of CLOSER, was some questions about the project and that's been made available on the ESRC website.

The prevention of non-response in longitudinal surveys: an overview of the literature and some ideas for future research

This presentation is about the prevention of unit non-response in longitudinal surveys through improving survey practice. I will give a brief overview of the relevant theoretical and empirical literature on non-response in longitudinal surveys covering all of the main sources of non-response i.e. location, contact and co-operation and focusing primarily on evidence from major face-to-face longitudinal surveys in the UK. Recent developments such as the use of para-data, adaptive or response designs and targeted response inducement strategies will be discussed. I will highlight some gaps in our knowledge and suggest some ideas for future research and practice.

The impact of attrition and non-response in birth cohort studies: a need to incorporate missingness strategies

This paper reveals the need to incorporate strategies to handle missing data by revealing the extent of attrition in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study (BCS70) and how it affects sample composition over time. To begin with we illustrate the construction of inverse probability weights (IPWs) to adjust for the unit non-response. Secondly, we illustrate the impact of using IPWs and multiple imputation (MI) for an artificially constructed set of patterns of missingness for a substantive research question. Our findings show that when the predictive power of the response models is weak, the efficacy of using IPWs is undermined. Further, MI is effective in reducing the bias resulting from item missingness when the magnitude of the bias is high and the imputation models are well specified.

We recorded the two presenations and they are available on the project website.

About
In March 1946, as the country reeled in the aftermath of World War II, British scientists set out on an extraordinary mission - to interview the parents of all babies born in a single week. Little did they know that they would continue to follow those babies throughout their entire lives, inspiring a 70-year tradition of tracking generations of British people from birth to death.

The UK's longitudinal studies have collected information on every aspect of their participants' lives - from their family, to education and employment, health and how they age. The studies have been credited with discoveries ranging from the negative effects of smoking during pregnancy, to the effect of poverty on child development.

The walk was led by experienced Blue Badge Guide Kim Dewdney and covered the Bloomsbury area, highlighting the history and findings of the UK's longitudinal studies, stories from the lives of the people involved, and how these remarkable studies have shaped and been shaped by modern British history.

The event received excellent feedback with 24 people registering for the walk. Due to the success of the walking tour it is planned to be repeated again.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5874b13240ff40.21222250</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/event/extraordinary-ordinary-britain-walking-tour/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Documenting harmonisation and question provenance using DDI</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71B44FC4-B721-40F6-A63D-43AA32A4CFBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk raised questions on the possibility of ONS / UK Data Service collaboration on improving ONS harmonised question availability and discovery and possibilities of integrating DDI into outputs from the Electronic Data Capture

CLOSER hosted a symposium that looks at the harmonisation and comparison of measures of body mass index, physiological and physical function, and wellbeing across different longitudinal studies. The symposium reported on three CLOSER-funded harmonisation and comparative projects involving a number of different UK cohort studies. The first two papers examined the relationship between childhood and adult socioeconomic position (which have themselves also required harmonisation) and body mass index (Paper 1) and adult mental wellbeing (Paper 2). In each case, the paper explored whether and how this relationship varies between cohorts.

The workshop defined the scope, structure, and documentation.

One was led by Andy Boyd from ALSPAC and looked at the challenges and value of data linkage. This session included talks from researchers working on CLOSER Work Packages 5 and 7; Gundi Knies (WP7) talked about understanding the mechanisms of consenting to data linkage and BIlal Nasim (WP5) presented work on linking cohort studies in CLOSER to the National Pupil Database. The second symposium, led by Alison Park, looked at the differing approaches to participant engagement from a number of cohort and longitudinal studies. Growing Up in New Zealand's approach was presented by Susan Morton who shared insights into how the study has taken steps to ensure their sample is representative by engaging with the indigenous population. Lynn Molloy gave an overview of ALSPAC's participant engagement approach, including the role of Participant Advisory Panel in the study. Lisa Calderwood spoke about the efforts made to keep the Millennium Cohort Study participants engaged through their teenage years - a critical point for attrition. 

We also had an exhibition stand at the conference advertising CLOSER and our products.

The symposia were well received and the conference provided an excellent opportunity to promote CLOSER's work. The conference was attended by over 300 delegates and all three symposia were well attended.

Therefore it is important that DDI is developed carefully and in alignment with best practices in metadata development. The DDI metadata standard should not exist in isolation but should participate with other standards in a larger framework characterized by interoperability and collaboration. To realize these goals, this year's workshop will bring together representatives from other metadata standards to provide an external review of current DDI work, with an emphasis on the model-driven approach, the production framework, and the substantive content of the standard. Progress made so far will be examined in light of the high-level goals and design principles for the model-driven specification.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b3879412f760.49981839</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.dagstuhl.de/15433</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk about CLOSER harmonisation work at HM Treasury Mini-Conference about social mobility</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8064C82-9AC2-4A67-8C6E-6A46582E7BFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Claire Crawford invited to speak about her CLOSER funded work on mobility at this event, aimed at social researchers and economists in Westminister and organised by the Government Economic and Social Research Team.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b41438082ca0.27186822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>About CLOSER</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C859F7EC-0FC9-4438-A446-057B86428983</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk about CLOSER for staff and students at LSE's Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion 23 November 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03dc75753a4.13599735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Social Justice Expert Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>262DE64D-9A21-4C7A-BB56-33E4816F5897</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rob Davies, CLOSER Public Affairs Manager, attended a workshop to challenge and refine DWP analysis and conclusions on social justice.

Missing data handling in longitudinal studies: Evidence for the 1958 British birth cohort.
Selection bias, in the form of incomplete or missing data, is unavoidable in longitudinal surveys. It results in smaller samples, incomplete histories, lower statistical power and it is well known that unbiased estimates cannot be obtained without properly addressing the implications of incompleteness. However, statistical methods exist which enable users to exploit the full richness of longitudinal data and address sources of bias. We present the first results from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies Missing Data Strategy using data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) which follows the lives of 17,416 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958. Also known as the 1958 Birth Cohort Study, it collects information on physical and educational development, economic circumstances, employment, family life, health behaviour, wellbeing, social participation and attitudes. Since the birth survey in 1958, there have been ten further 'sweeps' of all cohort members at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 44, 46, 50 and 55. Within Rubin's framework we present three papers where we clarify the situations where complete case analysis and methods that operate under the Missing At Random assumption return unbiased results. We present a three step empirical/data driven approach that maximises the plausibility of the Missing At Random assumption in NCDS and quantify the effect of strong departures from MAR. Our findings have implications for missing data handling in the 1958 cohort and other longitudinal studies as they will help inform the selection of auxiliary variables and allow researchers to effectively communicate the assumptions underlying popular MAR methods such as Multiple Imputation, Full Information Maximum Likelihood and Inverse Probability Weighting.

The event was fully booked with 30 delegates. We recorded the two presentations and they are available on the project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>581317df6428b7.26717234</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/news-opinion/2016/latest-videos-longitudinal-methodology-series-centre/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Have &quot;Questions&quot;?
