The Time Capsule was used to capture 11 stories of impact from a range of academic staff across engineering and physical sciences. Each story comprises a physical object relevant to the academic's research and a video of them telling the story - including their hopes and dreams for how the full impact will one day be realized. The video stories were captured by Brady Haran - a long time collaborator with the University of Nottingham. The Time Capsule tours the University - being placed in public spaces for passing traffic to view and explore.</gtr:description><gtr:id>14B97A1F-FD85-42D8-9E40-0823E44A4951</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The series of 11 YouTube videos published on this project have had combined views of more than 223,000 (to November 2014, 266,000 to March 2016 with no additional marketing).
