(Resubmission)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J003816/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This is a collaborative research and dissemination project on the welfare and public health history of Belfast and its hinterland, informed by three interlinked and co-ordinated case studies focusing on specific dimensions of that history. These elements are:
1. Welfare and Public Health in Belfast and the North of Ireland 1800-1973
The keystone element of the project combines all four project researchers, with institutional and external collaborators, in producing shared research and impact-related outputs on the history of poverty, welfare and public health in Belfast and its hinterland over the period between the Act of Union and the restructuring of public health administration in 1973 following the termination of majoritarian devolved government in Northern Ireland. The PI and two RAs will produce a number of collaborative research articles and jointly edit a collection of essays drawn from a summative conference. Collaborators drawn from four other universities and Social Policy at Queen's will be actively involved in workshops and the conference. Impact activities include a project website, exhibition, public workshops and a projected television documentary.
2. 'Whited Sepulchres? Poor relief, public health and the decline of the civic ideal: Belfast c. 1840-1939': Dr. Olwen Purdue (RA1)
This sub-project will examine the contradiction between Belfast's public face of civic pride and municipal improvement and the reality of poverty, disease and death that stalked its streets throughout much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the problems associated with poverty and disease and the effectiveness of public and private responses to these in a city at once characterised by deep cultural and political divisions. This study focuses principally on the Belfast Poor Law Union (established 1840) and its relationship with civic authorities, the state and local government.
3. 'Poverty and public health in Belfast and its hinterland 1898-1973': Dr. Peter Martin (RA2)
This sub-project will study the relationship between public health and poverty 1898-1973. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 consolidated the organisation of public health in Belfast. The reformed urban authority had to cope with several problems, particularly in sanitation and housing. When Northern Ireland was established in 1920, it inherited a relatively poor standard of public health and a delicate political balance between Belfast Corporation and the devolved provincial government. This project will examine the 'step by step' agenda of Stormont policy and the reluctant embrace of the welfare state by Belfast policymakers after 1945. A significant reform of public health in 1973 marks the end of the study. Public health policy emerged through many layers including the devolved government of Northern Ireland and the civic and other local government bodies of the Belfast region and was influenced by a variety of stakeholders including religious leaders, medical professionals and employers. The study considers Northern Ireland as the first devolved 'welfare periphery' within the UK, and uses the Belfast region as a case study locus in implementation of policy and patient experience.
4. 'Poverty, poor relief and public health in Belfast and its region 1800-1851': Ph.D. supervised by Prof. P. Gray.
This project will build on Gray's work on the origins of the Irish Poor Law to investigate the specific structures and dynamics of poverty in the north-east of Ireland in the decades between the Union, the Famine, and the Medical Charities Act of 1851. It will focus on the developing town of Belfast, the 'linen triangle' to its south-west and the rural hinterlands of counties Antrim, Down and Armagh. It will evaluate voluntary poor and medical relief structures and the debate on a poor law, and consider the distinctiveness of NE Ulster as a welfare region of both Ireland and the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?
The principal non-academic beneficiaries will be the public of Belfast and its hinterland in Northern Ireland. The historical experience of welfare and public health has touched virtually every family in the city, and we anticipate significant levels of local public interest in our research outputs. The project addresses a central element of the social history of the city and offers an alternative to the hegemonic sectarian narrative of the city's history. 
Specific audiences include:
Civil society bodies such as local history societies and genealogical groups 
Schools, particularly 6th-form history students
Northern Ireland's print and broadcast media
Local charities and relief organisations, such as the Simon Community, Shelter, and the DePaul Trust

How will they benefit?
Many of the impact activities related to this research project - public workshops, exhibitions and media production - will allow historical groups, charities and the wider public to explore, in a range of different and easily accessible ways, the social history of their city and communities, with particular focus on the themes of poverty, welfare and public health. Our aim is to employ a range of impact strategies in order to interest members of the public in the social history of the city, to raise public awareness of how this fitted into a wider context of social and political change in Ireland, Britain and Europe and to encourage them to engage in personal research into the historical experience of their family or community, thereby bridging the divide between academic and popular history. 
Students of history in schools will benefit from exhibition and access to articles on the social history of welfare and public health which will be made available on the Irish History Live website, linked to the project website, and from the planned documentary on the social history of welfare and public health in Belfast.

What will be done to ensure they benefit?
In 2013 Belfast will celebrate the 400th anniversary of its founding charter. Working closely with Belfast City Council's heritage officer, Robert Heslip, we plan to integrate our impact activities with the city's commemorations of this milestone, working to locate the history of welfare and public health at the centre of these events. 
Specifically, we will work with Belfast City Council to host a public presentation at the Linen Hall Library, Belfast.
A public exhibition will be organised to represent through artefacts, text and photographic images the social history of welfare and public health in Belfast. This will be hosted by the Ulster Museum in collaboration with National Museums of Northern Ireland staff.
A series of public workshops with local historical societies will be organised, led by the PI and RAs. A further workshop to which representatives of local charities and relief agencies will be invited will explore the implications of our research for contemporary social questions.
We are already working with a television production company with the aim of creating a trailer for a TV documentary on the history of poverty and welfare in 19th-20th century Belfast. If successful, this will be pitched to a regional/national broadcaster (BBCNI, UTV, RTE, etc.) for broadcast in 2013-14.
We will provide press releases to the local press (Belfast Telegraph, Irish News, Belfast Newsletter, Irish Times), and to BBCNI &amp;amp; UTV highlighting aspects of the project and its public significance. This will be timed to coincide with the summative conference in September 2014.
Our project website, hosted by QUB, will offer information on the project, non-academic oriented summaries of research findings, images, and guides to sources and further reading
Short essays on the project's findings will be provided for the schools-oriented website 'Irish History Live' (http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/irishhistorylive/), which is hosted by QUB.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>544832</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Public Record Office of Northern Ireland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PRONI - Surviving the City</gtr:description><gtr:id>62C91A9C-8E7E-4A5A-8ED1-D1AA72FE5130</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition as described above.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd75a699b706.92720905-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Exhibition research and co-curated, and lecture series convened by Dr Olwen Purdue (CI); exhibition launched by Prof Peter Gray (PI), 26 Dec. 2015.

This has been labour-intensive and time-consuming but provides a rich seam of information on the ways in which different groups within society engaged with welfare provision and how that changed over time. 
Belfast's experience of historical poverty and poor relief has been found to have had close parallels to other UK industrial cities, but with areas of variance determined distinct Irish social legislation (and after 1921 devolved legislation passed in Northern Ireland); by the high degree of communal polarisation characteristic of Belfast's demographic development and political history; and by the continuing high level of church-led philanthropy that continued into the 20th century and became strongly associated with communal identities up to and to some extent beyond the Second World War.
Belfast and Northern Ireland's experience of public health provision was found to be shaped by similar pressures up to (and in the case of Catholic health care well beyond) the formation of the NHS, in a devolved context, in the 1940s.
Another rewarding aspect if the project has been the development of a network of scholars working on many aspects of welfare history in Ireland, the UK and beyond, and of archives and organisations relating to the history of welfare in Belfast. This provides an excellent basis for collaborative work in the future, something that is already being explored.

The award objectives were largely met, and will reach final completion with the submission of the project PhD (due Sept. 2016) and submission of manuscripts of the two project monographs - by Dec 2106). Historical understanding of the development of welfare and public health in nineteenth and twentieth-century Belfast has been enhanced and the findings shared with academics and with the general public in a wide range of ways. 
One of the more difficult aspects of the project has been to develop a 'bottom up' approach, one which uncovers the lived experiences of the poor. This is a challenge in any context, but particularly in Ireland where many of the sources that might be available to scholars in other regions do not exist. However, there have been some small successes in finding previously undiscovered collections of letters and other sources which will not only enhance the outputs from this project but will provide a good basis for further research activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate the academic outputs to be used by scholars working the fields of Irish/Ulster history; comparative urban history; comparative welfare and public health history; history of childhood.

Dr Olwen Purdue plans to apply for funding for two new research projects each of which will build on the research carried out in this project. 
The first of these will take the form of an application to the AHRC for follow-on funding in order to develop an outreach project with young people. This will engage young people from different parts of the city in research and dramatic representations relating to the history of poverty and welfare in their area using material and sources uncovered in new and innovative ways.
The second will be a funding application either to RCUK or the ERC for a collaborative project which will explore urban health and welfare in an international comparative context. Building on the work carried out on the history of welfare and public health in Belfast, this will seek to explore the ways in which the health of cities is perceived and protected. Comparisons will be made between the historic context of Belfast and more recent urban experiences in Brazil and India. 

We are optimistic that the public impact of our research will still be enhanced by the commissioning of a full documentary by BBNCI. Our professional standard trailer is complete and will be submitted to BBC in 2016. This has the potential to raise a wide audience. We continue to work with key partners (PRONI, NMNI, Belfast Charitable Society) in impact-related activities to advance public understanding of the research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>695492F9-2378-464D-AADA-ADAD8B7B11E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df47679b9ea3.46447915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
