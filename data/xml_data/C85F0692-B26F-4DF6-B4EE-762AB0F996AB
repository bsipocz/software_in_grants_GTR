Globally around 1 billion people lack access to clean drinking water and water is becoming scarcer in already dry parts of the world. Such drylands (places where rainfall is much less than evaporation) are expanding and now cover more than a third of the Earth's landmass, support a population of around 2 billion people and around half of the world's livestock and cultivated land, and contain globally important ecosystems. Climate change is likely to reduce the amount of rainfall in many drylands by the end of this century and so it is vital that we know how to continue to supply fresh water in these areas, to enable the expanding human population to thrive whilst also keeping dryland ecosystems healthy.

Water stored in pore spaces and fractures under the Earth's surface (&amp;quot;groundwater&amp;quot;) is the largest store of accessible freshwater on the planet, more than 25 times more abundant than surface water. As it constitutes such a large store of freshwater, groundwater is crucial to survival in drylands, providing a reliable water supply through long droughts when surface water stores such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers dry up due to the lack of rainfall to refill them. In order to manage water resources wisely in drylands, it is therefore crucial to know how much groundwater can be pumped for human needs, without reducing its availability for future generations i.e. without 'mining' the groundwater unnecessarily. Some important ecosystems also rely on groundwater where it discharges (flows out of the ground) naturally, through springs and other locations where the water table is close to the ground surface. In the long term we should only take out as much groundwater as is replenished. This replenishment happens naturally when rainfall infiltrates into the ground more quickly than it is removed back to the atmosphere by evaporation or transpiration in a process known as groundwater recharge. At the moment, there is not enough information about how much groundwater recharge occurs in dryland areas and it is therefore impossible to predict how the amount of stored groundwater will change in response to a changing climate.

The central question I want to answer is how much groundwater recharge occurs in drylands which are already short of water and what the main factors are which control when and where this recharge happens. This will be of global societal and economic benefit by helping us manage water resources more effectively, and therefore adapt to future climate change. I plan to achieve this by collating and analysing groundwater level data from drylands globally as well as collecting and analysing new field data from study catchments in specific dryland regions of Tanzania and Australia. I will then build computer models to simulate how the dryland climate and groundwater systems interact with each other, using the new data to check the models are as accurate as possible. I will do this for the study catchments but then use the new knowledge to improve global scale hydrological models which are used for predicting and managing changes in water resources due to changes in climate. Exploring these questions is a fascinating challenge because of the number of ideas from various scientific disciplines (e.g. hydrology, climatology, geology) which need to be brought together creatively. It also gives me an opportunity to contribute to understanding both how and why humans have coped with climate change in the past, and how we can do so in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research aims to improve the understanding and quantification of groundwater recharge in drylands and as such, in addition to the academic beneficiaries outlined elsewhere on the JeS form, will directly benefit (at least) the following: (1) Water planners and policy makers in dryland regions through the development of evidence, methodologies and models to quantify groundwater availability and its relationship to environmental change. (2) Poor communities in central Tanzania and other low-income sub-Saharan African countries with dryland areas reliant on groundwater supplies for safe drinking water and small-scale food production. (3) Large scale farming communities in dryland areas reliant on groundwater supplies for agricultural production in the context of climate change. (4) Regulators and other decision makers carrying out hydrological impact assessment of dryland water resources, for example in the context of agricultural (irrigation) development or onshore hydrocarbon extraction, to protect environmental flows to sensitive and important ecological or heritage sites.

I will realise the impact of my research in these areas by influencing policy development and/or knowledge exchange at international, national and regional levels through the following pathways:

1. International - the research will have wide application to a range of global issues within the food-energy-water nexus currently being addressed by international networks of non-government and quasi-governmental organisations. Since many dryland regions contain transboundary aquifers whose resources are often poorly understood, the research is also of direct relevance to trans-national development and diplomacy initiatives. To this end, I will work in partnership with the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC), a United Nations Educational &amp;amp; Science Organisation (UNESCO) centre who, through the new International Hydrology Programme (IHP-VIII), aims to improve water security in response to local, regional and global challenges.
2. National government level - the research will be of direct relevance to national governments seeking to develop or improve water (and therefore through their intrinsic links, agricultural and energy) policies in dryland areas. Since dryland areas cover more than a third of the world's landmass, the research is thus of global application. To this end I will work specifically with the Tanzanian Ministry for Water and Irrigation as well as the Australian Federal Government's Office of Water Science to ensure my research informs water management policy at the national level.
3. Regional &amp;amp; local level stakeholders - the research has practical application to the management of dryland water resources and ecology, and will be important for local and regional decision makers from farmers to regulatory authorities. To this end I will work with the WamiRuvu Basin Water Office (WRBWO) in central Tanzania as well as the Cotton Research and Development Corporation (CRDC) in NSW Australia, to ensure the findings of my research are directly available to inform local decisions with regard to water management for private and public water supply as well as sustainable agricultural irrigation practices.

The 'Pathways to Impact' attached, and the related Letters of Support, outline how I will seek to work at these three levels through specific institutional partnerships, as well as working towards public engagement through a range of dissemination activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>573933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P017819/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47491D28-C3A9-416A-8459-3ECC0715B776</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth Surface Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EDE0586F-810A-4956-BC26-74CA0D6759F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrogeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D4F391DF-BCE0-47FA-BED7-78025F16B14D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrological Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E94BED75-343A-47C8-BEA1-E1E927732B34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Atmosphere Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
