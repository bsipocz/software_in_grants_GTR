Theorizing the 'is' and the 'ought'</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J023434/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The aim of the study is to rigorously examine what ?good? police custody is, taking into account recent shifts towards civilianisation and privatisation in how police custody is delivered. Police custody is where an arrested person is taken whilst a decision is reached about what should be done with the case, for example whether to charge or bail them. In particular, the aims of the research are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Describe and appraise variations in police custody arrangements across the UK.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Identify the key dimensions of police custody areas (e.g. fairness, justice, cost and accountability).&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Explore how civilianisation and privatisation impact on these key dimensions of police custody.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Conceptualise the dimensions of 'good' police custody and examine the implications for 'good' policing.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>These aims are to be explored through the collection of qualitative and quantitative data over three years, including through surveys, participant observation, interviews and data from official records. The study also intends to make an impact on policy and practice, as the overall findings from the research will be used to develop benchmarks and a survey tool, which will be available for use by key police stakeholders to improve police custody facilities on an on-going basis. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries
- The key stakeholders for the research are the 52 police services in the UK and their Elected Police and Crime Commissioners, as well as Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabularies who inspect police custody facilities, as well as the private sector, including companies such as Reliance and G4S who own, manage and staff a number of police custody facilities. 
- Other stakeholders include representatives from the Home Office, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Police Federation and the Association of Chief Police Officers, the National Policing Improvements Agency (as long as it exists), the Legal Services Commission and Research Centre, the Law Society, as well as third sector organisations such as JUSTICE, INQUIRY and the Howard League. 
- The proposed research will also be of interest to academics and researchers (see the information on Je-S about academic beneficiaries). The research team will also benefit from their involvement in the project, as will their future employers and wider society. The research team will develop management, leadership, research, communication and media skills, enabling them to move forward in their careers in academia or other employment sectors.
- Finally, suspects and citizens are also stakeholders. Suspects may benefit from improvements to police custody and citizens may benefit from greater confidence in the police if they know that custody areas are 'good' and of a high standard.

Key stakeholders will be provided with a better understanding of: 
- How police custody operates in practice and also how it should operate. Much research in the past has focused on police malpractice, whereas the proposed research will examine what constitutes 'good' police custody practices. Such information could be used to enhance public confidence in the police and to increase the likelihood that the public continue to cooperate and engaged with the police in the future.
- Police custody in a local and national perspective. This will enable police organisations to compare themselves with other similar police organisations and help them to understand where they might improve or where they are already good enough.
- How to monitor and improve police custody practices on an ongoing and long-term basis. The research will lead to benchmarks and a survey tool which police organisations can use to measure their performance and which will be complementary to HMIC/HMIP inspections.
- How to balance the need for cost-effective public service delivery with the need for security, fairness, justice, legitimacy and accountability, under austere financial conditions. 

Communication, engagement and long-term impacts
A research advisory group is being created and will meet twice during the project (see also Appendix 1). Progress with the research and emerging findings will be disseminated to stakeholders, research participants and the wider public through bi-annual newsletters, the PI's blog and other social media, such as Twitter. As for longer-term impacts, by the end of Phase 4, knowledge about 'good' police custody practices will be used to create benchmarks. Based on these benchmarks, a survey tool will be developed which can be administered by police services to staff and suspects on an annual basis to measure the quality of police custody. Information gleaned from these surveys will provide additional information that can be drawn on by HMIP/HMIC inspectors when writing their reports. Therefore, the key impact of the study will be the extent to which police organisations adopt the benchmarks and survey tool. Hence an end-of-project conference (for stakeholders with a strategic focus) and a workshop (for operational stakeholders) will be used to promote the benchmark and survey tool.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>421224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Amy Sprawson, Andrew Wooff and Layla Skinns, 'Preliminary findings on communication and legitimacy in police custody' presented to Combiville Police, 28 January 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>370C76D8-6FA6-4386-9CB3-314A0626DC42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk was attended by the Chief Superintendent (responsible for police custody), two Chief Inspector (custody managers), two Inspectors, two Custody Sergeants and a civilian detention officer.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf828b56c2f2.91739171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Andrew Wooff attended the launch of an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission on 'Preventing deaths in detention of adults with mental health conditions', House of Commons, London, 24 February 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>793E35E0-ED71-4BDF-A881-522ADDE6F236</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attended this event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf871e187949.07900603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Amy Sprawson attended a one-day event on 'What if police bail were abolished?'

The benchmarks and survey tool will be promoted to police practitioners, policy makers and other relevant beneficiaries through an end-of-project conference and through free training workshops in January/February 2017. Impact will be measured in five ways:

(i) the extent to which forces participate in and are aware of the GPCS;
(ii) the extent of attendance at and satisfaction with the end-of-project conference and training workshops;
(iii) the extent of uptake and use of the benchmarks and survey tool by police forces in England and Wales;
(iv) the extent to which individual forces, policy makers and law makers alter the law, policy and practice in line with the police custody benchmarks;
(v) the extent to which suspects' experiences of police custody improve (though this is not something that will be directly measured in the present study). 

At this point in the research, it is only possible to comment in detail on the success of the first of these measures. We have had excellent engagement with the research as a result of the emphasis on the 'good', rather than the 'bad'. For example, we had a 93% response rate to the survey administered in Phase 1 of the research, good access to police forces in Phase 2 and we managed to collect data from nearly 800 staff and detainees in 27 custody suites in 13 forces in Phase 3. We receive regular requests for information/assistance from police and other kinds of practitioners. The bi-annual GPCS newsletters have been well received; for example, The Director of Knowledge, Research and Education at the College of Policing described it as &amp;quot;a good model of ongoing communication&amp;quot;.

This research will make an impact by contributing to existing mechanisms for monitoring and reforming police custody. It will also benefit the academic community as theories about 'good' police custody will be used to explore the implications for 'good' or 'good enough' policing (Bowling, 2011), an important topic in the light of the unquenchable thirst for security in contemporary societies and an austere economic climate (Loader and Walker, 2007: 11).

The research has five key aims:
1. Describe and appraise variations in police custody arrangements across England and Wales.
2. Identify the key dimensions of police custody areas (e.g. fairness, justice, cost and accountability).
3. Explore how civilianisation and privatisation impact on these key dimensions of police custody.
4. Conceptualise the dimensions of 'good' police custody and examine the implications for 'good' policing.
5. Develop benchmarks and a survey tool to monitor and improve police custody practices, complementing the inspection work of HMIP/HMIC and existing benchmarks such as the PACE Codes of Practice and Authorised Professional Practice Guidelines (formerly ACPO Safer Detention guidelines).

These aims have been or will be explored through the collection of qualitative and quantitative data in three phases over three years by a team of researchers, including through surveys, participant observation, interviews and data from official records. 

From the phase 1 survey, responded to by 40 forces, five 'types' of police custody suites were identified. These were identified by analysing three key variables: the involvement of the public and private sector; the busyness of the suite (i.e. number of detainees, per cell, per year); and whether respondents to the survey agreed that the suite 'fit for purpose'.

With regards to the public-private sector involvement, three categories were used. A 'public' suite refers to all custody suites that are owned and managed by the police, with non-warranted civilians also employed by the police. The 'private' is the opposite of this, with the suite being owned and managed by the private sector, who also employ civilian staff. These are termed 'private' for linguistic ease, but there is still public sector involvement as police officers still work in these suites. 'Hybrid' suites are those that have both public and private sector involvement, involving any combination of involvement e.g. the police manage and private sector own a custody suite and employ non-warranted staff, or the police manage and employ non-warranted staff but the private sector own the suite.

The most common type of custody suite, overall, is the publicly-run, fit for purpose and busy custody suite, this is type number one, which has been called the hard-pressed public suite. Given that the purpose of the research is to explore and to theorize 'good' police custody practices, it was decided that a not so good unfit for purpose busy publicly-run custody suite would serve as an interesting point of comparison and so this was chosen as type number two, namely, the hard-pressed persevering public suite. 
Hybrid custody suites are also common-place and since virtually all were regarded as fit for purpose, the focus is on these. For these hybrid sites there is a skew towards the 'middling' to 'least busy' end of the scale. Respectively, these represent types three and four, the unhurried hybrid and the hard-working hybrid. 

Though private sites are relatively rare in police forces in England and Wales, they are still a distinct type. As with the hybrid sites, all were regarded by custody managers as fit for purpose and the focus is on these. At the present time, there are too few private custody facilities to observe a clear pattern in terms of busyness. However, it was decided to use the private-busy suite as the fifth type, primarily to aid comparison with the public-busy suite. This is the private super suite.

In Phase 2 of the research we conducted in-depth research in custody suites which represented four of these five types of custody suites. In each of these custody suites, the research team gathered data that corresponded to the following 'key dimensions' of custody: 1) police custody workers; 2) the conditions of custody; 3) the purposes of police custody; 4) discretion; 5) occupational culture(s); 6) power and suspect compliance; 7) access to justice and fairness; 8) detainee and staff responses to police custody; 9) risk; and 10) governance and accountability. 

Data collected on each of these themes has been written up into an, as yet, unpublished report, which is available on request. These data have formed the basis of a series of conference presentations and publications, some of which are in press and some of which are in progress, as follows:

The Phase 2 data were used to construct the survey instrument was used to collect data from staff and suspects in the third and final data collection phase of the study. Between April 2016 and January 2017 a team of six people collected from nearly 800 detainees in 27 custody suites in 13 forces. These data are currently being analysed and written up.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At this stage of the research, we are trying to engage in as much dissemination and impact work as possible. We produce bi-annual newsletters which have been well-received; for example, the Director of Knowledge, Research and Education at the College of Policing described it as &amp;quot;a good model of ongoing communication&amp;quot;. 

The research team have also presented emerging findings at various conferences a including:
