This fundamentally changes how molecules interact with each other, altering chemical reactions and potentially making them precisely controllable via lasers and magnetic fields. In addition to this controlled chemistry, possible applications of molecules at these temperatures include quantum technologies such as portable atomic clocks for use in next-generation GPS and quantum computers that can solve problems way beyond those that confound current supercomputers.

Before these promising advances can be developed, we first need to learn how to cool a wide variety of molecules to the required temperatures, generate further knowledge about how atoms and molecules behave in these extreme conditions, and develop more precise ways of controlling them. This is typically approached by designing and carrying out experiments in exquisite detail, but the input of theoretical quantum chemistry calculations is vital to correctly interpret the results. The aim of this project is to develop new theoretical tools that will increase both the accuracy and efficiency of computing how the energy of these cold systems varies as the relative positions of the atoms/molecules are adjusted, and how the different elements may behave under these conditions. This will require the development of new basis sets for the heavy alkali and alkaline earth metals and combining this with a careful consideration of discrete quantum mechanical effects to develop a computational protocol that can be readily applied to a wide variety of cold matter systems. The first application of the techniques developed is proposed to be an investigation of how calcium fluoride, a molecule that is capable of strong long-range interactions, might be produced at ultracold temperatures through a process known as sympathetic cooling.

The methods developed in this work will be made available and accessible to all, but will be of particular interest to both theoreticians and experimentalists working in the cold matter field. The results will be communicated in such a way that interested parties will easily be able to incorporate the methods into their existing work-flow, accelerating the analysis of results and allowing for better predictions and interpretations to be made. Ultimately the results of this work will guide experiment in the right direction, increasing the speed at which progress is made and preventing expensive experiments being carried out on systems that are unlikely to yield useful results.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this research is to develop theoretical tools that will help to accurately predict the outcome of cold matter experiments and allow scientists working in the field of cold matter to rapidly analyse their results. There is great interest in the physics and chemistry of cold matter because the incredibly cold conditions, a tiny fraction above absolute zero, mean that the somewhat weird effects of quantum mechanics become much more relevant. Quantum mechanics has already given us computers and smartphones (the silicon transistor), CD/DVD players (the laser), GPS and MRI scanners. None of these technologies that we now take for granted could have been predicted when quantum mechanics was first conceived in the early 1900s and it is similarly hard to predict the benefits that cold quantum systems may bring to our lives. However, it is realistic to imagine that the resulting quantum technologies will produce a change similar to one of the products mentioned above. Some of the speculated advances include quantum computing, which will completely revolutionise what computers are capable of, and an era of cold-controlled chemistry, where chemists will have precise control over which bonds are broken/formed and hence be able to efficiently synthesise, for example, new pharmaceuticals.

Realistically, these applications of cold matter science are perhaps ten to fifteen years in the future and before we get there it is vital to first generate knowledge and understanding about how to create cold quantum systems, how they operate, and how we can control them. The UK is internationally recognised for excellence in cold atomic and molecular science, having fostered a number of fundamental breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. The present research will build upon and strengthen this capability by providing scientists with the means to produce truly accurate predictions and insight through computer modelling. This will be delivered by visits to one of the UK-based academic research groups well-established in the cold matter field, ensuring that the tools developed can easily be integrated into their existing workflow. These visits will also make certain that when the research moves into an application phase, the cold matter system investigated will be of timely relevance to UK experimental efforts.

It is apparent that the initial beneficiaries of this work will be academics, and delivering benefits to wider society requires a longer-term strategy of those academics building upon the output of this work to deliver the advances required to capitalise on the promise of cold quantum systems. The UK is already positioning itself to maximise its economic competitiveness in this area through a published Strategy for Stimulating Growth in Quantum Technologies and establishing a network of Quantum Technology Hubs. This means that the pathway for translating the academic advances of this work over to the commercial private sector and eventually into the hands of the public in the form of quantum technologies, such as a quantum computer smartphone, is already established.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D2198A9-2B6E-4F7E-B350-EB5BA179BC86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gaussian basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations.
