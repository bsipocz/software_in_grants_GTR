Enzymes are large, natural molecules that allow specific biochemical reactions to take place quickly, that is to say enzymes are natural catalysts. They are very good catalysts, but as yet we do not understand what it is that makes them such good natural chemists. We need to know how chemical reactions happen in enzymes, something that is very difficult to do by experiments alone. There are many reasons for studying enzymes and the reactions they catalyse: many drugs are enzyme inhibitors (they stop specific enzymes from working), so better understanding of enzymes will help in the design of new drugs. Better understanding of individual enzymes should also help understand and predict the effects of genetic variation, for example in understanding why some people may benefit from a particular drug, or may be at risk from a disease. Enzymes are also very good and environmentally friendly catalysts - knowing how they function should help in the design and development of new 'green' catalysts for forensic, synthetic, analytical and biotechnological applications. Enzymes also show great promise as 'molecular machines' in the emerging field of nanotechnology. We will carry out a collaborative project bringing together experimental biochemistry with advanced computer modelling methods to analyse in detail how a remarkable enzyme works. This enzyme catalyses an unusual reaction, and is used in industrial applications, but it could be improved by making it more efficient, which we hope to do by designing changes to it. We will predict the effects of changes to the enzyme (mutations) by modelling, and test our predictions experimentally. We will develop and apply new high-level modelling methods, capable of dealing accurately with these large and complex systems, and the chemical reactions they catalyse. Carrying out experiments and modelling together will help develop the methods, by testing them predictions, and will also help in interpreting biochemical results and planning new experiments (e.g. designing altered enzymes). We will focus on phosphite dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyses a chemically unique reaction that so far has eluded detailed mechanistic understanding. Current computer modelling methods are useful for studying some aspects of enzyme reactions - they offer the unique potential of making molecular 'movies' of how enzymes work - but have important limitations. For example, large size of enzymes, and the need for intensive calculations, means that current calculations are typically limited to approximate and often unreliable computational methods. Reliable predictions of enzyme catalytic mechanisms require more accurate techniques. We will extend high-level methods, previously validated in studies of chemical reactions of small molecules, to study reactions in enzymes. We will develop new, hybrid methods that can describe the energies of breaking and forming chemical bonds well, and analyse how the reaction is affected by the dynamics of the enzyme. This work will be carried out in collaboration with experimental studies. The experimental data will be essential input for the calculations. We will make predictions and compare with experiments on the same enzyme to test our theoretical methods, use molecular models to analyse and interpret experimental data and test hypotheses about the enzyme reaction mechanism. This collaboration will involve the transfer and exchange of methods, data, ideas and researchers between our labs. The new methods we develop will be made widely available, and should be very useful to biologists, biochemists and other researchers working on biological catalysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>281498</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>188950</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>E/EP/G007705/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>19801541-A839-4046-AD63-5F32048C7015</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ed84c5a5ed84c78</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The first convincing evidence that the amino acid methionine plays a role in catalysis in an enzyme has been uncovered by researchers from the University of Bristol. Previously, it was thought that methionine was only involved in structure and binding, not in making reactions happen in enzymes.

Using molecular simulations, Dr Kara Ranaghan and Professor Adrian Mulholland from Bristol's School of Chemistry found an interesting interaction involving a particular methionine residue in the enzyme phosphite dehydrogenase.

Their collaborators at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, US, led by Professor Wilfred van der Donk, then investigated this effect by mutating the methionine and replacing it with either natural or unnatural amino acids.

These experiments showed that replacing the methionine slowed down the rate of the reaction without significantly changing other properties of the enzyme. This indicates that it is involved in catalysis, that is, in making the reaction happen more quickly in the enzyme.

QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) simulations of the reaction then showed how the methionine is likely to do this by stabilizing a particular group in the protein during the reaction.

Analysis of structural databases by Bristol's Dr Tiddo Mooibroek, Dr Gail Bartlett and Professor Dek Woolfson showed that this type of interaction is also seen in other proteins and other molecules.

Professor Mulholland said: &amp;quot;As our research indicates that this type of interaction is likely to be important in other enzymes, it could ultimately help in the design of new proteins with applications in medicine and bioengineering.&amp;quot; 

This work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the US National Science Foundation through an award for US/UK collaboration in chemistry.

Paper: 'A catalytic role for methionine revealed by a combination of computation and experiments on phosphite dehydrogenase' by Kara E. Ranaghan, John E. Hung, Gail J. Bartlett, Tiddo J. Mooibroek, Jeremy N. Harvey, Derek N. Woolfson, Wilfred A. van der Donk and Adrian J. Mulholland in Chemical Science</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction catalysed by phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) identify Met53 as important for catalysis. This catalytic role is verified by experiments (including replacement by norleucine and selenomethionine), which show that mutation of this residue significantly affects kcat, without changing KM for phosphite. QM/MM and ab initio QM calculations show that the catalytic effect is electrostatic in nature. The side chain of Met53 specifically stabilizes the transition state for the hydride transfer step of the reaction catalysed by PTDH, forming a 'face-on' interaction with His292. To our knowledge, a defined catalytic role for methionine in an enzyme (as opposed to a steric or binding effect, or interaction with a metal ion) has not previously been identified. Analyses of the Protein Data Bank and Cambridge Structural Database indicate that this type of interaction may be relatively widespread, with implications for enzyme-catalysed reaction mechanisms and protein structure.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EF128296-D326-47A1-90D4-0CE9AB25A639</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0bc787d4962.59779591</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2014/february/methionine-in-catalysis.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E4A7BD6-0455-42A7-9F59-F143C78DC474</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computational enzymology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4a25c5b146e774a3fac75a721b566084"><gtr:id>4a25c5b146e774a3fac75a721b566084</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lonsdale R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02c02c6739776</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05C8159F-0556-4191-A13B-8417D7D42808</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optimal control design of laser pulses for mode specific vibrational excitation in an enzyme-substrate complex</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fae3fb636620fa73f3f1d85f2ddb17d3"><gtr:id>fae3fb636620fa73f3f1d85f2ddb17d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ren Q</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfebfeb3c0a2fc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB03728F-FCB5-4C1D-A2FC-D4C435F37435</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigations of enzyme-catalysed reactions with combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Reviews in Physical Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3972a2fe576f5ce5a419b9f38af99e1"><gtr:id>d3972a2fe576f5ce5a419b9f38af99e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ranaghan K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03b03befcaf8b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>16A956E5-27F5-4A5C-B9C3-D17839BE2634</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computer simulations of quantum tunnelling in enzyme-catalysed hydrogen transfer reactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/421a2ab4d7ba0423131ef31345d5075a"><gtr:id>421a2ab4d7ba0423131ef31345d5075a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ranaghan KE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1867-1462</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758de0cc83b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>72355AB9-458A-4234-B6AC-1E1FA84E7FB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis of chorismate mutase catalysis by QM/MM modelling of enzyme-catalysed and uncatalysed reactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic &amp;
