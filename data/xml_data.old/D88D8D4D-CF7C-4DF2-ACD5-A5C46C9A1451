supercoiling</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/H010106/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We propose to bring together three threads of recent progress to develop anew chiral theory of DNA supercoiling. The three threads are i) theelectrostatic theory of interacting helical charge distributions, ii) themechanical theory of elastic braids, and iii) a new efficient approach toderive equilibrium equations for geometric variational problems. The newtheory will for the first time introduce explicitly chiral interactions intothe description of supercoiling, and will uncover the effects driven by theseinteractions. Specifically, we will build a theory to describe foursupercoiling situations: (i) spontaneous formation of free-ended braids,(ii) conformations of braided DNA in single-molecule manipulation experiments,and formation of writhes in (iii) torsionally stressed and (iv) initiallyrelaxed looped DNA, triggered by changing environment.In recent years systematic experimental studies of the torque response ofplectonemically supercoiled and braided DNA have been performed, while moreare anticipated. These require a quantitative theory that better accountsfor the complex DNA-DNA interactions. We will develop that theory. The mainpart of this project is theoretical, but the predictions of the theory willbe tested against new experiments that will be performed in collaborationwith the named Project Partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with the group of Professor Gert Van der Heijden (UCL)-parner on the grant</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBE4E1C8-F0E8-4025-AA21-E8126F6017C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The biologically important problem of DNA braiding was studied in the past by means of dual-DNA magnetic tweezer experiments. In such experiments, two DNA molecules are braided about each other using an externally imposed force and torque. We developed a theoretical model of molecular braiding that includes interactions between molecules, thermal fluctuations, and the elastic response of molecules, all in a consistent manner. This is useful to study the chiral effects of helix-dependent electrostatic interactions on the braid's equilibrium geometrical and mechanical properties. When helix-dependent forces are weak, our model yields a reasonably accurate reproduction of previously measured extension-rotation curves, where only very slight chirality has been observed. On the other hand, when helix-specific electrostatic forces are strong, the model predicts several new features of the extension-rotation curves. These are: (a) a distinct asymmetry between left-handed and right-handed DNA braiding; (b) the emergence, under a critical pulling force, of coexistence regions of tightly and loosely wound DNA; (c) spontaneous formation of left-handed DNA braids at zero external torque (zero bead rotations). Strong chiral forces are expected for braiding experiments conducted in solutions in which there are counter-ions that bind specifically in the DNA grooves. These results are currently being under experimental investigation by the group of G.Wuite at free University of Amsterdam.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddd3fc9eb0b1.43151864-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The UCL group provided original, and advance theory of mechanical properties of plectonemes and performed some simulations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have provide a theory of chiral electrostatic interactions between DNA in sulutions including the theory of torsional elasticity and fluctuations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr. Tim Albrecht (Imperial) on different physical methods of experimental investigation of relaxed and supercoiled closed loop DNA.</gtr:description><gtr:id>79751F69-C621-4A56-8FD7-A35CED452157</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The experiments has not been finalized due to the lack of funds.

The electrostatics problem of two DNA molecules (helical charged rods) in a generalized braided configuration was solved when the pitch of the braid was long compared to the Debye screening length and the tilt angle small, and a mathematical formalism for generalized braids was built to handle later developments based on the mathematical analytical approaches of the UCL partnering team on this grant.

 2. A prediction of the spontaneous braiding of helically charged molecules was made, based on a physical theory. Spontaneous braiding of three actin molecules has indeed been observed [T. Ikawa, F. Hoshino, Y. Li, P. Pincus, C. R. Safinya, Phys. Rev. Lett., 98, 018101 (2007)], though not yet for two DNA molecules. Our study suggested that this might only happen under particular ionic conditions, perhaps only for homologous molecules. 

 3. A model of DNA supercoiling was developed that included helix specific electrostatic forces. Such forces could make the free energy asymmetric with respect to left and right handed supercoiling. When helix specific forces, which favours, as found, left-handed braiding (writhing) were important, the supercoil collapsed into a tightly supercoiled state with left-handed writhing. It was found that with such a transition, due the constraint in the linking number, the DNA twist had to change. 
 
4. A theory was developed for the statistical mechanics of regular symmetric braids formed by molecules interacting through forces that depend on the helical structure. In such braid the average centre lines of the two molecules precess with uniform period about the line axis that is equidistant from the centre lines of each of the two molecule. This theory included undulations of the molecules as well as twisting fluctuations.
 
5. A model was suggested and developed describing the mechanical braiding of two molecules as in the experiments of G. Charvin, A. Vologodskii, D. Bensimon, V. Croquette, Biophys. J., 88, 4124 (2005). Applying our statistical mechanical theory of braiding to the case when helix specific forces were weak, this model fitted the experimental data well. The data have shown a slight asymmetry, and it was postulated that new type of helix-helix correlation forces could be responsible for this. These correlation forces involved azimuthal orientation of one helix, correlating with the other helix. This model was used to predict the qualitative features of such experiments for such molecules, for instance DNA, where helix specific forces are of electrostatic nature and are strong, and in which the effects of undulations of the molecules have been included. 

7. A model to rationalize the chiral effects observed in the braiding experiments of the Wuite group has also been developed. We hope to use to extract information from their experiments about the force between the molecules in their braids, when the experiments got completed.

8. Recent studies of counterion-induced condensation of nucleic acid helices into aggregates in the group of Professor Lois Pollack and the former group of Dr Parsegian at NIH produced several puzzling observations. For instance, trivalent cobalt hexamine ions condensed double-stranded (ds) DNA oligomers but not their more highly charged dsRNA counterparts. Divalent alkaline earth metal ions condensed triple-stranded (ts) DNA oligomers but not dsDNA. We developed a detailed theory which shows that these counterintuitive experimental results can be rationalized within the Kornyshev-Leikin electrostatic zipper model of interactions between molecules with helical charge motifs. 
This theory reveals dramatic and nontrivial interplay between the effects of helical structure and thermal rotational fluctuations (which are particularly strong for short oligomers) on electrostatic interaction between oligomeric nucleic acids. Combining predictions for oligomeric and much longer helices, we have also interpret recent experimental studies of the role of counterion charge, structure, and chemistry. These results suggest that an electrostatic zipper attraction might be a major or even dominant force in nucleic acid condensation.

9. The theory of X-ray diffraction from ideal, rigid helices allowed Watson and Crick to unravel the DNA structure, thereby elucidating functions encoded in it. Yet, as we know now, the DNA double helix is neither ideal nor rigid. Its structure varies with the base pair sequence. Its flexibility leads to thermal fluctuations and allows molecules to adapt their structure to optimize their intermolecular interactions. In addition to the double helix symmetry revealed by Watson and Crick, classical X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA contain information about the flexibility, interactions and sequence-related variations encoded within the helical structure. To extract this information, we have developed a new diffraction theory that accounts for these effects. We show how double helix non-ideality and fluctuations broaden the diffraction peaks. Meridional intensity profiles of the peaks at the first three helical layer lines reveal information about structural adaptation and intermolecular interactions. The meridional width of the fifth layer line peaks is inversely proportional to the helical coherence length that characterizes sequence-related and thermal variations in the double helix structure. Analysis of measured fibre diffraction patterns based on this theory yields important parameters that control DNA structure, packing and function. Our analysis of the fine structure of fifth layer line as obtained in the experiments of the group of Z.B. Zimmerman (at NIH) has shown that helical coherence length of DNA is close to 11 nm.

10. Mutual recognition of homologous sequences of DNA before strand exchange is considered to be the most puzzling stage of recombination of genes. In 2001, a mechanism was suggested for a double stranded DNA molecule to recognize from a distance its homologous match in electrolytic solution without unzipping [Kornyshev AA,
Leikin S (2001) Phys Rev Lett 86:3666-3669]. Based on a theory of electrostatic interactions between helical molecules, the difference in the electrostatic interaction energy between homologous duplexes and between nonhomologous duplexes, called the recognition energy, was calculated. Now we have performed a theoretical investigation of the form of the potential well that DNA molecules may feel sliding along each other. This well, the bottom of which is determined by the recognition energy, leads to trapping of the molecular tracks of the same homology in direct juxtaposition. A simple formula for the shape of the well is obtained for torsionally rigid molecule. The well is quasi-exponential. Its half-width is determined by the helical coherence length, introduced first in the same 2001 article, the value of which, as the above mentioned analysis of experimental X-ray diffraction patterns is close to 11 nm. More involved theory was developed for a recognition well (recognition funnel) for torsionally elastic molecules. An ability of torsional adaptation reduces the well. However, based on the estimates that rest on known DNA torsional elastic moduli, the well remains yet substantial for the molecules sliding along each other to stop in 1-1 homology-to-homology juxtaposition. Note that we do not need the funnel to be too deep as the DNA molecules must have a chance for easy departure after the recombination takes place.
Last but not least we have proved that the homology recognition well practically disappears when two homologous DNA molecules scan each other oriented in opposite direction. This is extremely important for experimental tests on the level of single molecule experiments, because the control experiment can be made with the DNA molecules of the same sequences but just oriented in the opposite way.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The effects of spontaneous braiding and formation of plectonemes between homologous tracts of DNA will be tested in the laboratory of Dr. Tim Albrecht (Imperial) in his experiments on DNA translocation through nanopores, and in cooperation with the group of Prof. Takeyasu (Kyoto University) in fast AFM and with the group of Dr. Liming Ying (Imperial College) dynamic FRET experiments. A big grant proposal to EPSRC on the subject was filed, but as we have been recently informed it was in the end not funded. We will need to look at other source of funding, possibly together with our US partners at Harvard (Professor Mara Prentiss) and NYU (Kavli Laureate, Professor N.Seeman). 

In collaboration with us, Mara Prentiss has already performed crucial single molecule experiments, showing folding of a synthetic DNA with two long identical tracts running within each DNA molecule in opposite directions; using magnetic beads she has also measured the force needed to unfold such molecule and have demonstrated that it is substantially larger than for control molecules that do not contain such tracts and responds to unfolding exactly as a worm-like chain. A joint paper on this subject have been submitted for publication. 

New theory of X-ray diffraction from DNA opens new opportunities to extract further information about the statistical characteristics of DNA structure. 

The predictions concerning left handed braiding and chiral effects in the structure of DNA plectonemes are currently navigating four-bead experiments of Professor Gijs Wuite at Free University of Amsterdam. 

Altogether, when the homology recognition effects between DNA in protein free solutions, a consequence of the distorted chiral structure of DNA, as predicted initially by Kornyshev and Leikin and developed in this project, will get verified, it will be a big issue. Novel, earlier unknown property encoded into the unique structure of the most important molecule will be experimentally proved. The focus of work will then be to demonstrate how this hidden ability of DNA can manifest itself in interaction and recognition of genes with nucleosomes on them, and later in chromatin. All this is about one of the remaining great puzzles of molecular genetics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0581A149-CD7A-4D7C-9B8B-4B24776158B5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddbeace19754.28905467</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F8D59A3-93BA-4752-8493-44F4E6EF97BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electrostatic braiding and homologous pairing of DNA double helices.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39d87fcda4f71be657e4ad3fb0d53324"><gtr:id>39d87fcda4f71be657e4ad3fb0d53324</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cortini R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3495</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc488dddcc5.92069800</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04C7A361-78C8-416F-B211-67878713DFD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Homology recognition funnel.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e67125a6fd1118456a2de99a8e1f1681"><gtr:id>e67125a6fd1118456a2de99a8e1f1681</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc5e742b587.26074757</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93046A9B-0F87-4826-9195-09DD6294BA01</gtr:id><gtr:title>Theory of phase segregation in DNA assemblies containing two different base-pair sequence types</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Journal of Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e67125a6fd1118456a2de99a8e1f1681"><gtr:id>e67125a6fd1118456a2de99a8e1f1681</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b409adf089.33250218</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6DD8263C-D938-4D26-B223-EFABE44B309E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Theory and simulations of toroidal and rod-like structures in single-molecule DNA condensation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/39d87fcda4f71be657e4ad3fb0d53324"><gtr:id>39d87fcda4f71be657e4ad3fb0d53324</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cortini R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56ddcc30e98e94.94571476</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>079327C6-DB41-42E0-BECA-FA9E9A70C1A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Physics of DNA: unravelling hidden abilities encoded in the structure of 'the most important molecule'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b3ffe6519220cc9c6c44d735e78548e8"><gtr:id>b3ffe6519220cc9c6c44d735e78548e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kornyshev A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc4db32fa30.66776650</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31108700-034F-4F3C-8D6B-9E19869AFA14</gtr:id><gtr:title>From biologically-inspired physics to physics-inspired biology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
