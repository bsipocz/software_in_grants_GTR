The aim of this research project is to study in detail Stebbing's work and life in order to explore themes and address questions of current relevance. The research will be conducted by means of consulting a wide variety of written sources, including the published writings of Stebbing and of her contemporaries, archives of Stebbing's letters and papers in Cambridge and in London that have not previously been discussed in published work, and relevant work on twentieth century social history. The research project will result in a book that addresses the specific issues outlined below.\n\nStebbing was acquainted with many of the leading philosophical figures of her day and was a frequent commentator on contemporary philosophical developments. But she was also significant in the development of philosophy in her own right. She was a champion of women's educational rights, a prominent woman philosopher at a time when there were few woman philosophers at all and the first woman to hold a chair in philosophy in Britain. She was a leading member of the 'Cambridge school of analysis', which was dedicated to the logical analysis of language. However, unlike others in that school she argued for the importance of using everyday, rather than artificial or logically perfect language in philosophical analysis. This approach is more usually associated with the 'ordinary language philosophers' who were active a little while after Stebbing. A careful examination of Stebbing's writings on language therefore suggests an earlier start for the philosophical interest in ordinary language than is generally acknowledged, and greater continuity between the methods of 'ideal' and of 'ordinary' language philosophy. This is significant to pragmatics, the field of linguistics concerned with meaning in use, which drew heavily on ordinary language philosophy in its development. A study of Stebbing's work suggests that pragmatics has deeper roots in more mainstream philosophy than has generally been acknowledged.\n\nStebbing's interest in formal philosophy was always linked to practical applications. Her later writings were aimed at a non-specialist or popular audience and were concerned with the political and social implications of language use. Her most successful book was Thinking to Some Purpose (1939), for many years a paperback bestseller. In this and other work she discussed the importance of clarity and precision in language and therefore in thought, illustrating her arguments with passages from newspapers, political speeches and advertisements. She discussed a number of issues that are still highly topical, including the necessity of clarity in how scientists and other specialists communicate their ideas to a wider audience; the importance of critical awareness of the language used by public communicators, particularly those who are trying to persuade their audience to a particular point of view; and the significance of how individuals and societies choose to label and define groups, policies and ideals. Stebbing was motivated by her concerns about both social inequality and the rising danger of Fascism. An investigation of this aspect of her work can contribute to our understanding of a growing awareness among social commentators of the time of the importance of critical attention to the use of language, particularly by those in positions of political or social prestige. Further, the types of text that Stebbing analysed have been focussed on in relatively new branches of linguistics, suggesting that her work can be seen as an early forerunner of, for instance, critical discourse analysis, which seeks to reveal the ideological commitments underlying linguistic choices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The nature of the research project, the production of a scholarly monograph, entails that its most immediate and obvious beneficiaries will be within academia. It will benefit researchers in linguistics and the philosophy of language, and may also inform their teaching, to the benefit of their undergraduate and postgraduate students.\n\nHowever, there are also many potential beneficiaries among the wider public. Stebbing is more likely than many figures from the history of philosophy to appeal to the general public outside of academia because of a number of features of her career and work. These features have the potential to impact on a number of topics of current cultural interest and debate. She was a champion of women's educational rights and the first woman professor of philosophy in Britain. She worked with many of the leading figures of British twentieth century society. Her writings included topics of great current popular interest, including the public communication of science, the use of ideologically loaded language in political speeches and propaganda and the persuasive use of language in advertising. Her writings on precision and clarity have resonances in current popular discussions of the importance of linguistic correctness and of 'plain English', while her views on the importance of the way in which groups and individuals are labeled and described by a society relate closely to current interest in 'political correctness'. Stebbing's popular culture appeal is evidenced by the fact that Thinking to Some Purpose was for many years a best selling paperback and is now represented by a Pelican Book Mug.\n\nStebbing's work, then, includes a number of themes of current popular interest, suggesting the possibility both of public engagement on my part and also of many longer term and indirect beneficiaries of this research project. I have some experience of engaging with public interest in philosophy; in 2009 I gave a public lecture in Oslo on the work of Arne Naess. I have outlined some of the way in which I might enter into public engagement in relation to this project in my 'Pathways to Impact'. One way in which interested members of the general public might become indirect beneficiaries of this research is if it informs more overtly popular writing. An example of a recent popular book on a topic related to this research project is Jane Robinson's Blue Stockings (Penguin Viking 2009), on the history of women's education and status in universities, which draws on scholarly as well as more mainstream sources. Members of the general reading public would be likely to become indirect beneficiaries in this way some time after the completion of this research project.\n\nThere is also considerable public interest in philosophy itself. For instance, the recent designation of Malmesbury as Britain's 'philosophy town', with considerable potential for tourist revenue, has been attributed to a growing public appetite for philosophy (Guardian, 18th October 2010). The results of this research project that are concerned with specifically philosophical themes might also be used by researchers for relevant television and radio programmes. Popular interest in philosophical topics and the lives and contributions of individual philosophers is apparent in, for instance, the current 'In Our Time' series on BBC Radio 4, the on-going 'Philosophy &amp;amp; Ethics' television programmes run by the BBC in conjunction with the Open University and the recent BBC television series 'Human all too Human'.\n\nThere is also scope for cultural impact of this research in the third sector, in relation to public exhibition. The National Portrait Gallery has a collection of photographic portraits of Stebbing taken by Howard Coster in 1939.

Susan Stebbing (1885-1943), the first woman professor of philosophy in Britain, and the author of a number of popular books, including 'Thinking to Some Purpose' (1939). I have traced her professional and personal associations with many of the leading philosophers of her day, including G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, A. J. Ayer and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Stebbing's early writings were concerned with formal logic, but she came increasingly to believe in the importance of exposing misleading uses of language in, for instance, popular works of science, advertisements, newspaper editorials and political propoganda. In this project I was able to consider the historical developments and the personal, social and political commitments that contributed to this belief. I was also able to assess Stebbing's work in the light of subsequent developments both in analytic philosophy and in linguistics, and suggest that it has importnat contributions to make in both fields.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of my project might lead to greater recognition of the importnce of Stebbing as a figure in twentieth century analytic philosophy, and her potential significance to the academic study of language.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0EA0EE07-A491-4112-BFAE-69CB4F384633</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b2337d739077.63631557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CF30C58-EABD-4EB8-8B0F-A9220BC5E949</gtr:id><gtr:title>Susan Stebbing and the Language of Common Sense</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/804a4815ec5b9c72fe4784e2d6d9619f"><gtr:id>804a4815ec5b9c72fe4784e2d6d9619f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chapman Siobhan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780230302907</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54478d28c705d5.01150835</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026006/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
