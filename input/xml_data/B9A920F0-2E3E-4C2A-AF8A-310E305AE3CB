In particular, molecular methods are now sufficiently developed to enable their use in the DNA- and organic chemical-rich environment of soils. We will test existing, and develop new, molecular and other methods to identify key soil microorganisms and their function and link these to the biogeochemical cycling processes that they mediate. We will begin with nitrogen cycling because (1) nitrogen is the main yield-determining nutrient in crop-based systems and the loss of nitrogen from cropping systems represents an economic loss to the farmer and pollutes air and water; (2) we have made excellent process in developing molecular techniques to study nitrifying organisms and want to extend this to denitrifying organisms.

The main objectives of this project are:
1) To validate DNA/RNA based methods for profiling microorganisms involved in key biogeochemical cycling processes, beginning with microbial species involved in nitrogen cycling processes, specifically denitrification.
2) To investigate the relationship between process and function, beginning with the link between N2O fluxes and functional gene expression.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>454448</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The importance of soil biology/biodiversity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CBEEAC1-E44D-42AD-8AD1-BA9CA7C6F0F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Informal discussion with farmers at a Natural England soil biology workshop and farm walk Presentations by Matthew Shepherd and I to the farmer group and then a farm walk, discussing soil biodiversity at several locations around the farm None

There are simple farm management options that can limit emissions, either by stopping or slowing nitrification or by encouraging denitrification through to its end product dinitrogen gas (N2), thus closing the nitrogen cycle begun by nitrogen fixation. These are 'win'wins' in that they are appropriate to general good soil management and include maintaining soil organic matter levels and good soil structure, avoiding compaction and waterlogging and applying fertilisers and manures at appropriate times and rates.



We also explored novel mathematical methods of studying the variation of nitrous oxide emissions across the landscape at scales of 1 m to 7 km. This showed that different factors seems to control emissions at different scales, e.g. soil nitrate content at up to 1 m but clay content and pH at larger scales, e.g. 1 km. This warns against the simple 'scaling up' of results from the laboratory or field plot to the field or landscape.



The research is ongoing, continuing in a current project. To date it appears not to be possible to manage the microorganisms other than through maintaining good soil structure (maintaining adequate soil organic matter, avoding compaction and waterlogging) and avoiding applying excess nitrogen as fertiliser or manure.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>291626B0-AEFF-48F2-BF72-56CEED7E0CB7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54217639167be0.45040950</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key finding from this project was a better understanding of the microbial basis of nitrogen cycling in soils, especially the process of denitrification. The project developed methods to extract the DNA of the soil organisms that mediate (i.e. cause) the various stages of the process of denitrification: nitrate to nitrite to nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and finally dinitrogen gas (N2). Using these methods we have been able to study the factors that control the process and, especially, those that determine how much of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide is produced. We can then suggest management options for reducing nitrous oxide emissions.

This attracted thousands of public visitors. Exploitation routes are via presentations and discussions with farmers and advisors and the formulation of advice in the UK 'Fertiliser Manual (RB209)', the revision of which in 2010 was led by Rothamsted. The aim is to guide on the more effieicnt use of nitrogen fertilisers, manures and other 'biosolids' for optimum crop production but minimal environmental impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4EC113A9-8AC1-43D8-B0E0-97FF65354538</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3110420576.399584774cd99a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/agec/mme_front.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A new version of the Electronic Rothamsted Archive (eRA) has been launched: http://www3.rothamsted.ac.uk/cdera/extract/pages/data_extraction_prototype6.html.
