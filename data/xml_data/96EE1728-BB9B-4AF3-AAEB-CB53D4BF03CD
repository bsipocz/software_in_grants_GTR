The focus of the research is an examination of the experiences of the 3200 SOE-FANYs who were employed as coders, wireless operators and secretaries in Britain, North Africa and Italy. The FANY, which was the first women's service, recruited mainly upper-class members and it was their exclusive class background which recommended them to SOE's executive head as responsible young women who could be relied upon to undertake highly confidential work.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The research will address the gaps in the work on women's wartime contributions by focusing on upper-class women and in so doing offer new insights into the ways in which the Second World War affected gender, class, race and national identities. It will also explore the ways in which the SOE-FANYs have been remembered in memorials, museum exhibitions, in print and on screen in order to contribute to debates on commemoration.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The project will examine sources largely unused for academic research by consulting recently released official documents and interviewing veterans who are unlikely to have been the subject of study.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings yet to be disseminated.

Class and gender differences were maintained, conventional gender roles were strengthened and pre-war social barriers remained intact. 

2) Rather than leading to social levelling as traditional historians have argued, my research supports the findings of revisionists since the SOE-FANYs? experiences during the Second World War reinforced the women?s class identity. 

3) Despite being integrated into a paramilitary organisation, undertaking work of extreme secrecy which pushed against the boundaries of acceptable feminine war work and transgressing into male spaces by working in overseas stations that were close to the fighting, gender differences were maintained and the SOE-FANYs did not challenge conventional gender norms as they were employed in work which utilised skills tagged as feminine.

4) While revisionist historians have disputed the emancipatory effect of the Second World War upon women which traditionalists have propounded, the personal testimonies that I collected reveal that the SOE-FANYs themselves felt changed by the experience, yet they had difficulty in articulating concrete transformations. 

5) Interviewees denied the significance of gender and class, composed accounts that upheld the FANY identity and reputation and suppressed stories that might threaten it. Moreover, the FANY legend centred on the motto ?I Cope? provided a framework upon which interviewees could hang their own personal recollections of the war and fitting their memories into this generalised account provided a sense of composure.

6) The SOE-FANYs have been overshadowed by the focus upon the operational female agents and have been omitted from memory projects of the Second World War, such as museum exhibitions, online memory archives and television documentaries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be of interest to academics and students as upper class women haven't been the focus of research to date. 

It will also be of use to the FANY organisation which celebrated its centenary in 2007.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E0048ED-E369-4750-9FCB-D9C315DA222D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54524667a2a741.96901366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E7CAC72D-8E2E-46DB-8ED0-14AA78C17620</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The thing that made me hesitate ': re-examining gendered intersubjectivities in interviews with British secret war veterans</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Women's History Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f63b2c952f1f1add60d48ca9d2f86000"><gtr:id>f63b2c952f1f1add60d48ca9d2f86000</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pattinson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9af9acbabd56</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E005276/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-1893</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
