Plants have evolved many complex pathways that are necessary for recognising, relaying and responding to these environmental signals. The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) functions in one such pathway, controlling growth and development in response to many environmental factors, including light, temperature and stress. The study of mutant plants that are deficient in GA production has confirmed that these hormones act largely by promoting growth. In the absence of GAs, plant growth is prevented through the action of the DELLA proteins, which act as growth repressors. When plants are exposed to specific environmental conditions that favour growth, the GA pathway is triggered through the production of the hormone. The increased levels of GAs promote the rapid removal of the DELLAs, allowing increased plant growth. In recent years, there have been dramatic advances in our understanding of the components that are responsible for the production of the GA hormone, and how specific environmental signals lead to their activation. In addition, the mechanisms and components by which GAs trigger the removal of the DELLA growth repressors are now well understood. However, very little is known about the role of DELLAs as growth repressors and how their absence leads to increased plant growth. It is believed that DELLAs act by regulating the levels of multiple components that are directly responsible for controlling plant growth. However, the identity of these components, and the mechanisms by which DELLAs control their levels are poorly understood. The work outlined in this proposal aims to improve understanding of this part of the GA signalling pathway. The role of the GA pathway in controlling growth has been intensively studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This work has demonstrated that this pathway is responsible for stimulating growth throughout the plant, including the roots and hypocotyls. Our recent studies have illustrated the importance of focussing on specific aspects of plant growth, rather than the whole plant, if we are to understand how DELLAs function and identify their downstream targets. The aim of this project is to identify the immediate DELLA targets in Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls, to determine their role in controlling GA-dependent growth and to understand the mechanisms by which DELLAs control their levels in the plant. This will be achieved by identifying components that act in concert with DELLAs and investigating their function in the GA signalling pathway. Our ultimate aim is to understand how DELLAs control different aspects of GA-dependent growth through a myriad of downstream targets. Considering the demonstrated potential to improve agronomic traits through modification of the GA pathway, it is likely that this knowledge will ultimately lead to an improvement in these traits in major crop plants.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In recent years there have been major advances in our understanding of how the plant hormone, gibberellin (GA) is perceived and this signal transduced, leading to changes in growth and development. The DELLA proteins (DELLAs) are central to this signalling cascade, and act as repressors of GA-responsive growth. GA signalling relieves the repression exerted through DELLAs by targeting their degradation through an ubiquitin-proteasome mediated process, which is well understood. In contrast, our understanding of the role of DELLAs in repressing GA-responsive growth is very limited. Although it is thought that DELLAs act as transcriptional regulators, their mode of action is not clear and no target genes have been identified. The work outlined in this proposal is aimed at improving our understanding of the role of DELLAs and their downstream target genes in regulating GA-responsive growth in Arabidopsis. Our proposed strategy involves using a combination of microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to identify early GA-responsive genes that are the primary targets of the DELLAs. We will focus on specific GA-responsive tissues, rather than the whole plant. To uncover the role of these DELLA target genes in regulating GA-responsive growth, we will use a reverse genetics-based strategy. Based on the probable absence of a canonical DNA-binding domain in the DELLAs, it is likely that they regulate the expression of GA-responsive genes through their interaction with other transcription factors. To identify these components we will perform yeast two-hybrid screens using a DELLA bait construct. Putative DELLA interactors will be confirmed by testing the interactions in vivo. Furthermore, their roles in GA signalling will be assessed by analysing the phenotype of knock-out mutants.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489856</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Additive Manufacturing</gtr:department><gtr:description>The impact of heat stress on wheat pollen development</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA5856B7-E3CD-4792-900A-2BCC4307F4B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Identification of transcriptional events that occur during pollen development in response to heat stress.

This data has been used in an integrated mathematical modelling study (in collaboration with Prof. Malcolm Bennett's group at the University of Notttingham) to understand the role of homeostatic feedback modulation on the GA signalling pathway.

Screens for DELLA-interacting proteins have identified many potential candidates that have a role in controlling gibberellin (GA) responsive growth. Of particular interest are those transcritpional regulators that are central to other phytohormone signalling pathways, including auxin, jasmonate, cytokinin and brassinosteroids (BR). These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the observed crosstalk between GA and these other phytohormone signalling pathways. In the case of GA and BR crosstalk, we have demonstrated that DELLAs interact with the BR signalling component BZR1 to restrict its transcriptional activity.

To gain a better understand of how DELLAs control GA-responsive growth, we have focused on the role of these proteins in regulating pollen development. DELLAs are known to block pollen development but the molecular mechanisms controlling this are not understood. We have screened of an Arabidopsis anther yeast 2-hybrid library (in collaboration with Prof. Zoe Wilson's group at the University of Notttingham) and identfied a novel class of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (TFs) which interact with DELLAs. Our subsequent genetic analysis has demonstrated that these TFs are important for regulating pollen development through their control of tapetum development. Their importance in regulating GA-responsive growth is currently being investigated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>During the 'Green Revolution' of the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of dwarfing genes in rice and wheat led to the breeding of dramatically higher yielding crops. These important dwarfing genes have been shown to be altered versions of those encoding key gibberellin (GA) signalling components. In the case of wheat, the Rht-1 dwarfing genes, which are currently present in more than 70% of UK grown wheat varieties, encode altered DELLA proteins. Therefore understanding how DELLA proteins control plant growth and development is essential if we hope to achieve the improvements in cereal yields that will be necessary to feed a rapidly expanding global population. Although Rht-1 dwarfing genes lead to substantial yield improvements they also have unwanted side effects than can impact on yields. For example, they lead to reduced seedling vigour and can also reduce tolerance to environmental stresses (such as heat tolerance during pollen development). By understanding DELLA function there is the potential to manipulate specific growth responses to remove the adverse effects that are observed in the Rht-1 dwarf varieties. This project has provided a wealth of information regarding the potential mechanisms of how DELLA proteins control growth and development. This has led to the establishment of collaborations between our group and 5 leading international research groups (Prof. Zoe Wilson at the University of Notttingham, Prof. Malcolm Bennett at the University of Notttingham, Dr Miguel Blazguez at CSIC-UPV, Dr Ari Sadanandom at the University of Durham and Dr Ray Owens at OPPF-UK, Research Complex at Harwell. All of these collaborations are aimed at improving our understanding of how DELLAs control plant growth and development by focussing on the role of these interacting partners.

One of the primary aims of this follow-up work is to establish whether DELLAs interact with various partners through different mechanisms. If this is established to be the case there is the potential to manipulate specific aspects of GA-responsive growth in plants through this pathway.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C42DD501-4E74-4692-9EA7-377740CEED8A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6487089634.39528757749c55c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>47401663-5A7E-4050-B59E-82D61BEDCA63</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mathematical modeling elucidates the role of transcriptional feedback in gibberellin signaling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4abb399edbe01a10af766192dc47c1c4"><gtr:id>4abb399edbe01a10af766192dc47c1c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Middleton AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5458fc85467809.47314304</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>46716E12-C983-49EE-9C7B-0A06BA9736FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>The early inflorescence of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates positional effects in floral organ growth and meristem patterning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant reproduction</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/be4554c61c6f0be92dc6bfe4c3fb91fb"><gtr:id>be4554c61c6f0be92dc6bfe4c3fb91fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Plackett ARG</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2194-7953</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa78f6108da06.24826068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEF5C84B-1488-45C6-941E-DB24433032EB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gibberellin control of stamen development: a fertile field.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f28eec023ef767c016c75d7f795bc6cb"><gtr:id>f28eec023ef767c016c75d7f795bc6cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Plackett AR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1360-1385</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa78f613c2104.32277322</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8252B1DB-F4DE-43FF-9D4F-1B9B0F1894C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>DELLA activity is required for successful pollen development in the Columbia ecotype of Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The New phytologist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f28eec023ef767c016c75d7f795bc6cb"><gtr:id>f28eec023ef767c016c75d7f795bc6cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Plackett AR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-646X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5458fcbb889e40.07814504</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D89E1138-D2C7-4242-BCF7-146756CAC46F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genome Wide Binding Site Analysis Reveals Transcriptional Coactivation of Cytokinin-Responsive Genes by DELLA Proteins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6066f2ac3a0e811e7c3edec15ef3fd2b"><gtr:id>6066f2ac3a0e811e7c3edec15ef3fd2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mar?n-de la Rosa N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-7390</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e7b66601d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5036850A-F797-4FA6-B762-098224F338D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Molecular mechanism for the interaction between gibberellin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7677686c1b1d5c6bd4a0567184b9ff27"><gtr:id>7677686c1b1d5c6bd4a0567184b9ff27</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gallego-Bartolom?
