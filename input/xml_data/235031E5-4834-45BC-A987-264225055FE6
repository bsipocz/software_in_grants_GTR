One difficulty that has confronted me again and again is the serious lack of English translations of primary source material on Soviet music, which hampers not only undergraduates taking course in this area, but also graduate students, since even those working directly on Russian topics usually have insufficient Russian for searching through large expanses of archival material in a reasonable period of time. This continuing difficulty has prompted me to create a reader in Soviet music criticism for the period which is of great interest but little understood in the West, namely the 1920s. \n\nThe period between the October Revolution of 1917 and the establishment of state run artists' unions in 1932 saw a flourishing of musical activity / modernist experiments, attempts at creating universal music education, and a very lively body of writing on music from diverse and often competing artistic factions. Many viewed the world around them as something they could freely remake according to their own needs, both on the level of grand artistic projects, and everyday attempts to beautify lives led in the difficult circumstances of the Civil War and the economic collapse it brought. Musicians debated the direction music should take, whether there should be a 'revolution in music' in the shape of a modernist rupture with tradition, or alternatively the creation of 'music for the Revolution', to embody new ideas and communicate them efficiently to the masses, in which case the medium could not afford to be forbiddingly new. As revolutionary hopes began to die, and artists began to compete for limited funds, the aesthetic debates became a struggle for the 'survival of the fittest', where internationalist modernists clashed with more inward-looking 'proletarianists' who prescribed a diet of revolutionary songs and marches for the masses. The background to these battles was a colourful musical life: Wagner's operas playing to enthusiastic but frozen audiences, former church composers making arrangements of the Internationale, avant-gardist 'noise' orchestras in the factories, pioneering work on electric instruments, together with visits from Bart&amp;oacute;k and Hindemith and the arrival of jazz. This teeming variety is expressed at different levels of sophistication, from the first hastily assembled ideas of the proletarianists to the rich and urbane work of early Soviet men of letters such as the Culture Minister Anatoly Lunacharsky or the outstanding music scholar Boris Asafyev.\n\nThe wide range of material and the excitement of the period will ensure that the reader will be highly engaging not merely for a narrow circle of scholars, but for a much wider audience taking in all those interested in 20th-century Russian culture (the vast number of successful events across the world marking the Shostakovich centenary demonstrates just how large this audience is). The material presented will throw light upon a range of general issues, such as far-reaching educational reforms, or the progressive bureaucratic control of Soviet culture. Finally, a number of reviews will further illuminate the Soviet reception of Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and the young Shostakovich.\n\nGiven the rapidly changing terrain, I have decided to organize the reader chronologically (year by year), rather than thematically. Each section will open with an introduction, chronicling the most important events of the year and providing the necessary context-setting for the chosen material. A substantial amount of detailed commentary will be available to readers in the footnotes, including information drawn from many archival sources.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20497</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D8B5DE7-E7C7-4CEF-B391-AE326C4E186F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Opera and Obsolescence in the Russian Culture Wars</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Opera Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/21661e336e70354ae60da268f4cb52f7"><gtr:id>21661e336e70354ae60da268f4cb52f7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Frolova-Walker M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d04704799370c6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004524/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3BFAE48F-77C7-453F-8049-A1455B8B0E96</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
