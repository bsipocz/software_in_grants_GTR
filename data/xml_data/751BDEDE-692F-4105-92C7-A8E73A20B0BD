Yet our knowledge of the crucial initial phases of contact remains patchy and incomplete. The proposed project will make available for the first time an edition of texts that can enhance our understanding of those elusive early years. It will establish the importance of these strategically significant parts of the world as improvisational 'contact zones', before the establishment of subsequent, often highly asymmetrical, colonial and imperial relationships.

The edition will be published by Oxford University Press as volume 6 of the complete edition of Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation (1598-1600). Hakluyt is arguably the single most important figure in the history of English travel writing, and his Principal Navigations, the most important English collection of such accounts. First printed in 1589, the hugely expanded second edition (1598-1600) runs to approximately 1,760,000 words. Standard recommended reading onboard trading ships at the time, it also exerted enormous influence on the English imagination. It has long been recognised for its role in defining English national identity at a crucial period of global expansion. Its set of texts on the Middle East and South Asia offer a comprehensive and fascinating range of largely unexamined material. They contain some of the earliest documents about Anglo-Ottoman trade, the pre-history of the East India Company, and glimpses into early English perception of these nations. Their significance lies also in the fact that English dealings with these parts of the 'Old World' often formed the template for international negotiations elsewhere.

Despite its impact, Hakluyt's collection is a much overlooked resource. Some of its texts have fared better than others. Individual extracts appear scattered in anthologies (e.g. Andrew Hadfield's Amazons, Savages and Machiavels, 2001), and the American voyages in particular have attracted understandable attention (e.g. Peter Mancall's Hakluyt's Promise, 2007). However, no scholarly annotated editions of the Middle Eastern and South Asian material in The Principal Navigations are available. There are two 19th century complete editions (Woodfall for Robert Harding Evans, 1809-12; Goldsmid, 1884-90). Two more versions appeared in the 20th century (MacLehose &amp;amp; Sons, 1903-5; abridged by Everyman/Dent/Dutton, 1907, repr. 1927). None of these is satisfactory by current standards of editing; none is currently in print. 

This project will produce the first critical edition of the accounts of English travels to the Middle East and South Asia in the Principal Navigations. It will bring together all that is known about the documents' cultural, historical and material contexts, and provide full annotation of places, routes, local inhabitants, maritime terminology and biographical details. As part of the standard library edition of Hakluyt's text, the volume will be a lasting, accessible resource for Hakluyt scholars, cultural historians, geographers, literary scholars and students world-wide. The regional focus will also attract scholars interested in Middle Eastern, South Asian and postcolonial studies, as well as general readers interested in exploration and colonial history. 

More broadly, this research will enhance our knowledge of the intellectual and practical networks that shaped early English interaction with these regions. A further aim is to encourage new research into the movement of information among European and non-European cultures in the period. This will contribute to a research network currently being established by relevant volume editors of the Hakluyt edition. A final aim is to stimulate new understanding of English engagement with these regions in the wider public domain, through planned activities with a number of public institutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The strategic importance of the Middle East and South Asia (particularly countries like Afghanistan and India) invites constant scrutiny and public interest. Taken with the widespread interest in travel, it means that there will be a more general readership for this volume than usually expected for scholarly editions of this nature (Impact: new cultural experience and contribution to knowledge, thus enriching the quality of life of general readers). It is likely that it will attract significant press coverage and sell more widely than many other large editorial projects (Impact: Financial benefit for publishers.)

Other impacts include:

(1) Drawing visitors to libraries and museums, ensuring financial benefits for the institutions and cultural benefits for visitors.

Beneficiaries: Partner institutions in the third sector, namely libraries, museums and galleries

Pathway: A range of post-publication events (2014-2015) are planned, in which I will have organisational, curatorial and advisory roles. Partner institutions include the National Maritime Museum, the Asian and African Studies Department at the British Library, the Walker Art Gallery (Liverpool), the National Library (India) and the John Carter Brown Library (Providence, USA). They are interested in organising more specific curated exhibitions and special guided talks on relevant items in their holdings to coincide with the publication of the volume.

(2) Strengthening international relationship between academics and partner institutions in the UK and abroad

Beneficiaries: Transnational and international organisations

Pathway: The geographical focus on the Middle East and South Asia in this volume makes it likely that it will attract significant international attention and press coverage in the countries in question. I plan to use existing contacts at institutions such as the British Council, the Rhodes Trust and Indian universities, to disseminate research findings through a series of public talks in Kolkata and New Delhi in India. 

(3) Providing contribution to knowledge, skills and quality of life of participants; increasing creative output

Beneficiaries: Theatres and schools through outreach activities

Pathway: This will draw on a collaborative agreement that I established and maintain between my institution and the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse theatres (LEAP). The LEAP Education network is interested in using material from this project in order to explore multiculturalism, toleration and cultural exhange in its member schools in the NW of England. They will use Hakluyt's texts and a play such as Othello for readers' theatre performances and art to instigate discussion among students.

(4) Develop public understanding of cultural heritage 

Beneficiaries: General public, media

Pathway: The BBC History Magazine has offered to commission an article on the OUP Hakluyt edition for publication in due course. The University's Corporate Communications team will support the dissemination of the research outputs by arranging press releases, newspaper articles and radio interviews. Also, my participation in the AHRC media-training workshop (London, July 2011) helped to develop initial plans for a 3-part programme on the earliest English travellers to India, (provisionally titled 'The Priest, the Tourist and the Ambassador'), which I hope to develop further after the completion of the Fellowship.

(5) Increasing academic productivity, academic standing and recruitment 

Beneficiaries: Academic community and HE institutions.

Pathway: As well as generating further research by scholars in the field, the edition and associated publications will also inform teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This will contribute to HE strategies of internationalisation and recruitment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5AF6181-917C-427C-B501-085DA86F987D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used as a background for contributions to BBC Radio 3 programmes for Free Thinking.
