Advocates for the humanities often try to isolate a single winning argument. At the same time, they are necessarily constrained by the nature of the immediately perceived challenge to the humanities. Helen Small is writing a comparative study of the kinds of defence that have been most influential historically and that still command some conviction now. Her study has a dual purpose: to provide an intellectual genealogy of the lines of defence that have been most influential in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, distinguishing between the arguments and describing each in detail; then to test the validity of each of the arguments for the present day. One concern, throughout, is the difficulty of speaking for 'the humanities' - a term only widely used from the 1940s to designate non-science disciplines. Another is the need to discriminate credible justifications for the receipt of public funds from general claims for the importance of the humanities.
The traditions of defence considered are:
-the claim that the humanities are distinguished by their emphasis on cultural interpretation and evaluation, with an indispensable element of subjectivity. Variants on this claim are found in Arnold, Newman, Mill, Ruskin. It carries widespread conviction, but it often comes attached to other assumptions (not always correct) about disciplinary differences between the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences;
-the claim that the humanities are (in a good sense) uselessness or at a remove from economic use value. As a charge against the humanities, this claim is often sourced to Adam Smith. As a positive claim for them it has a particularly influential version in Arnold's Culture and Anarchy - not just in the content of Arnold's arguments for a liberal culture, but in his sense of what is needed in an authoritative language of defence;
-the argument for the pursuit of happiness. This is probably the least trusted argument for the humanities now, but it has a distinguished history in J. S. Mill's description of how reading Wordsworth rescued him from the mental aridity of a utilitarian education. Alan Ryan is among several modern writers who have sought to revive it as a means of rebalancing excessive emphasis on the critical function of the humanities;
-the most ambitious argument now regularly made for the humanities is that 'democracy needs us'. Its immediate source is the American liberal arts tradition, but it has much longer roots in Socrates' claim to be 'a sort of gadfly, given to the polis'. If it is to work today, the argument needs adapting and modernizing, but there are reasons to be wary of exaggerating the importance of the humanities;
-all the above justifications rest on conviction that the humanities have good effects in the world by their impact on our cultural life, our happiness, our political culture. That consequentialism is attractive if the critic is tasked with demonstrating the humanities' public benefit, but it neglects any special value in the objects studied. 'Intrinsic value' is a notoriously difficult term, but a number of critics remain drawn to it as a means of defending the content of the humanities, as opposed to 'transferable skills' drawn from them.
The concluding part of the project seeks to determine how these distinct strands of argument may work with and against each other situationally. It explores what is required for a defence to go beyond the circumstances that impel it and be more generally persuasive.
Publication of the book (where the arguments can be pursued in detail) will be accompanied by a series of short podcasts, freely available from Oxford University i-Tunes. The podcasts will focus on each of the defences treated in the book, providing accessible discussion of their strengths and weaknesses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Among the primary concerns of this work is to improve the quality of debate between universities and public policy makers about the distinctive contribution of the humanities to the public good. The aim is to increase awareness of the defence of the humanities as an act (and a set of genres) with a long history - most relevantly, the history of defending the place of the humanities in a state funded education, and the separate history of defending their place within a publicly funded university system. Many but not all of the arguments for the value of the humanities that have been most influential since the nineteenth century are claims for public impact: the humanities are seen as improving the quality of our cultural life; or improving the happiness of individuals; or assisting effective debate about values and meanings, and so fostering skills essential to the health of the democracy. I find some aspects of those arguments compelling, though I argue that they cannot be a complete or sufficient defence of the humanities. So, while the research seeks to define credible forms of impact for the humanities, it also draws limits on the viability of this way of thinking about their value.

A comparative approach to arguments for the public value of the humanities is intended to have direct impact on the ways in which we debate this subject not just within the academy but more widely. The intention is to alter for the better the nature of the conversation university leaders have with politicians and civil servants; also the kinds of claims teachers and researchers in the humanities make when they represent themselves to the general public. An important correlative aim is therefore to attempt to correct some of the less accurate default narratives frequently heard from the humanities about the nature and imperatives of the audit culture in which universities, like all public institutions, now operate. Without trying to write the kind of book that would be better written by a social scientists, I wish to cast some of the more hostile accounts of recent changes in the nature of debate over public values in a longer historical context that would prevent implausible claims of the 'it's all down to Margaret Thatcher' variety. This can only be a secondary concern of the book, since it is beyond my remit and my expertise to produce the kind of detailed historical account of changes in the nature of public administration that lie behind the rise of the audit culture. Nevertheless, it should be possible to do enough along the way to indicate the weakness of some of the complaints regularly heard about the changes in our political culture that have often made accounts of our work in the humanities look strange to ourselves. 

The combination of monograph publication with recorded podcasts on Oxford University i-Tunes (see http://itunes.ox.ac.uk/) should enable easy access to this work and maximize its audience. A direct means to attracting the attention of policy makers can be taken by advertising the work in Oxford University's annual publication Oxford in Westminster. I am currently giving a series of lectures around the UK and the US (to date: York, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Reading, London; and, in the States, Chicago, New York, and Rutgers, New Jersey) testing draft versions of the argument, and helping to build a ready reception for the finished work. I am also looking to organise a workshop in the later stages of the writing of the monograph, ideally under the auspices of the AHRC, as an occasion to test the claims for the validity of the book's arguments on those who have need of such arguments, and who have to assess their plausibility with a view to public policy making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79592</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Amsterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with academics across Europe in setting up a new journal, History of Humanities, and organising the only regular international conference on this subject.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E14E51F6-8922-4CB8-99E8-9A8D01362DA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Journal.

(An advance copy of the Introduction was sent to the AHRC (to Philip Pothen) in September 2013.) The podcasts of the accompanying lecture series were published in advance on Oxford iTunes (released 13 May 2013), accompanied by an introductory interview titled 'Challenging the Canon'. To date they have been downloaded 29,289 times. At this stage, Oxford IT Services cannot report on individual episode statistics (that data is inaccessible due to Apple constraints). The actual impact of the series is higher than the download figure indicates: for example, the figure does not include the number of times the episode has been streamed on iTunesU instead of downloading the file. Additionally the series has an important web presence on podcasts.ox.ac.uk and is accessible by other university platforms such as Weblearn. The 'Value of the Humanities' series is the number one result on Google for value of humanities podcasts, number 7 for 'value of humanities' and the number two result for 'humanities podcasts'. The audit culture aspect of the research was published as 'Fully Accountable', New Literary History 45 (2014), 539-60. Further podcasts were recorded at Dublin, NYU, Canberra-uploaded on Youtube and on their institutional sites. *Impact* The case made for the public value of the humanities was picked up in advance of the book's publication. Early notice came from the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (an international consortium, led from the U.S.), who asked me to give a plenary lecture to their annual meeting in 2013 (25-27 April); see http://chcinetwork.org/2013-annual-meeting/ As a direct result of that address to heads of humanities institutes from around the world, and representatives from European and US funding bodies, I was asked to deliver a lecture on 'The Humanities and the Public Good' before the EU Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, M&amp;aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, at the Irish Royal Academy on 7 May 2013. On both occasions my function was to articulate a positive account of the distinct ways in which the Humanities have value for us as individuals, as a society and a public culture-providing arguments, without special pleading or undue defensiveness, that can assist others tasked with making the case for public (in the U.S. case, also private) funding of humanities research. The Dublin lecture is one of several versions of the summary lecture, or what Americans would call 'the book talk'. subsequently made available on Youtube. Anecdotally, I understand that the definition given of the distinctive nature of work in the humanities has been taken up institutionally (Jim Chandler, Director of the Franke Institute for the Humanities, University of Chicago, requested a copy of the text for use there). From the point of publication The Value of the Humanities has had considerable uptake within the HE sector, in Britain and internationally. It was the subject of a profile article by Matthew Reisz in Times Higher Education, 26 September 2013. Reisz gave a sympathetic account of the book's attempt to redirect the public conversation about the humanities away from assumptions of crisis and defensiveness, and of the positive case made for contributions to the public good ('Helen Small discusses The Value of the Humanities', http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/helen-s mall-discusses-the-value-of-the-humanities/2007622 .article). This article has for many months now been the top result generated by a google search on 'value humanities'. The book garnered further attention via the THE in December, when the Minister for Universities, the Rt Hon David Willetts, named it one of his books of the year, welcoming it as 'a lucid summary of the case for the humanities that avoids the victim complex that is the bane of such discussions' ('Times Higher Education's Books for 2013', 19 December 2013). He gave it additional notice in a piece for THE on the case for expansion of the Higher Education sector: 'The good news is that these disciplines are themselves getting much better at defining their tremendous public value. Helen Small's book, The Value of the Humanities, is the latest to explore these different sorts of merit, from holding democracy to account to improving our understanding of what makes us happy. And of course, we understand that this value must be measured in wider human as well as purely economic terms' (2 January 2014). I was subsequently invited to appear alongside David Willetts as part of a panel of speakers addressing 'The Future of the Humanities in the UK'. This seminar, organized by the Ax:son Johnson Foundation and held at the British Academy on 19 March 2014, was the first in a series on the State of the Arts running through 2014. (Attendees included Geoffrey Crossick, Director of the AHRC Cultural Value programme.) I spoke, at the organizers' request, about the audit culture of universities, as it affects the Humanities, drawing on my experience of leading the REF Impact return for the Oxford Faculty of English. This aspect of the Humanities work, referred to in the Impact Summary for the grant proposal, was published in New Literary History in 2014; a shorter version will appear in the Ax:son Johnson Foundation's seminar proceedings. A further indication of the interest generated in the early months is that Inside Higher Education requested a Q&amp;amp;A interview on The Value of the Humanities. This was published in on 28 April 2014. It gives perhaps the most immediately accessible, informal account of the thinking behind the book, and has attracted some substantive online discussion. See https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/28/new -book-explores-various-arguments-value-humanities A talk on the book was organized by OUP as a 'launch' event held at Blackwell's Bookshop in Oxford on 15 October 2013, attracting a capacity audience of around 100. (A review piece can be found in http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/a-new-voice-in-def ence-of-the-humanities/) The newly launched Oxford Research Centre for the Humanities (TORCH) made The Value of the Humanities the subject of the opening seminar in its inaugural series, Humanities and the Public Good (2013-14). In a lunchtime seminar on 28 January 2014, entitled 'What's Wrong and What's Right with the Standard Defences for the Humanities', I discussed the book's arguments in conversation with Chris Newfield (Santa Barbara), Isobel Armstrong (Emeritus Professor, Birkbeck) and Michael Levenson (Director of the Institute of Humanities and Global Cultures, University of Charlottesville) (capacity audience, c. 50 people). At the instigation of Dennis B. Klein, at Kean University, New York. I gave a webinar in the series 'The Quest for Humanities in Uncertain Times', on 24 March 2014, which can be viewed at http://www.torch.ox.ac.uk/webinar-value-humanities (the series is now co-sponsored by TORCH). I have spoken about the value of the humanities at numerous venues internationally, including Charlottesville, Virginia (April 2012), New Delhi, India (August 2012), Nanjing, China (May 2013), New York University (5 February 2014), KU Leuven (12 March 2014), the Humanities Research Centre at ANU, Canberra, Australia (who organized a two-day conference in response to the book, audience c. 150), University of Uppsala (2 June 2015), University of Oslo (October 2015), University of Geneva (17 December 2015), University of Pittsburgh (January 2016). Three of these events (Charlottesville, New Delhi, Nanjing) were part of an ongoing Global Humanities Initiative, aimed at improving understanding of the distinctive cultural and political situations of work in the Humanities beyond the UK and US (which have tended to dominate the international political debate so far). I was a co-organiser of the most recent event, a linked conference hosted by Oxford and SOAS. See http://www.virginia.edu/humanities/about/ghi/ I gave the opening lecture at the 'Making of the Humanities' conference in Rome in 2014 (organized by Rens Bod). See http://www.knir.it/en/component/ohanah/conference- qthe-making-of-the-humanities-ivq.html and now serve on the board of a new journal The History of the Humanities. I have recently been invited to act as an external advisor to the Norwegian Research Council. In summary, I hope it is fair to say that the book has had a positive effect on perceptions of the Humanities within Whitehall and well beyond, and that it has had particular benefits for those advocating for the humanities-clarifying the terms of argument, and sharpening understanding of when and how particular arguments can be credible.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CADBEE28-0E42-4993-9142-05BC604EE8DF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54200b8737a6f5.31439924</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The book and associated podcasts and interviews provide a critical account of the principal arguments used to defend the value of the Humanities. The claims considered are: that the Humanities study the meaning-making practices of culture, and bring to their work a distinctive understanding of what constitutes knowledge and understanding; that, though useful to society in many ways (which I detail), they remain significantly at odds with, or at a remove from, instrumental use value; that they contribute to human happiness; that they are a force for democracy; and that they are a good in themselves, to be valued 'for their own sake'. Engaging closely with contemporary literary and philosophical work in the field from the UK and US, I distinguish between arguments that retain strong Victorian roots (Mill on happiness; Arnold on use value) and those that have developed or been substantially altered since. It is important to emphasize that, unlike many works in this field, The Value of the Humanities is not a polemic or a manifesto. The purpose is to explore the grounds for the standard arguments on behalf of the Humanities, and to test their validity for the present day. The book aims to sharpen the terms of the current debate, and to counter perceptions that advocacy for the humanities too often amounts to self-aggrandizement or special pleading.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The definition of the humanities given in Chapter 1 is, I hope, directly employable for the purposes of describing humanities scholarship in general terms. (I give a basic definition, and-at the end of the chapter-also a more forceful definition of the kind that may be needed if the Humanities are subject to unsympathetic pressures to defend their value.) The clarifications for each of the arguments are likely to be useful when and if the relevant kind of justification is in the frame: i.e., the arguments for instrumental usefulness, for contributions to happiness, for benefits to the democratic polity, and for instrumental value (or, as I prefer to express it, the humanities having value for their own sake). The Conclusion of the book treats the harder question of how their value should be weighed against the value of other public goods. These closing pages are, in effect, a clarification of what it means to compare incommensurable goods. Given that policy makers and hard-headed disputants typically see the Humanities as ducking the harder question, I hope this discussion can be a resource for those who might otherwise feel backed into a corner by the baseline claim that, in a situation of diminished public resources where difficult choices have to be made between more research in the Humanities and better equipment for hospitals or the armed forces, the Humanities cannot expect to rank highly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CB4D2843-81F3-4270-BEF1-021542FA9201</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54200c4b387a64.15467430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/04/28/new-book-explores-various-arguments-value-humanities</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>?
