Green supply chain integration and its performance implication</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J016799/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>In recent years firms are under pressure to reduce environmental impacts of their global supply chains. Customers in many developed countries intend to accuse or boycott firms lacking environmental responsibility if their developing-country supply chain partners are convicted of causing environmental damage.This has triggered the needs for suppliers and customers to coordinate environmental management practices.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research proposes a novel concept for environmental collaboration among suppliers and customers.The new concept, called ?green supply chain integration?, involves the strategic collaboration of partner firms in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities by coordinating the intra- and inter-organisational processes.This concept extends the concept of environmental collaboration by integrating environmental management systems across a supply chain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research is anticipated to identify effective practices of green supply chain integration that can simultaneously improve operational and environmental performance of firms from developing and developed countries. It contributes to the understanding of policy issues and helps to reframe debates surrounding the adverse effects of the environmental regulation differences between developed and developing countries.The outcomes of this research help to advance knowledge on environmental collaboration and sustainability within the business and management discipline.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research helps firms in the UK, HK/China and Thailand to create and improve action plans for coordinating environmental management to achieving sustainable environmental and operational performance, leading to less pollution and adverse environmental impact and therefore improving the quality of life of the involved communities. To achieve this impact, the project website will continuously inform and update interested parties, including business managers and policy makers, with key findings of the research via Electronic news (e-news). Wider audience will be reached via regional and national newspapers. Next, several practitioner-friendly papers and industry benchmarking reports will be made available for downloading. These publications and benchmarking reports provide key findings of the research including best practices, lessons learnt, operating models, implementation key success factors and implementation frameworks. The research will publish a practitioner article at the CIPS's Supply Management Magazine. E-news will alert the availability of such publications. The website is open to any interested businesses to download the various papers and reports. Downloading frequency will be traced and reported to measure the extent of the dissemination. The proposed interview, survey and case study will be used to engage with businesses. Each survey respondent will receive a personalized industrial benchmarking report. Two case studies are planned to further explain the survey findings as well as allowing the investigators and case companies to co-develop practical frameworks and action plans to coordinate environmental management. Selected case companies will be asked to share the success and experience with other by giving keynote speeches at the industrial seminar. Relevant businesses, industrial associations, regulatory bodies, academic researchers and management consultants will be invited to participate in the one-day industrial seminars. Copies of policy and industrial benchmarking reports will be distributed to the relevant participants. The industrial seminar allows the investigators and invited case companies to explain the key findings and recommendations to the participants. A break-out discussion session during industrial seminar will allow participants to engage with each other, share best practices, and create opportunity for future collaboration. Management consultants will be able to translate the findings of this research into consultancy frameworks to benefit wider business communities. This research informs policy makers the effects of current environmental policies in encouraging firms from developed and developing countries to jointly reduce environmental impacts of their supply chain. Policy-focus papers based on the survey and case study findings produced by the PIs will be made available for downloading. The policy report provides scientifically rigour analyses to prove its effectiveness of the various ways environmental policies affecting buying firms in communicating, monitoring and collaborating with their suppliers. Relevant policy makers will be invited to participate in the industrial seminar. The purpose of such is to spur further debates and policy improvement. A break-out discussion session during industrial seminar will allow policy makers to discuss policy implications with the related industries. Policy makers from developed and developing countries may take the findings of the research as a basis for harmonizing relevant policies. The business and management research community will benefit from the novel theory of green supply chain integration (GSCI) developed by this research. The research will disseminate the findings of this research mainly through three major conferences - EurOMA, POMS, AOM and three journals - JOM, DSJ/IJOPM and AMJ.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74238</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J016799/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>6E22BC1C-5E63-481E-94FA-09CBE71CD829</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J016799/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>74238.67</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>5E889DE5-25F2-4C00-B302-DCC57DABB28C</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J016799/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>70593.33</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2E2E80C2-8D14-44CE-A971-37A9ACC4B244</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufact.
