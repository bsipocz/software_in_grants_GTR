It is more difficult to convey the sheer size of these bings and the amount of shale they contain to someone who has never seen them. At the height of productionm spent shale was being added to the bings at an annual rate of equivalent of a single bing with a volume almost as great as the Cheops pyramid in Egypt (which is 451 ft high). When production ceased in 1962 there were 27 bings containing over 200 million tons of shale. The ambitious scale of, for example, the adjoining derelict shale bings 'Five Sisters' requires FURTHER research and development in the visual arts, both in its emblematic representation in documentary photographic practices and as a site/position for further art-works addressing the terrain and its historic value.\n\nVisual Context:\n'Five Sisters' speak of landscape histories with which Scotland is not normally associated. Nonetheless they present a typification of Scottish landscape as a place uneasily assessed, yet oddly beautiful in its increasingly industrialised horizons. Their dramatic brick-coloured precipices of the shale are now mostly covered in wild flowers and grasses, inhabited by a variety of birds such as kestrels. Their development within a plateau surrounded by industrialised farmland and business parks (including the nearby redundant Freeport Leisure Village) emphasise their melancholy effects.\n\nPotential Applications and Benefits:\nThe proposed research's potential application and benefit is a reidentification of 'Five Sisters' as a site of art, reaffirmed in its recognition by civic and governmental authority as a place of 'natural' wonder into which other artowrk may come into being.\n\nPreliminary collation of scarce reference material in the visual arts and an analysis of anecdotal evidence on 'Five Sisters' show the site's potential to be (but not sufficiently recognised as) an internationally significant example of British Land Art produced as a result of an Artist Placement Group residency in Scotland and exemplar in Scottish post-war art production. It is therefore imperative that the production of material and data related to this application be archival retrievable (to deposited at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art Archives) for further scholarly research and to be utilised by this applicant in exhibitions which provide public access and exploitation of the relevant visual material. Further practice-based research will involve this applicant's production of photographic and digital video recording of 'Five Sisters' and other shale bings. This will be for use in an exhibition proposal to The Henry Moore Institute in Leeds following a confirmed seminar contribution and short Fellowship taking place late in 2006 and benefiting this proposed research. A short series of magazine articles (2), public lectures (2) and seminars (1) and visual art journal articles (2) would precede and accompany this exhibition. Further beneficiaries would include Tate Britain, as new reference precede and accompany this exhibition. Further beneficiaries would include Tate Britain, as new reference accompanying Latham's work 'Derelict Land Art: Five Sisters' (1976) at Tate for further exhibition purposes would be produced. This includes interview transcriptions from surviving Artist Placement Group member Barbara Stevini and contextualised within a broader definition of Scottish art, landscape</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E503004/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
