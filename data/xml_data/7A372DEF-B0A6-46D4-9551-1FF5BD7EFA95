The effectiveness of the system, integrated with conventional plant protection products, will be tested with a panel of key high value host crops which have major disease problems where standard control measures are inefficient, or under threat due to environmental and regulatory concerns.

approaches into crop protection programmes with the aim of reducing chemical active levels and providing methods of safe disease suppression close to harvest. This research aims to faciltate the entry of a novel crop protection agent, and the engineering system which enables its delivery, to salads and field vegetable production systems.

It will provide them with the opportunity to use a safe crop protection system with zero
residue issues. The impact could be realised as soon as the project finishes, since the application system can be fitted to existing equipment and used without
the need for product registration. Though the system is intended for conventional production, the organic sector could see a particularly significant impact. Policy makers and regulators will also see an immediate impact, as the project will provide a route for the reduction of conventional active ingredients, which may in turn prolong the availability of those actives for use at critical points in the production process. Food processors (eg packers) will benefit as there should be less product
wastage since healthier material arrives from the field. Retailers will benefit through enhanced shelf life and storability and better product appearance. They will face potentially fewer instances of failure to meet minimum residue levels, and will
gain market advantage through the promotion to customers of reduced agrochemical input production systems. Public understanding and acceptance of plant protection systems could be improved. Healthier plants at harvest are more likely to retain levels of compounds beneficial to human health (eg antioxidants, vitamins) for a longer period than plants whichharbour low levels of disease or surface contaminants and which may result in more rapid degradation . Health benefits could be realised in the wider public and in commercial catering.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>372077</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New data on efficacy of this product for effective plant disease control</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Commercial exploitation by project partners</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>23B97AA6-5075-410B-A4AB-4F20B5901511</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d0255cea2b92.09112620</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M00547X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
