Several governments have therefore tried, albeit with varied success, to liberalise their employment laws in order to meet the Lisbon employment targets. This project examines such efforts in the EU?s new member states and accession countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC10+Croatia). The aim is to understand not only the causes of national variation in EPL strictness and their consequences for employment, but also the dynamics of EPL reforms over time and conditions that make these politically difficult reforms viable. To this end, the project will develop a comparative database of EPL reforms documenting annual changes in employment protection since 1990, and political and economic factors associated with these reforms. To examine whether there may be more than one recipe for good/bad employment performance, statistical analysis and standard regression techniques will be combined with state-of-the-art qualitative methods in the form of crisp-set and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). By recognising that poor employment performance may not have the same causes in all countries, this analysis may provide evidence against one-size-fits-all policy recommendations, which often wrongly assume that what works in one country will work everywhere.

The first is an analysis of the impact of EPL (employment protection legislation) and other labour market institutions on employment performance. This part of the project has resulted in two papers, one focusing on aggregate unemployment and the other on youth unemployment in the EU and OECD countries during the last three decades. Neither paper finds systematic support for the conventional view that unemployment is a consequence of rigid labour market institutions. The evidence is particularly weak if we consider only the direct effects of individual institutions. While we found some indications that certain institutional interactions may be important (such as between the tax wedge on the one hand, and unemployment benefits and employment protection on the other), this evidence is not unambiguously clear. Our analysis therefore challenges the policy orthodoxy that comprehensive labour market deregulation is necessary to reduce or stabilise unemployment. Calls for further labour market deregulation seem to be especially unwarranted in CEECs (Central and Eastern Europe), where the link between institutions and unemployment appears particularly weak. But even in the advanced economies the effects of institutions are weak and in most cases depend heavily on which countries are included in the analysis. The most plausible interpretation of these results is that institutions have different effects in different contexts, and that therefore there is no universal cause of (and remedy for) unemployment. An implication of this for further research is that in-depth analyses of individual countries or particular groups of countries may be more fruitful in offering sound policy recommendations than the continued search for universal causes of unemployment.



The second part of the project examines why some governments adopt unpopular reforms entailing far-reaching liberalisation of the labour market, while others opt only for marginal adjustments or even regulatory reforms. Focusing on EPL reforms in 24 EU countries during 1990-2007, the analysis shows that the likelihood of different types of reform is an effect of different constellations of government partisanship and veto players. Combining the 'blame avoidance' and 'veto players' logics of politics, the analysis demonstrates that veto players have either a constraining or enabling effect depending on the partisan orientation of government. Correspondingly, liberalisation is pursued either by right parties facing few veto players, or by left parties in contexts with a high degree of power sharing. Regulatory reforms are most likely when left governments enjoy strong power concentration, but marginal regulation may be also adopted under external (ie EU) pressure by right governments facing many veto players. 



The third part of the analysis examines the reasons behind cross-national variation in the strictness of EPL in CEECs. This analysis is still undergoing, but some preliminary findings suggest that there may be two different paths to high levels of employment protection, one involving strong labour movements and few veto players, and the other weak governments and a high degree of non-market coordination.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BAB6014-BC96-4F02-BE99-4E347A213727</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9527140780.842995b2f0e1ca</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This qualitative database provides an inventory of all employment protection reforms adopted in Central and Eastern European countries during 1990-2009.
