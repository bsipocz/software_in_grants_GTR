Our biofilm based biofilter is a new and novel solution to pool water filtration. By using beneficial biofilms it negates chemical disinfection, enables complete control of algae and algal films, and recent preliminary data has shown the potential for management of key aquatic pathogens. 

The swimming pool filtration market (worth 3.2bn) currently lacks chemical-free alternatives despite customers' demands of healthier, easier and cheaper solutions to pool water treatment. Therefore a unique market oportunity exists. The benefits of biofiltration over the incumbent (chemical) filters are: 1. Higher reliability potential (less reliance on chemical testing /dosing ), 2. Lower maintenance (no monitoring of water chemistry), 3. Cost savings: Zero chemical usage, lower circulation energy (120w vs 1200w circulation pumps) 4. Enhanced user experiences (fresh vs chemical laden water). This project would help to fully realise the mass market potential for this biofilm based technology, through innovative and robust scientific research and development. 

This project will assess and develop the potential for beneficial biofilms to control pathogens through understanding and optimising biofilm performance. To this end, we will utilise novel scientific techniques, e.g. bioluminescent bacterial reporters (enabling temporal and spatial monitoring of known pathogens), to gain new scientific insights and knowledge in this area where research is currently lacking. Whilst the vast majority of aquatic biofilm research tends to focus on the widesperad elimination of biofilms (which are seen as a health threat), we have already proved that biofilm based biofilters in swimming pools can successfully control algae-sustaining nutrients (P and N). 

This study seeks to answer the following research questions:

1) To what extent do beneficial biofilms grown on biofilters (CWR biofiltration system) reduce the levels of known waterborne pathogens in freshwater? 
2) Does the CWR biofiltration system prevent the re-introduction of pathogens in water? 
3) How can the beneficial biofilm within the CWR biofiltration system be optimised to maximise pathogen removal? 

This 12 month feasibility project brings together scientists from the University of the West of England and Bristol based business entrepreneurs, Clear Water Revival Ltd. (CWR) who specialise in the development and production of chemical free swimming pools. A laboratory phase will be used to inform real-world testing on full scale biofilters fitted to full size swimming pools thereby providing direct, tangible and immediate technology benefit/s from applied scientific research and discovery. 

The successful completion of this project would help to fully realise the mass market potential for this biofilm based technology, through innovative and robust scientific research and development. It will help place the UK at the forefront of chemical free water treatment, ultimately improving quality of life, reducing environmental impact whilst generating wealth creation opportunities for the UK leading to the creation and securing of jobs.

The proposed scientific research has many cross sector applications, since the fundamental aim is to understand and encourage beneficial biofilms which can sanitise water; as a healthy alternative to using harmful chemicals. While the practical application will focus on bio-filters for pools, the scientific knowledge gained would also be highly applicable to all aquatic pathogens, and in particular, waste water treatment, contaminated water remediation and intensive fish farming.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This is a joint project between Clear Water Revival Ltd and the University of the West of England, Bristol. Clear Water Revival Ltd has been creating Natural Swimming Pools in the UK for 8 years. UWE and Clear Water Revival will develop a novel bio filter system that uses natural biological action (biofilms) to manage water quality. Specifically we will develop and optimise a new biofilm bio filtration technology platform for management of key waterborne pathogens within natural swimming pool environments. Six interconnected work packages (WP) correlate with the main study objectives. (1) To determine and quantify the efficiency of pathogen removal using biofilms developed on an existing CWR bio media substrate [WP2]. (2) To develop the performance of the biofilm (developed in WP2) by optimising the biofilm formation within the bio media, enabling efficient pathogen removal [WP3]. (3) To assess and observe the extent to which pathogens are capable of residing, propagating and dispersing from biofilms contained within the optimised CWR bio filtration system [WP4]. (4) To implement full scale, real world testing of the optimised bio media and physicochemical parameters for optimal biofilm performance within full scale bio filters for swimming pools, and to validate and quantify pathogen removal using these systems [WP5]. [WP6] will focus on the Dissemination and Exploitation Strategy (months 1-12); We will drive the developed bio filtration technology platform through to commercialisation via exploitation and implementation. A key challenge will be to improve our understanding of how pathogenic bacteria physically interact with the biofilm/bio media, in particular whether the biofilm acts as a sink or a reservoir for potentially harmful bacteria.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The global swimming pool market is estimated to be worth over &amp;pound;3 billion. The project seeks to address the specific challenge of using beneficial biofilms to reliably control aquatic pathogens, and by doing so potentially provides a new, innovative (low energy and chemical free) technology solution to the treatment of swimming pool water. The project 's objectives assess and develop the potential for biofilms to control pathogens through understanding and optimising biofilm performance. To this end, we will utilise novel scientific techniques such as bioluminescence (which visually detects and monitors specific bacterial and bacterial biofilm metabolic behaviour) to gain new scientific insights and knowledge in this area where research is currently lacking. Whilst the vast majority of aquatic biofilm research tends to focus on the widespread elimination of biofilms (which are seen as a health threat), we have already proved that biofilms do successfully control algae-causing nutrients (P and N) . This project aims to investigate and demonstrate biofilm management strategies for the potential to control pathogens with high degrees of reliability and repeatability. We will show proof-of-concept of our main ideas; to build a biofilm based filter for the management and control of waterborne pathogens in swimming pools. We will develop a bio-filter representing a new and novel solution to pool water quality control. By using beneficial biofilms the ultimate aim of this project is to remove the need for chemical disinfection all together. If this was realised then significant reductions in energy use (required for water circulation) could also be achieved along with enhanced user experience (zero chemicals) and lower maintenance levels (no chemical dosing/monitoring). 

The project will bring together biological sciences and technologists driving forward the use of basic science to develop biological based and inspired tools that can improve the quality of life and econmic prosperity in the U.K. These are key drivers for both the BBSRC and Innovate UK.

The work will have immediate impact on (1) scientists and technologists interested in the use and management of biofilms, (2) environmental scientists and engineers and those interested water treatment technologies and processes. This application and it's objectives are well aligned with the competition scope as demonstrated below: 
 
The potential for biofilms to remove and control pathogens involves numerous management factors including optimised water flow rate over the biofilm, the make up of biofilm growth substrate (including porosity and pore size), pH, temperature and nutrient levels present. The project seeks to specifically understand and exploit these key techniques and processes, and to optimise beneficial biofilm performance, in order to specifically maximise efficiency and reliability with regard to pathogen control. 
 
The translation of knowledge of model biofilm systems into technology, tools and techniques with broad, generic or cross sector potential. Lab studies will be used to inform real life testing on full-scale bio-filters during the course of the project thereby providing direct, tangible and immediate technology benefit/s from applied scientific research and discovery. 
The proposed scientific research has many cross sector applications, since the fundamental aim is to understand and encourage beneficial bio-films which can sanitise water; as a healthy alternative to using harmful chemicals. While the practical application will focus on bio-filters for pools, the scientific knowledge gained would also be highly applicable to all aquatic pathogens, and in particular, waste water treatment, contaminated water remediation and intensive fish farming.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35084</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Clear Water Revival Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Clear Water Revival Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BAC9AB2-097F-455F-84F4-609F188EFD24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The employment of two UWE graduates by CWR.

Economic Impact:

The results from the project underpin biological filtration technology from a safety perspective. Proving that natural filter systems are safe (and control pathogens) is an essential to greater uptake of this technology and market penetration. We expect the results of the project to have the following impacts:

- Creation of 5 new jobs between 2017 - 2019

- Establishment of longer term research in this area with additional private sector investment of &amp;pound;100,000

- Increasing of sales revenue from &amp;pound;1m to &amp;pound;5m over 3 years due to increased consumer confidence

- Increase of bio-filtration market share from current chemical based technologies

 
Societal Impacts:

- Reduction in the use of chemicals which are harmful to human health

- Demonstration of how natural processes can contr0l pathogens

- Potential applications in the sanitization of drinking water in third world counties</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>55F86E32-06E8-4490-871D-D10C9469E582</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c92f28092ce0.96679448</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research have helped developed a biofiltration system (using biofilms) that have a high level of reliability, low running costs, ease of maintenance to ensure the best possible performance at all times. For the first time, it is now possible to achieve all the benefits of a formal, heated traditional (chlorinated) pool, with the added benefit of a freshwater swimming environment, whilst saving thousands per year in running costs (no chemical disinfection required). Our research has shown that efficient control of nutrients, through the deployment of biofilm technology which relies on microbial action rather than chemicals or plants, is possible. This enables &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; pools to be built indoors or outside, with or without plants and allows for the water to be heated up to 30 degrees.

Key Discoveries and Findings
? We have developed a laboratory scale bio-filter model system for the testing and evaluation of biofilm biofiltration systems. These systems have the advantage that they can be arranged and configured in a range of geometries with a view for informing the manufacture and production of optimized systems for use in the real-world.
? We have discovered that biofilms can be used to manage and control nutrients to a level that inhibits pathogen survival within the bulk water.
? We have developed a novel multi-pass through-flow model system that enables the quantification of pathogen removal via bio-filtration.
 

The key success factor in any natural swimming pool or swimming pond, is the ability to have complete and continual control of nutrient levels (specifically Nitrogen and Phosphorous) in the water at all times to ensure that they remain undetectable. This, in turn can be used to also control waterborne pathogens without the need for chemical disinfection or sterilization.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>CWR provide the only natural swimming pool company in Europe who have taken a ground up, scientific approach to developing a natural filtration system for private and commercial swimming pools and are the only UK company with an in-house developed natural filtration system.

The pools will be the first ever to use special microbiological filters to keep water clean without the use of traditional chemicals.
