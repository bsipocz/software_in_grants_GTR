Growth is a defining property of living organisms including humans. How fast we grow and to what size we grow are both influenced by both external factors such as the quality of our diet and by internal factors. Growth problems can cause serious disease in themselves and may underlie increased susceptibility to other problems such as heart disease. 
We have found that changes in a particular gene alter both the growth rate and size of the animal. This gene codes for part of the network of proteins that allow animals to transmit messages within cells using the simple molecule calcium. This signalling network is one of the most common and important signalling systems in animals and humans. Our aim is to discover how this system regulates growth by identifying which other genes are involved and where in the animal (in which cells or tissues) it acts. 
Using C. elegans will allow us to use state-of-the art genetic approaches on a large scale so that we can simultaneously test a large number of ideas about how the system might work and identify new components of the system. 
By doing this we will increase our understanding of growth regulation which in turn should help us to ensure that diseases caused by alterations in growth can be treated more effectively and that people can grow healthily.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Growth is a defining characteristic of life. A range of disease syndromes are associated with growth defects and abnormal growth patterns may compromise health in later life, for example growth rate may influence susceptibility to cardiac disease. In humans and other animals growth is determined by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Much remains unknown about the nature of these intrinsic factors and of how they interact with external factors.

Our overall goal is to use the nematode C. elegans as a model system, to address the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated signalling in the regulation of growth. IP3 is produced in response to the activation of cell surface receptors by a wide range of stimuli. IP3 activates the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and causes intracellular calcium release thus regulating gene expression and cell physiology. 

We have now shown mutants in the IP3R receptor (itr-1) in C. elegans have reduced growth rate, reduced size and alterations in life span. Our overall aim is to identify components of the molecular mechanism that regulates growth through itr-1. 

Objectives:
1. Test for interactions with pathways known to regulate aspects of growth e.g. insulin signalling and clock genes
2. Identify new genes that interact with IP3 signalling to regulate growth
3. Identify the site of itr-1 action in growth regulation- by cell and tissue specific rescue.
4. Test and define other effects of itr-1 on growth related events- in particular developmental timing and ageing

Objectives 1 and 2 will be addressed primarily by using an RNAi screen. We will select approximately 2000 genes and test by RNAi whether they improve or further reduce the growth rate of itr-1 mutants. These genes will include genes from classes that have previously been suggested to regulate growth and others. To complement this approach we will map and clone mutants that suppress the growth defect in itr-1. Having identified such genes we will address their interactions with itr-1.

By doing these experiments we will identify signalling mechanisms centred on IP3 signalling that control growth rate. The molecular nature of this mechanism will also help clarify the physiological nature of the mechanism (i.e is it cellular, hormonal etc). The role of such a fundamental pathway in the regulation of growth and associated processes is of substantial importance to our understanding of growth in all animals, including humans.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>305716</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B6097EC-7166-4868-ADDE-F8C1C7EC55C4</gtr:id><gtr:title>IP3 signalling regulates exogenous RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>EMBO reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/059124844154f5d8b99a0488464dec92"><gtr:id>059124844154f5d8b99a0488464dec92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nagy AI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1469-221X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675ded45345c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0601106</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
