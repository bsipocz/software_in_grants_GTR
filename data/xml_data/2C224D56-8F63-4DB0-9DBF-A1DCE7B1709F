During the pilot project, the co-investigators worked with BBC West to support journalists in developing stories for the project. We were then funded (AH/M50418X/1) to work with BBC South West in a similar role, as well as continuing to work with our original partner. Finally, we were funded to work on the project in a national role (AH/M504178/1) supporting BBC Nations and English Regions, as well as the central team in New Broadcasting House.

Our role in working with the BBC was very varied, but included: 
* Providing academic rigour to the research underpinning stories and to the stories themselves
* Fact-checking and reviewing stories before broadcast
* Suggesting stories to the journalists
* Suggesting contacts to the journalists
* Providing historical context to the stories
* Providing live and recorded interviews
* Attending BBC Road-shows and providing assistance as required to the BBC and members of the public
* Acting and historical consultants to the editors of the project e-book (see publications)
* In general acting as critical friends for the journalists and their managers</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bristol Cultural Development Partnership</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bristol 2014</gtr:description><gtr:id>344C37FC-6B47-47C0-B3AF-085C45FE792A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public engagement with local history and heritage connected to the First World War</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df15f6f407f6.79887011-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Bristol Cultural Development Partnership developed and delivered the successful funding bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund, enabling the &amp;quot;Moved by Conflict&amp;quot; exhibition (Bristol Museums Galleries and Archives - see other Collaborations and Partnerships page), and many other activities and events across the city - see project website below</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The co-investigators (Booth and Fedorowich) served on the advisory committee of the HLF-funded Bristol 2014 project, organised and led by the Bristol Cultural Development Partnership

BBC audience research on their WW1 coverage has concluded that:
* By September 2014, over half over the people who consumed BBC content had a fair understanding of the events of WW1. 
* Awareness of local impact was low at the end of 2013, but grew in 2014. 
* There is an audience appetite for more WW1 content. In June 2015, the majority of the audience agreed they had seen just the right amount of WW1 content, indicating they do not feel any fatigue. Far more agree there has been 'too little' rather than 'too much' WW1 content. 
* In June 2015, 51% of the UK public said they 'would like to know more about WW1', showing interest in this area remains strong.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01c1c543eb7.58470984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC World War One at Home Live Events and Roadshows</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CB0B6F8-A7E1-4B4A-BE95-FAC91BF51874</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the World War One at Home project, the BBC organised and delivered a number of Roadshows and other live events.
