These include volunteering to make communities better places. A core idea in recent thinking in behavioural economics and the study of collective action is that the way information is presented to citizens matters to their willingness to donate their time. This can include who makes the request, what information there is about what other people do, and what feedback people get about their volunteering and the activities of others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research is particularly interested in whether recommendations from prominent people, such as those in the community sector and politicians, can help promote civic action. The researchers want to know whether varying the form of feedback to citizens matters. Using randomized controlled trials, the researchers will investigate contributions to time-banks and student volunteering.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will first recruit new volunteers and vary randomly the kind of request. Once participants start to volunteer, it will feed back information about how well they are doing in different ways to find out the impact on their participation and volunteering in local communities.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research include the scientific communities interested in the provision of social information on collective goods, especially political scientists, economists and urban scholars, but there are several important groups of beneficiaries in the wider community. The beneficiaries outside the scientific communities are 1) policy-makers in UK central government, and in the devolved administrations, who are formulating policies to encourage greater involvement on the part of the citizens in making more contributions to public goods. We include here policy-makers in the Cabinet Office charged with promoting greater involvement, such as the Behavioural Insights Team (through David Halpern), and the Office for Civil Society. 2) We include national organisations that are responsible for encouraging volunteering and community action. We are working with Volunteering England, through its senior policy manager Mike Locke, which is interested in both our work stimulating volunteering for young people, and also our work on community action through Timebanks. We are working closely with NESTA - National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts - which is interested in promoting innovation in delivering citizen-based policies, and has particular remit for timebanks, and our contact is Dan James, Policy Manager. 3) Local government and locally based voluntary organisations. A range of bodies are responsible for encourage voluntary activities, such as local government, local voluntary bodies and charities, and other public organisations, such as universities. These bodies will be able to vary the institutional design elements of their organistions, which can vary how social information is conveyed to citizens, such as feedback, form of requests. The organisations will be able to learn practical results from our research and apply them their our own policies and research.

The means whereby the research will contribute to impact will be through the advisory group, contacts of the research, a twitter feed, findings put on our website, a final event in London where will invite policy makers.

Such work will enhance the impact on the increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy because of the greater focus on citizen-lead form of service delivery, which is more appropriate in times of fiscal austerity, and also when governments of all hues are seeking to get better leverage on society problems which need a citizen input as much as the involvement of professional bureaucracies.

Some of the benefits will happen during the research as the findings emerge, the rest will emerge after the main findings have been produced and disseminated. All the above impacts are consistent with the ESRC's influencing behaviour and informing interventions strategic priority, which is a key part of the current refined list of strategic priorities for the funding body. 

The researchers will develop practical skills in delivering experiments which adds to the capacity of the UK to carry out this kind of method. The focus on concrete instances of the application of institutions through experimental intervention is expected to lead to direct impacts on contribution outcomes as a consequence of the research. The method allows the effect size of these impacts to be assessed such that this knowledge will enable further impact through the application of the institutions in other contexts. 

Finally, the citizens themselves will benefit from being able to contribute and from being encourage to do so, as one of the problems in collective action is the individuals desired to participate but lack incentives and the supportive context in which to do so.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>401310</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Overview: we have had a range of impacts, which started first from the organisations with whom we collaborated; then was extended to other voluntary organisations interested in the research and to central and local policy-makers who are concerned with behavioural insights and volunteering. Members of the research team have been disseminating the findings with practitioners in their own communities and contacts.

Overall, dissemination focused on three sets of issues. The first is about why we had null results from the trials and what this says about the role of behavioural insights in volunteering, whether there are limits to nudge or just that one kind of nudge did not work in this case. The second is about the learning experience of delivering a behavioural trial in the organisational context of a voluntary body: the challenges involved and the knowledge about how to solve them. The third is insights from our practical engagement with current issues, such as with delivering citizen science.

We start with some examples of learning and transfer with our partners. The student volunteering unit at UCL notified us that they had changed their systems for recruiting volunteers following involvement in our research, which involves sending out email at the same time as we did ours. The unit was impressed with how many students came forward at the early part of term and believed that the e-mail notification was useful in recruiting new sets of students to consider volunteering. Student Hubs found the work useful and we intend to follow up during the year. Similarly, the National Trust found our work interesting and will use the findings. 

One of our partners, Family Mosaic, used the two 'sister' citizen social science projects we ran jointly as part of the evidence base for their review of their customer engagement strategy. It proposed a radically different model of how this social landlord engages with its tenants and residents: http://www.familymosaic.co.uk/news-article/297/index.html and the results of this review were then shared with a further 22 housing associations in London and the SE. The report Changing Focus: a new model of resident involvement, published by Family Mosaic in August 2016 includes the following reflections on the research for the organisation:
'So where does this leave us? One suggestion is we need to do more than just nudge people if we want to change their behaviour. We need nudge plus something else. Nudge can generate interest but to translate this into action we need to employ think tactics, for example, having informed discussions' (p.18).

Our partners, the chief executives of the Associations of Local Councils, with whom we worked with to deliver the experiment to increase parish-level participation, found the exercise valuable, as it informed them about the barriers and opportunities for participation, as found out by our pilot and survey results. The chief executive of the Hampshire CALC, Stephen Lugg said: 'For us, the value of the ESRC Project was both ''in the journey of learning but also in the results. Human nature is complex and rarely able to be accurately predicted, but that does not mean we should stop exploring!'
 
Moving beyond our project, we communicated and discussed our project findings with participants at our end of project impact event held at The Bond in Birmingham on the 19th November 2015. The event was facilitated by Ben Lee from the National Association of Neighbourhood Management, and was chaired by Justin Davis-Smith then of NCVO. Sixty people, mainly from the voluntary sector, attended the event, where they heard presentations from the research team on each project and discussed the findings. They found it an interesting and valuable exercise, ticking either good or excellent in their evaluation forms. A number of them mentioned they would use field experiments (e.g. Essex Students Union) or citizen science. Comments from the evaluation forms included: &amp;quot;hope to use citizen science as a way of further engaging NCS graduates&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;won't send emails to help increase volunteering!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;research more, try to gain better strategies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;would like to conduct some form of citizen science with our client base to improve services&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;letting volunteers know the part they've played in the bigger picture&amp;quot;. We collected comments during the day from Twitter into a Storify https://storify.com/BenYMLee/giving-time-can-volunteers-be-nudged. We produced a link for attendees to access and share our presentations. 

We had queries about the project findings from external organisations and we accordingly sent them our research findings summary. Some of these queries were generated following the publicity for our End of Award impact event. These included: 
1) The London Borough of Havering library services (Jenny Isaac), Transforming Libraries Project who were seeking to use behavioural insights to increase volunteering and time given to volunteering. Sent them our project summary in Nov 2015. 
2) The National Union of Students (Rosie Soffe) who were examining barriers to participation in volunteering, clubs, societies, student fundraising. Sent them our project summary in Nov 2015 which they found useful and they expressed interest in involving us in one of their events in 2016.

Peter John had a meeting with staff at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, such as Justin Davis-Smith, to review the work. NCVO found the work fascinating and still wants to use experiments in future evaluations. A further project using an experiment was discussed with Peter John. Justin got in touch with the charity Step Up to Serve (http://www.iwill.org.uk/about-us/step-up-to-serve/) and a meeting took place on the 6 October 2016 between Peter John, Chief Executive Officer Charlotte Smith and Deputy Chief Executive Officer Rania Marando. Peter John got a chance to explain the research from the Giving Time project, which generated a lot of interest because the charity had already been using behavioural insights and randomised controlled trials with its work with the Behavioural Insights Team, and found the insights from the project useful. The idea is that a follow on project can be designed using behavioural insights.

We have disseminated our results. Third Sector Magazine invited Peter John to write an article called 'Research shows that it's hard to increase volunteering rates', in the issue 25 February 2016, http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/peter-john-research-shows-its-hard-increase-volunteering-rates/article/1384628. 

During the project, Peter John finished his book, Field Experiments in Political Science and Public Policy for Routledge/Taylor and Francis, forthcoming 2017. Though the book is not a direct impact of the project, its focus on the implementation of trials links to the project ambitious aim to using RCTs in new sectors. In fact, several examples of tough implementation decisions from the project appear in the book. Peter John has given several presentations of the book and uses an example from the project (the student volunteering example) to illustrate the 10-steps approach to design and the nine threats to randomised controlled trials to look out for. He presented the book and the project findings to gatherings in Switzerland at University of Lausanne and St Gallen in the first week of December 2014. Peter presented the book's approach on the 9 November 2016 in Utrecht to a gathering of policy-makers, including the director of the Dutch 'nudge unit'. 

Peter John is a member of the ONS Social Capital Steering Group, which advises on social capital indicators and policies, such as on voluntary group membership, which has given him an opportunity to discuss the project with group members. He discussed the project with Ewen Mckinnon at the Cabinet Office, who is head of Analysis and Insight, at the Office for Civil Society. Ewen kindly distributed the findings around his team and got good feedback on the interesting nature of the findings.

Team members participate in events where the project feeds in and influences. Matt Ryan is part of a workshop to the behavioural insights analysts team in BEIS on 25 November 2016. 
Several members of the team (Stoker, Richardson, John, and Ryan) presented ideas linked to the project to about 50 selected senior civil servants across central government departments in a 'speed dating' event to encourage new methods, which was held at the Institute for Government on Thurs 22nd September 2016, including experimental methods and citizen science.

Gerry Stoker made a presentation to HM Treasury Behaviour Change Network, called 'Experiments and Behaviour Change: How far can they go?', on 14 April 2015, which discussed the limits to nudge experiments. He gave a presentation to Indonesia's Ministry for Reform, Nudge and its Future, on 1 May 2016, and a further presentation to Test Valley council on putting Nudge into Practice on 13th August 2015.

Peter John presented ideas on behaviour change from the project in a masterclass run by Sheila McKechnie Foundation (SMK) on 20 September 2016 and was attended by those working in the voluntary sector. 

Matt Ryan did the opening plenary at the Hampshire Associations of Local Councils annual for their chief executive Steve Lugg in St Mary's Stadium in Southampton meeting on the 9th March 2016.

Our work was presented in a keynote speech to over 200 practitioners and policy-makers in Wellington, New Zealand on Friday 4th December 2015, organised by ANZSOG (Australia and New Zealand Society of Government). Feedback from the event was extremely positive for being 'thought provoking' (rated 4.4/5) and 'I learnt something new' (4.4/5), with comments on 'the most important ideas I heard today' including things like:
&amp;middot; I will be asking the nudge question in my own work place context
&amp;middot; The learning via real examples from using Nudge from Liz
&amp;middot; Nudging is a possible way of increasing volunteer participation
&amp;middot; That nudge theory has developed to become nudge plus
&amp;middot; That nudges work best for issues that involve fast thinking

Work on Citizen Science has been influential. Matt Ryan has done work with Southampton City Council on citizen science and have been co-designing behavioural research there during late 2015 and in 2016.
 
Matt Ryan agreed to join the research board of this Project Oracle evaluation hub that are interested in evaluating behaviour change projects in various ways. Peter John is already a member of this board which examines organisations attempts to improve performance.

In Spring/ Summer 2015 Professor Oliver James and Dr Alice Moseley met with managers from the Citizens Advice Bureaux (Devon) on two occasions to disseminate findings from the Giving Time project concerning the use of behavioural techniques in the recruitment of volunteers. Volunteers are crucial to the operations of the CAB and hence they were interested in what methods had or had not worked in increasing volunteering. These discussions further led on to a collaboration between these members of the Giving Time team and CAB to develop a field experiment using behavioural techniques to motivate citizens to join their campaigners group. It is hoped that the experience of doing this field experiment will help embed a culture of evaluation and enhance research capacity of this organisation. 

A research fellow from the Giving Time team Dr Alice Moseley is engaged in a project with the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) concerning the use of Randomised Controlled Trials, with a particular emphasis on their application in the Arab World. This is a project developed by Dr Eleanor Gao (Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter) in which Alice Moseley has been invited to participate on the basis of experience and expertise gained through the Giving Time Project. The project involves ESRC-funded workshops with civil servants in DFID, and will involve reflection on lessons learned in conducting field experiments in the practice settings which were part of the Giving Time project collaborations. These workshops are currently under development by Dr Gao and Dr Moseley and are due to be run in March/ April 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>80394757-6618-4EA7-88F9-BBB8A4CE269A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56606b1fb87cc1.57815612</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key objectives of the grant were to conduct a set of field experiments to test the effects of forms of 'social information', that is, information about what other people are doing, on volunteering levels. The experiments tested a range of specific social information interventions including email endorsements from peers, politicians and celebrities; personalised online feedback about individual volunteering relative to others, and information and training based nudges combining persuasion and information about peer activities and expert endorsement. We examined the effect of these interventions on various forms of volunteering including student and citizen volunteering for a range of charitable causes, and citizen volunteering for local political office (parish councils).

Our results taken as a whole do not show significantly beneficial effects of social information on volunteering levels, either in terms of hours contributed or numbers of people registering to volunteer or actually volunteering. None of the approaches tested led to significant increases in volunteering, for student volunteers or other groups of citizens such as national trust volunteers or housing association residents. Nor did we find that they helped to recruit more candidates to stand for local parish councils. 

In some cases, we saw small negative effects of social information. For example, providing online information to students with lower levels of volunteering about how much others were volunteering, led to reductions in volunteering amongst this group. Similarly, a mass email to students containing peer endorsement from other students significantly reduced volunteering. 

However we found some positive effects of the social information interventions for particular outcomes. The information and training nudge for example did increase the use of social media for recruiting parish councillors, suggesting it may have changed some of the recruitment practices of parish councils if not the outcomes. The political endorsement email sent to students did increase attendance at volunteering training, although not volunteering itself. Finally, in our email endorsement experiment with housing association residents, endorsements from scientific experts and celebrities did lead more people to open their emails to find out more about volunteering opportunities, although this did not result in greater registration for volunteering opportunities.

Overall our findings suggest that approaches which previous research indicates can significantly increase charitable donations of money do not have the same effect on volunteering, another form of prosocial behaviour. While email campaigns can generate initial interest in volunteering, evidenced by the proportions of people in our experiments either opening their emails or clicking through to find out more, we did not find that they led to greater numbers of people registering as volunteers or actually volunteering. This indicates the limits of such approaches in changing more sustained behaviours as opposed to one off acts of charity.

Our project created learning amongst both academic and practitioner communities about the conduct of effective research partnerships between universities and external organisations including volunteering units, political bodies, housing associations and charities. Lessons were learned about conducting social scientific field experiments in practice settings, and the project helped generate capacity and knowledge about this methodology amongst academics and practitioners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has implications for the many organisations in the nonprofit and public sector currently seeking to expand their volunteer workforce. We held an event in Nov 2015 attended by 60 key stakeholders from student volunteering services, nonprofit organisations, libraries and local authorities who were interested in any lessons from the research that may help in this regard. 

A number of those attending informed us that they would take on board our findings about the lack of impact of social information in generating significant increases in volunteering, and commented that research showing what not to do was as valuable as research showing them what to do. This led to discussions about alternative approaches that may be more effective. Suggested approaches were to tailor mobilisation efforts to people's differing motivations for volunteering, to provide feedback to volunteers about the outcomes of their efforts, and to provide rewards that signify belonging to a group that has achieved something together. In feedback provided at the event practitioners also told us they would undertake approaches based around community animation and citizen social science.

One partner organisation (UCL volunteering services) has already altered their systems and procedures for recruiting student volunteers following their involvement in and learning from the study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2EBB8F77-B75A-4A8B-9822-776C7BEBE38B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>566068bf2e6dc6.20523013</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>839A32D5-8C6D-4953-B023-FE3F687A483A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-connecting the public: can endorsements of citizen social science mobilise civic action?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a89baacbddfeac227bcf4de3f756b09d"><gtr:id>a89baacbddfeac227bcf4de3f756b09d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richardson, Liz</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d47a395ace40.30437394</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A937B8A1-7F01-4602-85B7-E3A9C5709319</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can approaches shown to increase monetary donations to charity also increase voluntary donations of time?
