The DDU initiated a collaboration with the University Hospital Tuebingen to develop a new assay and screen against MKK4. The University Hospital Tuebingen had an option to use the data to help the formation of a new company but with Dundee having rights to the data if the company was not formed.

In order to develop the relationship further we are currently scouting for innovative target biology in line with specific therapeutic areas of interest to Sanofi. These include metabolic, rare and infectious diseases. Sanofi is also very supportive of the DDU's strategy to build an Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) Portfolio and have provided a letter of support for the DDU's application to the AMR Cross-Council Initiative Theme 2 Collaboration Grant Call, which has recently been selected to proceed to a full application.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bcbe38b77da0.66752152</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Eli Lilly and Epidarex visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29A9C85C-F8D7-4113-928E-E090E6F0AEE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A delegation form Eli Lilly and Epidarex visited the School of Life Sciences and DDU meet PI's and discuss potential collaboration opportunities.

The next step in the development of CURE is to identify targets of interest to UCB in the areas of bone diseases and inflammatory diseases. We are currently reviewing two targets identified by UCB in relation to bone disease; HIPK&amp;quot; and YSK4, and are in dialogue with Professor Paul Crocker in Dundee about new siglec targets that may have implications in bone disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c318de5db496.03448196</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Roche visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>160ED257-B8C2-4C0B-A5BA-5C91CDF6D2FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit from a delegation from Roche to discuss potential collaboration opportunities with the DDU.
