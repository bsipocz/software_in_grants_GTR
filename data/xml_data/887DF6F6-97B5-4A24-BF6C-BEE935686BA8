Dispelling the myth of Moreau's isolation, propagated by critics since the 1880s, it also aims to place his art clearly in its historical context, showing how he engaged with contemporary issues (both aesthetic and political) in his iconography and style, with the politics of the art world, from the Second Empire to the Third Republic, and with the art of his contemporaries and predecessors. Further, the project aims to cast new light on Moreau's career as a whole, offering it as a case study in the career strategies of a history painter in the second half of the nineteenth century. The project will thus have a wider resonance for nineteenth-century art history, where much remains to be done on history painting.\n\nThe fundamental working hypothesis of the project is that, reworking the outworn conventions of academic history painting, while remaining passionately attached to traditional humanistic ideals, Moreau sought to save the dying genre of history painting by abandoning the academic tradition of theatricality in favour of a contemplative and mysterious style, influenced by the Romantic ideology of the symbol and by early Italian and Flemish Renaissance art. The result - an ambiguous, interiorised, decorative and symbolic art - was the creation of pictorial Symbolism.\n\nThe project will study the chronological development of Moreau's art and career, from the time of his enrolment at the &amp;Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts, in Paris, in 1846, to his death in 1898. It will combine three interrelated empirical approches: a study of Moreau's thought on his art and career, including the creation of his own museum; aesthetic and iconographical analyses of key paintings by Moreau, both finished and unfinished, studied in relation to relevant works of the past and of his own time; a study of Moreau's critical reception. To elucidate Moreau's thought, it will draw on his published writings and on the substantial unpublished correspondence conserved in the Mus&amp;eacute;e Gustave Moreau, in Paris. The study of Moreau's critical reception will indicate the aesthetic codes within which, or against which, he operated. Much of the book that will be the output of the project will be devoted to the analysis of individual paintings, which will demonstrate the development of Moreau's aesthetic and iconography in relation to contemporary practice and expectations. For the first time, these works will be compared and contrasted to works by other artists, both contemporaries and predecessors. These comparisons will show how Moreau engaged consciously with French artistic cultures, both those of the tradition of history painting and those of his own time, forging an artistic identity in opposition to other painters and by affiliation with heterodox, anti-academic traditions. \n\nIn addition to research already carried out, the project will entail the completion of a survey of Moreau's Salon reception, in periodicals held mostly in the Biblioth&amp;egrave;que Nationale de France; an investigation of Moreau's reception in Symbolist journals and in artists' writings, in order to gauge his influence on Symbolist art; further consultation of Moreau's correspondence in the Mus&amp;eacute;e Gustave Moreau, in Paris; further study of Moreau's activities as a member of the Acad&amp;eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts in the archives of the Institut de France, in Paris; a study of the art exhibited by Moreau's Symbolist pupils in the 1890s, searching for reproductions of lost works published in periodicals; theoretical and historical reading on museol</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate audience of the book that will be the project's output is academic. Its findings will reach a wider audience as they are disseminated through exhibition catalogues and publications aimed at the general public. Its publication by Yale University Press would ensure maximum visibility in the academic world, and an excellent spring-board for its wider dissemination. Gustave Moreau is an artist who attracts international interest and, since 1960, has been the object of a steady stream of exhibitions and publications, in Europe, the USA and Japan. Moreover, the wider movement of Symbolism continues to attract attention from quite a large public, as the number of international exhibitions and books devoted to it attest. By transforming understanding and enriching knowledge of Moreau, and of Symbolism, the project will impact on the cultural life of the UK and far beyond. At present, discussions for a major exhibition on Moreau, to be held at the Royal Academy of Art, in London, are underway between the Director of the Mus&amp;eacute;e Gustave Moreau, in Paris, and curators in the Royal Academy. Should this exhibition come to pass (and sooner or later such an exhibition will surely take place in London), the book will inevitably impact on the exhibition catalogue and, through it, on the British public. I am in discussion with the Director of the Mus&amp;eacute;e Gustave Moreau who assures me that I will be invited to contribute an essay to the exhibition catalogue.\n\nWithout such scholarly studies as the present project, public knowledge and understanding of artists are doomed to remain fossilised as exhibitions and publications aimed at the general public suffer from obsolete intellectual frameworks. By renewing knowledge of Moreau's art and career, and of the Symbolist movement, the project will contribute to the cultural vitality of the nation, and also to knowledge and understanding of the cultural heritage of our neighbours, the French.\n\nThe timescale of the impact is harto predict, but it is likely to take between five and ten years from publication for its findings to filter into the wider domain. I myself will actively contribute to the process by subsequently taking opportunities to publish some of the results in art magazines reaching a wider public (e.g. Apollo, Beaux-Arts Magazine and L'Oeil).\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The outcome of the project is a 125,000-word monograph, Gustave Moreau: History Painting, Spirituality and Symbolism (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2014).

In the project I have developed the following:

- a deeper understanding of Gustave Moreau's contribution to French painting in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially regarding the development of history painting and the creation of a new form of pictorial Symbolism 

- a wider awareness and deeper understanding of the aesthetic and historical contexts in which Moreau operated

- deeper understanding of Moreau's ideology and its reflection in the iconography of his art, especially regarding his religious and spiritual aspirations and beliefs

- a deeper understanding of Moreau's political engagement, especially in the early years of the Third Republic

- a deeper understanding of Moreau's role and aesthetic as a teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, from 1892 to 1897, in relation to a representative selection of students, and in the context of the critical reception of his atelier at the time

- a deeper understanding of Moreau's oeuvre as a whole, in terms of aesthetic development, iconographic patterns and critical reception</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The much clearer picture of Gustave Moreau's ideology, aesthetics and place in nineteenth-century art will be of great use to all those who deal with Moreau's art, such as art historians, museum curators, exhibition curators and educationalists. Building on my research, it will be possible to develop exhibitions placing Moreau in the context of the art and society of his time and to create art-history courses including his work in a more historically accurate and meaningful way.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0A586CB3-1F05-4410-9C0F-CA2B3E0F0FE4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5442432e154449.72990949</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?K=9780300204339&amp;nat=false&amp;sort=%24rank&amp;sf1=keyword&amp;st1=gustave+moreau&amp;m=1&amp;dc=2</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6463111B-71D0-4411-8E0F-E455660A8BA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gustave Moreau: History Painting, Spirituality and Symbolism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8e07873c59b3c268c18e2f4c357b91ae"><gtr:id>8e07873c59b3c268c18e2f4c357b91ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cooke, P.
