British private schooling is quite unusual in international comparison, combining both very high fees and only a low level of public subsidy through tax reliefs. From earlier studies we know that private school alumni educated in the 20th century on average achieved well in public exams and had substantially greater success in the labour market, when compared with similar pupils who attended state schools. 
In the last 30 years the private schools have changed enormously, as has the economy. School fees have risen by around three times in real terms. The pupil-teacher ratio has been halved, physical plant and equipment greatly improved, and a broader range of extra-curricular sport and cultural activities is supported, aiming to instil broader outcomes of cultural capital, more than just a high academic achievement. Systems of management have been modernised. 
There have been no comprehensive studies, however, of changes in private school participation and of the value-added delivered by modernised private schooling in the 21st century. The aim of this project is to investigate two key related aspects of the role of private schools in Britain in the 21st century: the choice of a private school, and the association of private schooling with educational outcomes and with subsequent labour market and broader outcomes in early adulthood. 
We will look at three sets of questions:
1. Participation: 
Has participation in private schooling become more (or less) socially fluid? Specifically, we shall ask: has the relationship between family income and participation been changing over recent years? Has the inter-generational persistence been shifting? Does grammar school proximity make a difference? What reasons do parents give for choosing private schooling? 
2. Educational outcomes:
What are the educational outcomes associated with private secondary schooling, compared with those from state schooling?
3. Early adulthood outcomes:
What are the labour market outcomes (employment, occupational status, pay), personal outcomes (physical activity, well-being) and external benefits (social trust, charitable activities) associated with private school participation at secondary level? To what extent are these outcomes accounted for by the educational outcomes, and how important are social networks? 
To answer these questions, we will use two ESRC investments, the Millennium Cohort Survey (MCS) and the Next Steps survey. We will supplement these with data from the annual Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS), and the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSAS). We will estimate the determinants of choosing private schooling at secondary level. Key explanatory factors will be parental income, family and pupil characteristics, and ease of access to a grammar school. Attention will be given to those who switch school-types at the transition between primary and secondary levels.
Building on this analysis of private school choice, we will then use statistical methods to estimate the association of private school attendance with educational outcomes from secondary school. We will compare outcomes for private and state educated persons from similar socio-economic backgrounds and with similar prior achievements. Finally, we shall produce estimates of the association of private education with labour market and broader outcomes at age 25. 
Together, our findings will provide a scientific picture of the contemporary role of private schooling in Britain. We expect this picture to be useful, both to those involved with the private school sector (parents, advisers, and the schools themselves), and to scholars and policy-makers interested in the wider implications. There is ongoing debate about the schools' charitable status and the &amp;quot;public benefit&amp;quot; obligations that this brings, and about barriers to social mobility.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Debates around private schooling and social mobility continue to surface on both sides of the political centre, and they need to be supported by better, independent, evidence. Past studies have mainly referred to those educated a long time ago. We think that there remains much uncertainty about modern private schooling. While some are confident that a private, very highly resourced schooling helps pupils get better results, others question whether bright children, or those from affluent and supportive families, would succeed in any type of school. We would expect people outside academia to benefit from a clear exposition of our findings, helping them to arrive at their own conclusions about a topic that has for a long time been a highly charged political issue. 

Our findings will provide new, independent, evidence about private school participation and effects for the generation going through schooling in the 21st century, and will thus have considerable policy and practical relevance.

In particular, we expect the findings to be of interest to three groups of non-academic stake-holders, as well as to academics from a range of disciplines: 
a) Potential &amp;quot;customers&amp;quot; (parents) and their advisers.
These beneficiaries tend to be interested in evidence about the value of attending a private school, and our findings on both educational and later outcomes will be informative for them. Parents are interested because, for those not entitled to receive bursaries, the benefits of private schooling need to be substantial to make it worth the considerable outlay for the fees, which have increased by around a factor of three since the 1980s. We expect that parents and education advisers are interested in both the education and labour market outcomes and the broader outcomes from private schooling. They can benefit through more informed decision-taking about whether to choose private schooling for their children and at what stage in their school career. 
b) Practitioners
We expect that the governors and leaders of private schools, and those who represent the sector, are likely to be interested in independent evidence about the outcomes for similar reasons because they must ensure that they deliver what parents want in order to survive and thrive in a competitive education environment. These governors and leaders should also benefit from knowledge of the trends in income sensitivity of their product, and evidence about the relevance of local competition from grammar schools. Among other benefits could be a more informed pricing strategy. 
c) Policy-makers.
We are mainly thinking here of policy-makers (such Lords members debating the recent Charities Bill in 2015) and opinion-formers (eg Times columnist Matthew Parris, Guardian columnist Fiona Millar) -- on both sides of the political centre -- who are concerned to improve social mobility in Britain, and who might wish to have good evidence about the potential role of exclusive private schooling in limiting social mobility. However, we should also include members of the wider public, because of the topic's general interest among those concerned about social mobility. Policy-makers' need for independent evidence is especially apparent when considering potential policies for private schools, such as for example those surrounding partnerships, academy sponsorship, access schemes, public benefit and charitable status, which have figured prominently in public discourse for the last decade. The potential benefit is better policy-making. 
d) Academics.
We expect our findings to be of considerable interest among a broad group of sociologists and economists who work in the areas of education and social mobility/inequality studies (see Academic Beneficiaries). We will aim especially to attract interest among PhD students and early career social scientists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R003335/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
