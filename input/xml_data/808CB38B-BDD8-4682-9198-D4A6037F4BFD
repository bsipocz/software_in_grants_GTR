While, for some writers, the resurgence of religion and religious controversy signals a 'post-secular' era of pluralism and precarious co-existence, for others, the presence of even moderate religion represents a profound challenge to Western values and demands a secular counter-attack. It is the latter position, typified by the so-called 'new atheists', that has dominated the debate, seeking a recovery of 'Enlightenment' values and a stern separation of religion and public affairs. This dichotomy of religion and modernity is preserved by religious 'responses' that seek to diminish the Enlightenment, characterising it as an age of crude and utopian rationalism. 

This study seeks to challenge such a polarising analysis by interpreting secularism and aggressive forms of unbelief as the products of religious consciousness. It does not seek to minimise the realities of secularism and unbelief (as in the 'post-secular' literature). It accepts that Enlightenment culture did and has challenged the hegemony of religious ideas and institutions. But it proposes a very different account to the conventional story of science and theoretical reason assaulting faith. Building on the work of Charles Taylor and others, this project interprets the rise of unbelief in the West as a working out of tensions within Christianity. Much more sharply than scholars like Taylor have argued, however, the study contends that Christian conscience has been the primary challenger of Christian belief and institutions. The claim is that, in the Enlightenment and the nineteenth-century age of doubt, new epistemologies gained currency in the wake of essentially moral protests against Christian 'orthodoxy'. In each major episode of accelerating unbelief the initial impulse was moral and religious rather than essentially rational and intellectual - a pattern that can be shown to include both the 'scientific materialism' of Marxism and the evolution-dominated discourse of the new atheism. 

Far from seeking to polemicise such debates, however, one aim of this study is to offer a more contextualised and sympathetic account of religious alienation than either side of the 'war-of-the-worldviews' model currently offers. Rather than presenting Enlightenment radicals such as Pierre Bayle as cold philosophers, deliberately plotting Christianity's downfall, the intention is to present such figures in the fury and pathos of religious warfare, seeking to combat the fever of religious intolerance and unintentionally cutting the ground from religion itself. 

The study focuses on five critical stages of unbelief, demonstrating that each started with efforts to preserve - rather than challenge - Christian faith. In each case, a reforming religious impulse became a secularising impulse when its aspirations were denied: so the 'evangelical rationalism' of early modern toleration literature evolved into Enlightenment rationalism; religious attacks on capitalism furnished the anti-religious passions of Marxism; and, perhaps most strikingly, the Victorian crisis of faith started with conscience not science. A final chapter considers the 'religious crisis of the 1960s' as the extension of a similar tension within Christianity between freedom and constraint. Civil rights, feminism, and student protest movements attacked religious institutions and laws in the name of Christian values. One of the outcomes of this research is to demonstrate to religious leaders and communities that there are strong and historically justified reasons for secular suspicion of faith. Similarly, this study challenges secularism to identify its own debts to the religious traditions it critiques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has the potential to engage a number of interest groups beyond professional academia, from religious organisations and private individuals to think tanks and policy makers. Some of the material has already been presented in non-academic contexts and I am confident that there will be considerable interest in the research output.

Specifically, the research will be of interest to the following groups:

Think tanks and policy-making organisations as the Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics and Theos have already expressed interest in the research as a way of understanding and navigating debates over secularism and the place of religion in the public sphere. There is a tendency for Christian organisations either to exaggerate or misunderstand the origins of secular suspicion of religion in the public sphere. This research can help them to understand better the historical contours of secular cultures and attitudes, enabling them to find common ground.

Secular and humanist organsiations: When the outline of this research was presented to OUP, one of the aims was to ensure that the material would engage many sides of contemporary debates over religion in the modern world. The intention is not to launch a missile into the 'new atheism' debates so much as provide compelling material for serious reflection among religious and secular groups. It is hoped therefore that the published research will be of interest to secular and humanist organisations. A number of commentators have identified a growing reaction to the aggression of the 'new atheists' and it is hoped that this research can provide materials for more civil and historically sensitive discussion. Plans are underway to debate Christian, Jewish and secular 'readings' of Baruch Spinoza at King's College London.

Some aspects of the research have been presented to student religious organisations and, while it has been challenging to some of their assumptions, I am confident that the published outputs will be of real educational value to them. Religiously committed students are often led to assume polarised and adversarial stances towards university culture. This research can contribute to more nuanced and less divisive perspectives on what one scholar has termed the 'mere secularity' of higher education.

It is also hoped that this research will be accessible and attractive to individual lay readers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Not yet, though I have had interest from some London-based think tanks</gtr:description><gtr:id>DEEF85CE-70C9-4D12-8F82-8DD906A5CC8A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5460bb86b04c34.22479810</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have linked the rise of Enlightenment doubt and religious criticism to a positive Christian tradition of conscience.
