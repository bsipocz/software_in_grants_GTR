His greatest achievement was to conquer the independent kingdom of Northumbria and thereby to become the first king to rule all of England. He retained that power despite opposition from Saxons and Norsemen until his death in 939. ?thelstan's reign marks an important period in the shaping of English identity, but there has never been a major study of his life. Since there is currently considerable interest in the historic roots of Englishness and the relationship between regional and national identities, a life of the first king of the English is firmly. Academic studies of aspects of his rule and of contemporary continental developments (the rise of the Ottonians in Saxony, of ducal families in France and the weakening of the Carolingian royal family) provide a comparative background for a full-scale study. ?thelstan was a major player on a European stage, with a dynastic strategy that saw his numerous half-sisters married into the Carolingian and Robertian families in West Frankia, the ducal house of Saxony, and into Burgundy and Aquitaine; his court offered refuge to exiles from the Carolingian royal house, from Brittany, Flanders and from Norway. These European contacts brought new ideas about royal and imperial leadership and about monastic reform to his court. Seeing his actions in wide perspective produces a more rounded assessment of ?thelstan's significance. 

My aim is to write the first biography of ?thelstan, whose reputation has been overshadowed in popular and professorial imaginations by that of his grandfather. 
The objective is to revise previous judgments by setting the king's achievements in wider contexts: British and European, religious and |cultural as well as political and military. I intend to show tgnificance of the reign in terms of the shaping of a unified England and the strengthening &amp;quot;of nascent ideas of English identity. Writing a biography of an early medieval figure poorly-represented in conventional narrative sources presents its own problems and it is not plausible to hope to reveal insights into ?thelstan's personality. 
The study does, aim, however, to trace the various influences on his actions and to situate his deeds in an informed understanding of contemporary political and cultural developments in Britain and Western Europe. It draws on a wide range of source-material ranging from charters (documents granting land and privileges, whose witness-lists reveal much about the composition of his court), coins ?thelstan was the first English king to be depicted wearing a crown) to law-codes. It makes use also of contemporary continental materials, together with manuscript-books associated with the king. At the front of a copy of Bede's Lives of St Cuthbert that ?thelstan commissioned for the saint's community (then in Chester-le-Street) is a full-page portrait of the crowned king making his gift to St Cuthbert. The book's overall objective is to demonstrate ?thelstan's significance as an individual and to contextualise his life against the backdrop of its age. 
The book will be published in the prestigious Yale University Press series, 'English Monarchs'. These volumes are widely and effectively marketed in Britain, the US and world-wide to Anglo-lexic audiences. Publishing in this series ensures that the limits of the research will be disseminated to a wide general as well as academic audience. ?thelstan's will no longer be neglected. Disseminating to a wide, trans-Atlantic, readership an informed and nuanced understanding of this previously little-known pre-Conquest king will help to recast popular understanding of the origins of England and its early medieval location within a wider world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To widen popular understanding of origins of England as a united realm and of Athelstan as England's first king: 'In our Time: Athelstan' 1 July 2010; BBC Radio 4; 'The Essay: Anglo-Saxon portraits, Athelstan' 11 April 2013; BBC Radio 3.
To strengthen the local community's understanding of the past in Malmesbury Wiltshire (place of Athelstan's burial). Public lectures, widely attended including at Malmesbury Philosophy Town event Oct 2012; BBC History Weekend in Malmesbury Oct 2013 (keynote speaker on opening night in abbey to capacity audience). Book used by abbey and local school to support local historical understanding and quoted in local (unsuccessful) campaign to prevent a new Waitrose from opening as evidence of historicity of town.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A6E9CD32-2230-4A3E-94B5-C24687AE7A44</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5447d9cd1da5b9.85102381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>King &amp;AElig;thelstan's name resonates in few places in contemporary Britain and finds little recognition beyond these shores. Yet during his own reign (AD 924-929), &amp;AElig;thelstan's contemporaries regarded him - in the words of a Breton abbot - as 'one of the most excellent and illustrious among the earthly kings of our own day'. &amp;AElig;thelstan was the first Anglo-Saxon king to have united all the English peoples under one rule, which he did by conquering Northumbria in 927. Thereafter all the other native kings in the British Isles submitted to his rule. He enjoyed a deservedly high reputation at home and abroad and was recognised as a successful warrior, a powerful administrator, innovative law-maker, and devout supporter of the Church. A later English chronicler deemed &amp;AElig;thelstan the most powerful ruler in Britain since the Romans, in whose days 'the fields of Britain were consolidated into one'. 

 Further, &amp;AElig;thelstan played a central role in the royal politics of tenth-century Europe, becoming, through the marriage alliances he arranged for some of his many sisters, a pivotal figure around whom the dynastic strategies of other royal and noble houses revolved. This is the subject of the book chapter written as part of this project. 

 Since &amp;AElig;thelstan clearly possessed many of the attributes most prized among early medieval kings, he would seem a good subject for a biography. Yet not only does no medieval life of him survive, until now, no modern scholar has tried to write one. In order to write his life, it was necessary to piece together a narrative from a range of disparate types of evidence: a few chronicle entries, two letters, six law-codes, about 75 documents granting land and privileges, manuscripts once owned by the king, and references in non-English sources, as well as reports of post-Conquest chroniclers. 

 A conventional biographical form, tracing the life-story of the man from birth to death, proved impossible. Instead my life explored the king in the context of the different spheres in which he operated, seeing him through the various lenses of the several environments in which he lived and worked. That design took the enquiry outwards in a series of ever-widening circles, beginning with the most intimate, familial contexts in which, and progressing ultimately onto the widest national and international stages. Writing a biographical portrait of the king, I drew a series of interconnected images of a complex man who grew out of a difficult (perhaps rather unhappy) childhood to become one of the most powerful rulers in the Europe of his day. My study does not pretend to show what the man was 'really' like. But it does demonstrate that one cannot reduce &amp;AElig;thelstan to any single stereotypical epithet. Through this life, &amp;AElig;thelstan stands revealed in more than one dimension, a king worth remembering, whose life we can celebrate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>King &amp;AElig;thelstan played a key role in the process of the making of a unified kingdom of England and the creation of an English identity. Because he claimed (and sustained by force of arms) hegemony over other rulers in the British Isles, his reign has relevance also for understanding British history. The writing of the first published life of this major pre-Conquest king marks an important stage in efforts to inform a wider public of this significant figure in the nation's past. The two articles in History Today and the BBC History Magazine (with associated podcast: www.historyextra.com/podcast-page ) have reached wide audiences, as did an edition of 'In our Time' on Radio 4 (1 July 2010; http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00sv7wd/In_Our_Time_Athelstan/). Local communities who still remember &amp;AElig;thelstan (Beverley, East Yorkshire, Malmesbury in Wiltshire and Kingston upon Thames, Surrey) all have a particular interest in knowing more of his life. I have given public lectures (to audiences of over 100) to the Malmesbury Philosophytown conference and to Malmesbury School in 2010. In October 2013 I will take part in a BBC History Magazine Weekend event in Malmesbury (timed to coincide with the anniversary of Athelstan's death), where I will speak on a platform with Michael Wood, do a Q&amp;amp;A and sign copies of my book. l have spoken to the Historical Association in Chichester in Oct 2011, to Winchester Historical Association in April 2012 and the HA at Richmond, Surrey in October 2012. I have become a consultant to the project of All Saints Church Kingston to renovate their church, build an education centre and restore the coronation stone back to the site where &amp;AElig;thelstan was crowned in 925; my research has proved important in helping the church articulate the historical foundations underpinning their multi-million pound project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E89BDD85-4F86-466A-B753-DF95E8D76EA5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2101590877.4934626775c6928</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D1F042F0-5C5E-4A89-882F-79916ED26EFD</gtr:id><gtr:title>England and the Continent in the Tenth Century: Studies in Honour of Wilhelm Levison (1876-1947)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/54f8f23f69062c6c52f1845498f874a4"><gtr:id>54f8f23f69062c6c52f1845498f874a4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rollason, David (University of Durham); Leyser, Lecturer in Medieval History Conrad (University of Manchester); Williams, Hannah</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9782503532080</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-4130166903.2593883beaafac</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>054EEB73-52B9-4B46-B650-F657E7CC49AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Athelstan: England's first monarch</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2f80d0979ea3e8772b963fbb96ade4c2"><gtr:id>2f80d0979ea3e8772b963fbb96ade4c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sarah Rosamond Irvine Foot (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_8554270795139d7138</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>32EF04C1-7AC9-4DFC-A178-F86307BA7628</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aethelstan: The First King of England</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05419187d1b13a90240cd6c027f03597"><gtr:id>05419187d1b13a90240cd6c027f03597</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foot Sarah</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780300125351</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_68601382863bf26ee0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D500060/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
