This proposal is aimed at providing an answer to this question. Knowledge of mass exchange between the continents and the oceans is fundamental to understanding and interpreting sea level rise. However, constraining this value has been very difficult until the launch of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. GRACE provides a unique global view of the motion of water across the surface of the planet. Several studies have used GRACE data to estimate the mass gain in the oceans over its lifetime (2002-present). Unfortunately, the gravity changes that GRACE measures are due not only to water entering the ocean, but also due to the ongoing motion of the solid earth caused by the last ice age, a process called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). In an odd coincidence, the ocean-averaged, apparent mass trend caused by GIA is nearly equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the trend of freshwater entering the ocean from the continents. As the ocean-averaged GIA value can only be modelled, it introduces a large uncertainty to the interpretation of the ocean-averaged GRACE results.

Another independent method of measuring the mass change is to observe the change in pressure at the bottom of the ocean. The mass component of water entering the ocean spreads quickly worldwide, thus increasing bottom pressure everywhere. There are two complications, however. First, there are many dynamic processes in the ocean that also impact bottom pressure. For sea level, these dynamic changes often are much larger than the average change in sea level height caused by the water flux. For bottom pressure, though, the variation due the dynamic signals is much smaller than that of sea level, and in certain regions, such as near the equator, it is expected they may even be smaller than the pressure change due to addition of mass into the ocean. Second, the water entering the oceans does not distribute uniformly because the shifting position of the mass causes crustal motion and changes in gravity. These changes produce unique patterns of bottom pressure change, which we refer to as the static ocean response to differentiate it from the dynamic processes.

This proposal will test the hypothesis that bottom pressure measurements can provide a useful measure of the mass entering the ocean. To assess this possibility, we will complete four tasks. First, we gather existing bottom pressure data and generate bottom pressure fields from the GRACE satellite mission data. Second, we compare a number of dynamic ocean model results to gauge our knowledge of the dynamic bottom pressure signal and the variability of this measurement. Third, we will generate a number estimates of the static bottom pressure field, caused by change of water on land and the ongoing response of the earth to the last ice age, to explore the spatial and temporal variability expected due to these sources. Finally, we will combine the previous results to evaluate our ability to extract the globally-averaged mass change at the short time scales (monthly to annually) that are accessible with the available data. In addition, this task will also determine the ideal set of bottom pressure measurements that are needed to estimate the global average on longer time scales. If we find that the bottom pressure measurements are useful, we will create a proposal to the global observing systems that bottom pressure should be added as a component that complements the GRACE mission in the same manner as tide gauges complement altimetry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Academic Beneficiaries section details the academic impacts of the proposed work. They will be summarised at the end for completeness. In addition, wider communities will benefit from the research.

i) Feedback to policy makers regarding sea level change: Sea level change will have a significant impact on society. The results from this study will help scientists to better understand the processes contributing to sea level rise. We will ensure that the information gained from this project, placed in appropriate context, is communicated to policy makers through two channels. First, we will ensure that the results are known to the IPCC assessments. Tamisiea has been involved with the Fourth Assessment Report, and has participated in meetings leading up to the Fifth Assessment. The aggregation of our results with those of the wider community greatly increases the value of the research to policy makers. Second, we will incorporate the results into the ongoing communication of groups at NOC, such as the National Sea Level and Tidal Facility (NTSLF), with government departments, such as DEFRA and the Environment Agency. NOC also contributes to the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership's Annual Report Card. In May 2010, Hughes advised a researcher from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology who was preparing a high-level summary from MPs on sea level change.

ii) Teachers: The videos and animations we develop will be aimed at a general level and will make excellent supplementary material for teachers who want to address the subject of sea level change. Both Hughes and Tamisiea have recent experience in passing information on current areas of research onto `A' Level teachers, and will utilise these past experiences and contacts to publicise the availability of these products.

iii) General Public: While the media frequently focus on the global average of sea level rise, the regional values of sea level change are what will impact society. The videos produced will introduce these issues and show some of the systems put in place to observe sea level change. The videos will be distributed via YouTube and be available from websites of NOC and the Research Centre for Marine Sciences and Climate Change at the University of Liverpool. We will work with the NOC Communications and Public Engagement department to publicise the availability of the videos.

Summary of the Academic Beneficiaries:
i) The sea level community obtains a more robust estimate of the mass entering the ocean, which provides greater confidence on interpreting the regional sea level variations that have the greatest impact on society.
ii) The geodetic community can use the estimate of the oceans changing mass in studies to better understand geocenter motion. Results from these studies could improve GPS and altimetry results, which are impacted by geocenter motion.
iii) The oceanographic community can use the bottom pressure data and variability derived from the static and dynamic ocean models in process studies and data assimilation procedures.
For i) - iii), the results of the study will be distributed via conference presentations and journal articles.
iv) The global observing systems can use the proposed bottom pressure measurement system to cheaply and quickly obtain a new observation that contributes to achieving the goals of the overall observing system. As a representative to GGOS for the PSMSL, Tamisiea can feed the results of the research into the system.
v) The Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) will gain a set of processed and quality controlled bottom pressure data for distribution the scientific communities. The PSMSL will widely publicise to various communities that these data sets are available.
vi) Scientists in general will benefit from animations produced as part of the pathways to impact to better illustrate the causes behind regional sea level change. We will publicise the availability on various mailing lists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>320740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A 3-minute 37-second video explaining how ocean currents contribute to spatial variability in sea level.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B990B5B7-F3A0-406C-A8A0-7911CF113931</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video has been used for public engagement to illustrate the science conducted at the National Oceanography Centre.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8b51b3c5b03.05630259</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Ocean Weather</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwW52rgzN_k&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLb-tDwhZ4KsX1m6hykyH5oIwiG8sTrU_Z</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A 4-minute 36-second video describing how the changing amount of water stored on land can cause sea level to change by different amounts all around the world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A98113DB-EDC2-43A6-ABC7-4903BA298313</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video has been used for public engagement to illustrate the science conducted at the National Oceanography Centre.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8b62b3ac1b5.98090712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Static Variation of Sea Level</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCiVcwLsfI0&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLb-tDwhZ4KsX1m6hykyH5oIwiG8sTrU_Z</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A 3-minute 53-second video describing how how the pressure at the bottom of the ocean is measured.</gtr:description><gtr:id>83CF6A7E-886A-41DE-803F-7D2B81CDCEE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video has been used for public engagement to illustrate the science conducted at the National Oceanography Centre.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8b37dbcfcb6.85868472</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Measuring Changes in Ocean Mass</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdtniivx-vk&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLb-tDwhZ4KsX1m6hykyH5oIwiG8sTrU_Z</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release and interviews related to a resonant mode in the Caribbean Sea: the &quot;Rossby Whistle&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>50241475-EDB8-4F4D-B6F7-EAAA62667A48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following a press release, a number of short press and radio interviews resulted in wide coverage, including the Daily Mail, Huffington Post, and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

The changing mass of the ocean is an important, integrated measurement of one of two primary components of global sea level change. As such, this observation could provide another indication of the global state of the sea level change. We are raising this possibility in international ocean observing forums, with participation at a NASA workshop on Green Cable Systems, which aims to instrument telecommunication cables with ocean monitoring equipment including pressure and temperature sensors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7A88B2E-3B49-4C37-AD84-B6166E1E1031</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>m-207724627.30084047de26d920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Cultural</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Global sea level can change in two ways: water can expand as it warms, filling a greater volume of the ocean with the same mass of water, or new water can be added to the ocean (from the melting of land ice, for example), increasing the ocean's mass. In order to understand sea level rise, we need to be able to separate these two effects, so how can we weigh the ocean to determine how much mass is being added? One method is to use satellite gravity measurements, but there are difficulties with this which leave some ambiguity in the result. We have shown that another, rather simple method is possible. There is a region in the equatorial central Pacific ocean where monitoring the pressure of water on the seafloor (i.e. bottom pressure) would provide a way to weigh the ocean. Using existing pressure measurements, we have determined the annual cycle of ocean mass (Hughes et al., JGR, 2012). While bottom pressure measurements from the equatorial central Pacific would be ideal, existing deployments in this region are rare. Thus, we have extended the study to look at records from 17 equatorial sites and demonstrated that method is robust and that the combination of all observations improves the estimate of the annual cycle of ocean mass (Williams et al., Ocean Sci., 2014). However, to be successful for observing the mass change over longer time scales, a new instrument needs to be developed, as bottom pressure sensors record artificial long-term changes. Until such a device is developed, we explored combining different measurements to estimate bottom pressure changes. In particular, we used satellite sea surface measurements and temperature and salinity measured along the depth of the ocean at a mooring. We found that such a system in the Eastern Atlantic should be able to detect a 1 mm/yr trend in ocean mass with 10 years of observations, approximately half the time to measure a similar trend in sea level at the same location (Williams et al., JGR, 2015). Investigation of sea level and bottom pressure signals in ocean models led to dynamical insights and model diagnostics which directly contributed to three other papers (Hughes et al., Ocean Sci., 2014; Hughes et al., GRL, 2015, Hughes et al., GRL, 2016). As part of the project, we have produced a quality-controlled bottom pressure data product at hourly and daily sampling from 205 deployments at 66 locations. This data is freely available to download in user-friendly formats at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) website. The associated webpage also allow for a quick visual assessment of the data at any of the locations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One or two deployments of ocean bottom pressure sensors could act as supplementary system of observing changes in the ocean mass. This is an important, integrated measurement of sea level change. For this observation system to be effective, development of a new ocean bottom pressure sensor that is stable over long time scales is needed. In addition, the processed bottom pressure records made available at the PSMSL website will assist other researchers in other studies of ocean dynamics and tides.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DDE9143-6E02-4A24-9D99-68D5EE993110</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460deee2b12f9.16471706</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
