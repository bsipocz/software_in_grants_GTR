Onemeasure of a PSA is the tack energy, which quantifies the amount ofenergy required to separate two objects joined by the PSA layer. ThePSA must have several properties for it to have a high tack energy; itmust be soft (have a low shear modulus), it must be resistant to thepropagation of cracks, and it should strain soften initially(i.e. become less stiff as it is elongated) and the strain harden forlarger elongations. If we could tune some of these material propertiesthen the tack energy of the PSA could be changed, and the adhesiveproperties switched.Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have similar polymer chemistry(Acrylate or Polydimethylsiloxane based) to common PSAs. However theyincorporate rodlike molecules (liquid crystals) onto the polymerchains. The rodlike molecules are disordered (isotropic) at hightemperature so the chain shape of the polymers is on averagespherical. At low temperature the rods align with each other and causethe polymer backbone to elongate. The mechanical properties of the LCEare crucially dependent on the orientation of the rodlikemolecules. When the elongation direction is perpendicular to thealignment direction the mechanical properties show a long stressplateau (strain softening) on extension followed by strainhardening. This is the optimal shape for a PSA with high tackenergy. By modifying the state of the liquid crystal rods the tackenergy of the LCE can be switched. For example by switching from thenematic state with the rods aligned in the plane of the adhesivelayer, to the isotropic state (e.g. by illuminating with light) thetack energy of the adhesive could be switched. This will be a largechange as the mechanical properties switch from having a long stressplateau, to a classical rubber.The aim of this project is to investigate the use of LCEs asswitchable PSAs using theoretical techniques. The tack energy indifferent liquid crystalline phases, and with various orientationswill be calculated to ascertain the tack energy change onswitching. The properties of the contact between a rough metalsubstrate and the adhesive layer will also be modeled.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research proposed in this first grant application is theoretical, and it will develop the idea of a switchable liquid crystalline elastomer pressure sensitive adhesive. It is hoped that modeling will stimulate experimental research, and future collaborations to advance this idea further. Ultimately experimental development is necessary to exploit this research for applications. I plan to pursue a larger collaborative project in future, without the constraints of the first grant application (Prof. Terentjev letter of support). This would enable the experimental research necessary for a commercial impact. A significant fraction of the European adhesives market (valued at 11.3 bn Euro in 2009) is the manufacture of pressure sensitive adhesives. Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) have a wide range of applications in electronic equipment assembly and car assembly. The ability to switch them on and off will interest manufacturers both to make their production more efficient, and to implement recycling. The European Union directives Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and End of Life Vehicles (ELV) put the responsibility for recycling on the manufacturers. This research into switchable adhesives will potentially benefit medical, automotive, electronics sectors, and the environment. It will lead to economic impact through its use in the assembly of electronic equipment or vehicles where it could be used to make disassembly and recycling easier. The chemistry involved in these adhesives could be either polysiloxane based, or acrylate based which is the same as current PSAs so the step to commercial applications is realistic. Reversibly switchable PSAs will be useful in medical applications where it is necessary to adjust the position of electrodes or breathing equipment. Drug delivery systems such as skin patches wound dressings for a burns victims or an elderly patient could also benefit. The PDRA and current SCM group members will benefit from the training and experience gained from this project. Group meetings will provide a forum for discussion of this project with other researchers in adhesives and soft condensed matter. Wider discussions through links within SEPnet will also be valuable, to this research project and reinforce links with other Universities. This will benefit both researchers and society as a whole by producing training scientists. I will use existing personal contacts from colleagues at Surrey to make direct contact with companies regarding any promising results. There are a variety of UK companies of different sizes that are interested in adhesives. I have had discussions with Cytec Industries that have encouraged this project and offered to support it in by discussing this idea in relevant research groups, and providing materials should this project develop further (Peter Mills letter of support). I have had some discussions with a small company De-bonding Ltd. which has developed a (non-reversible) switchable adhesive. Yet more businesses could be reached through the networking evens run by British Adhesives and Sealants and Association (www.basaonline.org). To reach the broader scientific community the PDRA and I will write articles in scientific magazines (such as the IoM3's Materials World), and speak to learned societies such as the Society of Adhesives and Adhesion. The scientific research on liquid crystalline elastomer as PSAs will be disseminated through the usual academic channels of conference talks (Gordon Conference Science of Adhesion, US) and publications (Soft Matter, Physical Review, European Physical Journal). Any potential to commercialise the findings of this research will be exploited by making an application to Surrey's Knowledge Transfer Account, and using the Research &amp;amp; Enterprise support office to assist with patent applications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100926</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Liquid crystal elastomers are a rubbery material with anisotropic properties.
