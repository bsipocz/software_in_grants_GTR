They nowadays emerge in search and rescue operations, surveillance, Coast Guard activities, interceptor and security missions, anti drugs and piracy actions, in fast supply to offshore platforms, and for crew transport and wind farm maintenance. The main advantage is their speed, while the challenge is to maintain safe seakeeping at high speeds in mild to heavy seaway, while also keeping these ships affordable, reliable, fuel efficient and comfortable. We propose to develop new simulation tools for the dynamics of fast ships and surrounding waves in breaking seas, and to validate these simulations with advanced and novel towing tank laboratory experiments.

Classical calculations of waves are based on (non)linear potential flow wave theory. Such simulations are quite good provided accurate numerical methods are used, but can never deal with wave breaking due to the potential flow Ansatz. In addition, potential flow wave codes in three dimensions need to become computationally more efficient. This requires further scientific development (work package WP1 at the University of Twente, The Netherlands by Jaap van der Vegt with Onno Bokhove), especially when wave and ship dynamics are fully and nonlinearly coupled, as proposed. Another key issue in WP1 is preservation of the variational formulation of wave dynamics, to ensure numerical stability, within our partially existing discontinuous Galerkin finite element methodology (DGFEM). Our first innovation is to simulate wave breaking around the ships, as well as incoming breaking waves, with a new, advanced single-phase mixture theory for the water-air mixture (in WP2 at the University of Leeds). In contrast to other numerical methods that can deal with wave breaking (such as Volume of Fluid methods and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), our method does not lead to (unwanted) numerical wave damping in areas with smooth waves. Our second innovation is that the new method is by design constructed to include our (variational) potential flow limit with nonlinear ship dynamics. Hence, this new methodology for fast ships in breaking seas does require that the DGFEM for the combined ship and potential flow wave dynamics is fully developed as well (in WP1). Essential is the anticipated validation of both (integrated) simulation tools against advanced and new towing tank experiments. Beyond the numerical validation, these towing tank experiments (in WP3 at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands by Rene Huijsmans) provide direct and new data to the users in the form of the measured (nonlinear and breaking) wave environment around fast ships, pressures on their hulls as well as onboard accelerations. These laboratory measurements will be directly used by our users: Damen Shipyards, MARIN, Royal Netherlands Navy, Royal Netherlands Rescue Organisation (KNRM), Bureau Veritas, and Lloyds Register, while the proposed simulation tools supporting new hull designs will form a sustained investment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Dummy document.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147174</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Maritime Research Institute Netherlands</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Maritime Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>04DE6925-1279-40F6-B261-19C3F511797F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MARIN is supporting our research with advice and may give us access to data in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf40118dfbd7.01484776-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners have advised us in the progress of the research project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have a set up the stepping stone for fully-nonlinear variational and numerical coupled wave-ship interactions, without loss of energy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Maths could help search and rescue ships sail more safely in heavy seas</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99504E65-1317-4989-8036-C85C3C3F2357</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A unique new computer model built on highly complex mathematics could make it possible to design safer versions of the 'fast ships' widely used in search-and-rescue, anti-drugs, anti-piracy and many other vital offshore operations.
Travelling at up to 23-30 knots, fast ships are especially vulnerable to waves that amplify suddenly due to local weather and sea conditions - extreme funnelling effects, for example, may turn waves a few metres high into dangerous waves tens of metres tall that can destabilise ships, resulting in damage, causing injuries and threatening lives.
Developed with Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) support at the University of Leeds by Dr Anna Kalogirou and Dr Vijaya Ambati with Professor Onno Bokhove, the new model produces unprecedentedly accurate animations and simulations that can show exactly how sea waves can affect fast ships. It highlights the importance of having accurate predictions of the pressure forces that these craft are subjected to, and could aid the design of fast ships better able to withstand the effects of rough seas.
The researchers can already simulate the complex interactions of sea waves that can lead to an anomalously high freak wave, but adding the motion of ships into the equation complicates matters significantly.

Dr Kalogirou said: We have managed to develop a simulation tool that uses sophisticated mathematical methods and produces fast and accurate simulations of linear wave-ship interactions. Our tool can also provide measurements in terms of wave amplitudes around ships, as well as pressures on ships' surfaces.

The aim is to extend the model over the next three years to produce a tool that can be used extensively by ship designers and maritime engineers.
The model has been validated through laboratory experiments on a man-made freak or rogue wave (the so-called 'soliton splash') using test tanks. A comparison with wave and ship motion, for a ship moored on two anchors, has been set up in a small test tank, which is also used for public demonstrations.
Results from the project are being disseminated to a range of organisations including the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN). A related European Industry Doctorate project with MARIN on rogue and breaking waves against offshore structures has strengthened Professor Bokhove's EPSRC-funded research on wave impact against ships, as well as his EU-funded work on fixed offshore structures.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c66caf993b83.41686206</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/searchandrescueships/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Maths could help search &amp;amp; rescue ships sail more safely in heavy seas 

A unique new computer model built on highly complex mathematics could make it possible to design safer versions of the 'fast ships' widely used in search &amp;amp; rescue, anti-drugs, anti-piracy and many other vital offshore operations.

Travelling at up to 23 to 30 knots, fast ships are especially vulnerable to waves that amplify suddenly due to local weather and sea conditions - extreme funnelling effects, for example, may turn waves a few metres high into dangerous waves tens of metres tall that can destabilise ships, resulting in damage, causing injuries and threatening lives.

Developed at the University of Leeds with Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) support, by Dr. Kalogirou and Dr. Ambati with Prof. Bokhove, a new model in this line of modelling produces unprecedentedly accurate animations and simulations that can show exactly how sea waves can affect fast ships. This highlights the importance to have accurate predictions of the pressure forces that these craft are subjected to, and so could aid the design of fast ships better able to withstand the effects of rough seas.

To date, the Leeds team has focused on two things: nonlinear sea waves (without ships) that can produce an anomously high freak or rogue wave, and combined wave and ship motions that can be described mathematically by linear equations (see Notes for Editors). The aim is to extend the model over the next three years to include non-linear waves and so produce a comprehensive simulation tool that can be used extensively by ship designers and maritime engineers. As a by-product a laboratory and mathematical model of new wave-energy device has emerged.

Professor Onno Bokhove, who leads the project, says: &amp;quot;Our initial linear wave-ship simulation work represents a vital breakthrough towards development of a unique tool that can assist the design of ships' hulls that absorb or deflect more of a wave's impact, while still ensuring safe seakeeping, reliability and fuel efficiency.&amp;quot;

The (non)linear models have been validated through laboratory experiments of a man-made freak or rogue wave, the so-called soliton splash, using test tanks. A comparison with wave and ship motion, for a ship moored on two anchors, has been set up in a small test tank, also used for public demonstrations. Results from the project are disseminated with a range of organisations including the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN). A related European Industry Doctorate project with MARIN on rogue and breaking waves against offshore structures has strengthened Bokhove's research on wave impact against ships (funded by EPSRC) and (fixed) offshore structures (funded by the EU).

Fast ships deliver all kinds of services in fields such as disaster response, the fight against crime, the provision of supplies for oil and gas platforms and the transportation of wind farm maintenance personnel. Each year, however, around 100 such ships worldwide are lost or damaged in heavy seas, with around 2500 casualties in 2013 (http://www.agcs.allianz.com/assets/PDFs/Reports/Shipping-Review-2014.pdf).

Professor Bokhove says: &amp;quot;Describing mathematically the complex behaviour of waves and their interaction with fast ships and then incorporating all of this into a robust computer model has been very challenging. We are delighted to have provided further proof of how advanced mathematics can have real-world applications that help save money and safeguard lives.&amp;quot;

Technical Remarks
The original proposed mile stones (for 1.5 year of funding):
a) Formulation of a mathematical model for breaking waves in year one.
b) Implementation of linear ship dynamics in linear waves in at the end of year 2. 

After 20 months (September 2015) we achieved the following:
a) The theoretical model for breaking waves (item a)
has been derived and there is an internal report.
b) The theoretical model for the mathematics and numerical
modelling of linear wave dynamics with a buoy with one degree of freedom (both in 2D and 3D), and
a ship with 6 degrees of freedom (item b) has been formulated
in an internal report to date. 
c) The linearized movement of a buoy only moving in the vertical in 2D and 3D waves has been implemented numerically, both for shallow and potential flow water waves: 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZAYHtVoiMqepQflisp66g

The interim results using a buoy in 2D and 3D has a direct application for the novel proof-of-principle wave-energy device Prof. Bokhove and Ir. Zweers have designed and build, see:
http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~obokhove/WaveEnergy.m4v
as well as the youtube-page given above.

These interim results have been introduced to facilitate the step-by-step development of wave-ship interactions.

The most important mathematical and numerical break-through is the development and derivation of a new symplectic/geometric/ variational time integrators for systems with constraints, in this case the imposition of buoy/ship dynamics in (linear) water waves.

We are currently implementing and testing the theoretical model in b) numerically, aiming for a third journal publication.
