Research into the material cultures of home has shed light on the historical continuities and discontinuities of lived experience. In popular culture the family or childhood home has been the subject of both literary memoirs (12 Edmondstone Street, David Malouf) and a popular television series (The House that Made Me, Channel 4). At the same time, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent development of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have reinvigorated the resonances between home and nation in a time of global insecurity. The ongoing world recession was in part precipitated by the subprime mortgage disaster and the subsequent massive waves of foreclosure on people's homes. Through the lens of crisis, the proposed research network aims to produce a fuller understanding of the relationship between home and the imagination at this time of renewed interest in, and transformation of, the home. We believe that a reflection on 'home and crisis' can give insight into how these simple yet resonant terms come to denote more complex categories, both upholding and contesting beliefs about the status of the home, as a physical location and an imagined or representational space.

We are experiencing a period of global crisis operating at multiple levels, private and public, economic and political, environmental, religious. Crises are not new, of course, and understanding the legacy of previous experiences can teach us important lessons about how they have been thought about and managed historically. At the same time, exploring literary, visual and material cultures of home through a focus on crisis produces a common thread through which distinct features of home's representational power become visible. We are especially interested in how the links between home and crisis can be articulated not only in imaginative texts - novels, poems, films, etc. - but also through the many material artefacts and technologies of home and their representation by photographs, family memorabilia, letters, etc. As both a physical location and an object of representation, home functions as an important site through which individuals and societies make sense of their pasts and presents as they map their futures.

The three workshops will bring different disciplinary approaches and methodologies into dialogue, and in doing so explore the ramified meanings of the wider 'Care for the Future' theme. We want to ask how we can care for the future by understanding and learning from the past, and drawing on its wisdom in the present. In particular, through theoretically-informed close reading of literary and cultural texts we want to examine how the imagination performs its vital transformative work. We suggest that, as our recent researches have shown, a humanities-based initiative can have huge value when considering political and other contexts that might more traditionally be the remit of social science. A collaborative approach that extends our individual expertise will allow us to address key questions about home, crisis and the imagination, and ask how work in the humanities can best address them. Through the remit we have given ourselves we will seek to explore the particular ways in which imaginative works have, over history, represented domestic crisis, whether on a private or international scale. Today it is becoming ever clearer how far 'home' policy and global pressures are interconnected, and we believe it is pertinent to ask what contribution the humanities can make to interpreting crisis or potential catastrophe. To be careful, as well as caring, would seem to be increasingly a priority.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our previous AHRC-funded project, 'Imagining the Place of Home', identified a strong interest in the topic from the cultural and heritage sectors. We are convinced that substantial mutual benefit will come from exploiting the overlaps in our needs. The proposed new network will at every stage involve non-academic partners and stage events open to the public. The model of the workshop-as-colloquium is one that is flexible enough to serve academic and non-academic needs, emphasising active participation as well as intellectual rigour. The planned events are designed to carry our academic findings into the public domain. The project engages with a variety of non-academic stakeholders who, together with their associates and audiences, will be the primary non-academic beneficiaries. Using funds awarded through the University of Leeds 'Arts Engaged' initiative, the PI and CI have already developed relationships with a number of non-academic stakeholders, including several museum curators, key figures from Opera North and the Howard Assembly Room at the Grand Theatre Leeds, psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic practitioners involved with the Harry Guntrip Psychotherapy Trust and The Tavistock Clinic, and members of the Centre for Studies of Home and the Geffrye Museum of the Home in London. Individuals with whom we have previously worked, and who have already agreed to take part, include Mr. Dominic Gray (Projects Manager, Opera North); Dr Susan Godsil (Harry Guntrip Psychotherapy Trust and The Tavistock Clinic), and Ms Layla Bloom (Curator, Stanley and Audrey Burton Gallery). The first two will be on our Steering Group, ensuring that the project's work is at all times engaging with multiple audiences. 

We will engage with non-academic stakeholders and the wider public through an open access website, public lectures, and film showings at the Howard Assembly Room (Opera North), which will be advertised to promote the project. There will also be a curated space at the Stanley and Audrey Burton Gallery throughout the period of the network. Further beneficiaries will be researchers at different stages in their careers who will be brought into contact not just with each other but with new audiences of all kinds. The events will be widely advertised to ensure maximum impact, using our existing mailing lists as well as the considerable mailing databases held by the gallery, museum and Opera North. The involvement of Arts Engaged and especially Dr Jasjit Singh, Faculty of Arts Impact Fellow and Early Career Researcher, will be invaluable in identifying and exploring impact possibilities. 

We shall hold a total of three workshops and three public events. The public events will be actively advertised as emanating from the project, with audiences being encouraged to access the website for further information about the activities of the network. All the workshop discussions will be available as podcasts on an open-access website, and usability will be key to its design. We shall use and develop our existing networks to promote the website. The workshops will create valuable opportunities for interaction between academic researchers and professionals in the culture and heritage industries, with the aim of stimulating new collaborations, projects and potential funding bids. A strong public engagement element is crucial, and we want to ensure that the imperatives of non-academic partners (building their audiences, extending their programmes, etc.) will be given the fullest consideration at every stage. See 'Pathways to Impact' for a detailed account of how this will be achieved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26338</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have fed into ongoing discussions with Opera North about programming and content .
