underlying modelling constructs to increase the functionality of the models and making it easier to extend
and personalise the product set. The requirements for the ?next generation? and the objectives of the
proposed AUDEN project are to:
? Enable many vertical sectors to be supported using a common technology base with an extensive
personalisation capability i.e. to make it easy to tailor to the specific modelling/visualisation needs of
each sector as well as supporting different cultural needs (including user interface layout);
? Manage large tiered models consisting of many linked models. In many cases a common model is
required to underpin many derived models of different business processes in the organisation to be
modelled. Changes in the underlying common model must result in the corresponding changes in the
derived models;
? Increase the modelling capabilities by enabling a broader range of established methodologies to be
combined by a user. Organisations can then consistently use a variety of methodologies as appropriate
to their modelling needs.
The key benefits of this approach will:
? In comparison with the normal modelling effort, this new approach will reduce the time to create a model
from 24 to 4 weeks;
? Provide a modeller with a ?pick-n-mix? approach to modelling. All of the proposed changes increase the
capabilities for a modeller to use this approach. From the modelling perspective, the underlying metameta-
metamodel is essential so that a consistent model is produced that will create meaningful and
useful results. Without such a meta-meta-metamodel the results will at best be inconsistent or at worst
meaningless;
? Expand the scope of modelling that can be carried out, and the quality and integration of modelling
results. The creation of rule based diagram construction and repository navigation extends and
complements the innovative approach to the meta-meta-metamodel. Large linked models will allow a
wide range of modelling granularity to be produced using a consistent set of underlying common models
for the organisation.

The key deliverable is a new modelling engine that builds upon the current generic modelling framework but
which substantially enhances its flexibility. The underlying meta-meta-metamodel will be substantially
enhanced and two new components will be developed, namely:
? A stakeholder driven navigation engine and configuration wizard that allows an organisation to define
how the modelling tool is to be used by a group of users. An organization will be able to define multiple
groups each with their own usage configuration;
? A model composition and synchronisation engine that will enable large distributed hierarchical models to
be created and managed. This engine will manage all of the common models and the relationships
between these and the derived models.
The innovations will result in a significant increase in modelling flexibility for the user. Just as important is
the use of a generic approach for the rules and behaviours thereby removing the need to change the tool
whenever a new set of rule types are to be supported (as is the case with the current tool). The key novelty
is the creation of:
? The first generic enterprise modelling tool to enable the use and combination of any established
modelling methodology;
? Unique multi-granular personalisation features that allow enterprise modelling to be usefully undertaken
by a wider group of people who do not have to be architecture and/or modelling experts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236332</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">730095</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
