Thus, a greater understanding of its development has broader societal and economic impacts through informing the teaching of literacy in UK schools, which will support children towards better reading and learning competence, and ultimately provide them with better opportunities in the workplace. This work will also have important pedagogical impacts on the teaching of English to Chinese readers in Hong Kong, where bilingualism is the aim, and the teaching of second-language learners more broadly. 

Short- to medium-term impacts

1. Teachers and teaching assistants in the participating schools are non-academic beneficiaries of this research. We will engage the teachers and teaching assistants from the outset by explaining the purpose of the work and the nature of the tasks, during the data collection phrase. Thus, they will be involved in the execution of this work, albeit to a limited extent. The results will be disseminated to teachers and teaching assistants during the course of the project in the form of both oral presentations and written reports in schools. 

2. Local policy makers and practitioners (e.g., Educational Psychologists) are also non-academic beneficiaries. At the end of the grant, the PI will organise a small dissemination workshop in Lancaster, to which representatives from the LEA, including educational psychologists, in addition to SENCOs, headteachers, and parents will be invited. The purpose of this workshop will be not only to report on the results of the current project, but also to consider the impact of different language skills on reading comprehension development at different stages of reading development. Dissemination will not only cover the findings of the UK English readers in our study, but also what we have learned about children learning to read in a second language. Thus, data from both project sites will inform this dissemination and impact.

The research is of benefit to those outside of the local area, so the main findings and implications will be published on a webpage to make the research immediately and readily accessible to the larger (and international) community.

3. The Research Assistants employed on the grant will acquire specific research skills and more generalisable skills that will support his/her future careers. Thus, the RAs too are beneficiaries of the work. 

4. The children who participate in this work may, themselves, be regarded as beneficiaries. We strive to minimise out-of-class time and (obviously) only schedule testing at times that would not disrupt lessons and progress. The tasks that the children will engage in involve one-to-one work reading stories and answering questions about them, and thinking about and reflecting on language. Thus, the time spent out of class should be regarded as positive and beneficial for these children. 

5. One long-term impact is how data such as ours contribute to evidence-based curricula. To date, models of reading and reading development are largely based on studies of alphabetic languages. Thus, our comparison of two typographically different languages has the potential to inform the current debate about language-general and language-specific models of reading. Cain has been consulted about the proposed changes to the UK literacy curriculum and, thus, has the potential to inform future debates about the teaching of reading at a national level and she is regularly involved in CPD at an international level. Both first and second language learners will be a focus of this impact.

6. A long-term beneficiary group comprises Hong Kong Chinese children learning to read English and other groups of second language learners. Identification of the common correlates of reading comprehension and the determination of the factors underlying the second language reading comprehension proficiency gap will inform the instruction to these groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78383</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Elizabeth School</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>QES literacy research</gtr:description><gtr:id>9BF200FC-295E-45A9-ADF4-0CD77941C18B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funding application (currently under review) to Horizon 2020 with QES as a partner.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba6d725cc950.74344817-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>QES participated in this research project.

This small-scale project did not assess issues of causality so we cannot make direct recommendations to policy makers at present. However, by disseminating our findings to users of research we are increasing awareness of the importance of morphology for literacy in general across the age range. 

We anticipate that these findings will inform future educational research that can directly test causal mechanisms of the relation between morphological awareness and reading. Through that work, we will be able to make clear recommendations on how and when and why to focus on morphological awareness in the school curriculum.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>604EBB06-BBA5-4140-82D0-B47E490267F4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc9d70a69f91.40616972</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Background to the project
Morphemes are the smallest meaning units within (spoken) words, e.g., 'un' is a morpheme that when added to a base word indicates 'not', as in 'unhappy'. An understanding of morphemes is critical for understanding complex English words such as 'unhappy', 'happier', 'happiness', how they are related, and how they help children to understand text. Our research aimed to build on evidence that an understanding of morphemes is related to children's reading comprehension.

What did the children do? 
We assessed children in 3 age groups: 6- to 7-year-olds (N=130), 9- to 10-year-olds (N = 149), and 12 to 13-year-olds (N=158). 

Because morphological awareness is a complex skill, we used six tasks to assess children's understanding of different aspects of meaning and grammatical changes. We examined three aspects of morphological awareness: compounding (combining words), inflection (tense, plurals), and derivation (changing word class). For each aspect of morphology, there was one task that required children to select the correct response and one task that required children to produce the correct response. 

Compounds production:
A wand that a fairy has is called a fairy wand. What is the name for a wand that an elf has?
Compounds judgement:
Which is a better name for a patch that you wear over your ear? Ear patch or patch ear?

Inflections production:
Child : children
Beach : ______
Inflections judgement:
To stick. Jack stuck / sticker / sticked the card together. 

Derivations production:
Drive : driver
Run : _____
Derivations judgement:
To farm. I want to be a farmist / farmer / farming.

In addition to the assessments of morphological awareness, each child completed an assessment of their reading comprehension, in which they read two passages and answered a number of questions on each. We also measured their word reading, phonological awareness, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning ability. 

How does morphological awareness develop with age? 
As expected, children's performance improved with age: the youngest children found the measures of morphological awareness the most challenging, but even the oldest age group was not perfect on all measures. The tasks that assessed an understanding of compound words were the easiest, and the derivation tasks the most difficult. 

Is morphological awareness related to reading comprehension ability and how does the relationship between morphological awareness and reading comprehension ability change over time? 

All types of morphological awareness were related to reading comprehension ability, and none appeared to be more important than another. Contrary to previous research, we found that morphological awareness was more strongly linked to reading comprehension in the youngest age group than for the older children. 

Further analysis has shed light on why morphological awareness had such an impact on the youngest children's reading comprehension: the influence of morphological awareness on reading comprehension was due to the strong influence of morphological awareness on word reading. Children with good morphological awareness typically had better word reading skills than those with poorer morphological awareness. At earliest stages of learning to read, efficient and accurate word reading is one of the key limiters of reading comprehension ability. After accounting for word reading differences in our sample, morphological awareness appeared to play a similar role in reading comprehension ability across all age groups.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings are informative for educational curricula and the publishers of reading
