Breaking with the established practices of the British Academy Hearth Tax Project, the London Hearth Tax Project is seeking both to broaden and to narrow academic approaches: the former through the application of Information &amp;amp; Communications Technologies, and the latter through the posing of precise historical questions. This initiative requires a level of funding and an academic support network far beyond the resources of the funders which have supported the British Academy Hearth Project hitherto (please see 'Other Support' section). The London Hearth Tax Project would meet its objectives (please see 'Objectives' section) through the completion of two major outputs: \n\n1. a two-volume hard-copy edition of the 1666 return, which would also include a series of historical essays addressing the Project's research questions, as well as a critical edition of the 1666 text; and\n2. an online database and Historical Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for London and Middlesex in 1666, which will be integrated with other online historical resources hosted by British History Online .\n\nIn order to complete this work, the London Hearth Tax Project will employ its own professional consultants who specialize in palaeography, archival research, statistics and Historical GIS, complemented by the expertise of the Centre for Metropolitan History at the Institute of Historical Research and the School of History, Classics and Archaeology at Birkbeck College, University of London. The Project would be able to deliver value for money while guaranteeing the highest academic standards because of the combination of the work of volunteers (who are committed to genealogy and family history) with historical auditing processes as set out in the attached Project plan. In short, the Project will enrich understanding of people and places in early modern London through the combination of hard-copy and electronic analyses, which would be highly valued by professional and non-professional historians. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87683</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Record Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>British Record Society</gtr:description><gtr:id>47644B4F-1DE5-4277-A1D2-941E654BE65B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Davies, M., Ferguson, C., Harding, V., Parkinson, E., Wareham, A., eds., London and Middlesex 1666 Hearth Tax (London: British Record Society, 2014)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460d955dfc3c6.05584868-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The General Editor of the British Record Society contributed to the project through providing editorial assistance during the preparation of the volume as well as contributing materials to the final publication.

The principal means of public engagement was through British History Online and Hearth Tax Online; this has provided access to the Project's research, including transcriptions, introductions, analyses, maps and indexes. Reaching national and international audiences, the London Hearth Tax Project has stimulated considerable public interest and has attracted 35,000 individual visitors since 2010 to Hearth Tax Online. A Hearth Tax Online weblog provides an additional forum where excerpts from this research project were published. Since July 2011 a total of 17 data releases were viewed 4,226 times, including during the 2012 Olympics, when releases relating the Olympic venues at Stratford and Wimbledon were show pieced. The hard-copy offspin of the project (with materials available on Hearth Tax Online) has meant that the Project's conclusions can be accessed by a range of users, including those with access to libraries but without IT skills.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09CEC88F-E7B8-48AE-BB74-FD13662DD2D2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54622f1aa8e210.01935463</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Project has been able to show that earlier understanding of the London hearth tax was flawed in its use of data methods.

The creation of the database was a key step towards making the hearth tax returns available online, and allowing historians to browse and interrogate the data in new ways. Full documentation concerning the design and structure of the Access database is available online together with the database itself. (http://www.british-history.ac.uk/catalogue.aspx?gid=54). The database constitutes three tables, the primary one containing the principal data from the transcriptions. Two other two tables were created; one to house archival information, textual preambles and postscripts, and links to the full transcription of the source, and another to contain information about the individual parishes, towns and places listed in the hearth tax returns. The listings from the hearth tax returns were processed in such a way as to maintain maximum flexibility in terms of research potential, whilst at the same time providing for consistency between books, without losing any information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B233B061-1B51-4E5B-AAB6-3EBA3203E4FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The creation of the database allowed the manuscript transcription to be made freely available online via British History Online which can be accessed by academics and the general public.

It is possible to browse the returns by street within each parish, and to search the entire text. A particular advantage of its location on British History Online is the presence on the site of many other sources for British history and the history of London in this period, including other taxation data from the late seventeenth century. However, it does not contain the full array of fields in the original database, which is online in the School of Advanced Study's institutional repository (SAS-Space). 
When the database was completed the research team used as the basis for a full analysis of the data from which statistical tables and geographical percentage maps were produced.
