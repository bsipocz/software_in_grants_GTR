arthritis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G1001516</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Joint inflammation may either resolve spontaneously or evolve into rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic disease which causes joint pain and swelling, and ultimately deformity and disability. People with RA who are diagnosed and treated early do much better than those in whom diagnosis and treatment are delayed. They have less joint damage and long term disability. The best possible response to a drug, a clinical state called remission in which there are no detectable signs or symptoms of arthritis, is only achieved in a minority of people. New research is urgently needed to identify which subgroups of people with arthritis are most likely to achieve clinical remission without the need for drug therapy, or in response to arthritis drugs. This would mean that only those people who need treatment receive it, thus reducing the costs of treatment and the risk of side effects. The aims of our research project are to enable the delivery of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. We aim to establish how to measure the state of clinical remission not only at the bedside but also in the laboratory (eg using new ways to visualise affected joints and combining these with blood tests that assess the health of the immune system), and to identify individuals who may be at risk of developing RA in the future. To achieve these objectives, we will work closely with the pharmaceutical industry to collect information about all clinical studies that have been undertaken in patients with RA. We will then study the characteristics of patients with RA who have been recruited to clinical trials and received either (a) placebo (a lookalike drug but with no effects), or (b) active drug, and use this information to see if we can identify the factors that predict spontaneous or treatment-induced clinical remission. We will also set up a new, UK-wide research study of early RA patients to investigate this in more detail. These patients will receive treatment according to nationally approved guidelines. We will observe them in detail, collecting information about their arthritis and how they respond to teatment. Finally, we will undertake some studies to see if it possible to identify healthy individuals who are likely to develop RA in the future. This could pave the way for new ways to treat, or even prevent, early arthritis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>New cases of inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) may either resolve spontaneously or evolve into rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early diagnosis and prompt therapy with tight control have been shown, in clinical trials, to alter the long-term course of early RA towards a more benign outcome by limiting structural damage and long term disability. Nonetheless, clinical remission is only achieved in a minority of subjects with early RA, and sustained drug-free remission remains a rare event. There is therefore a major unmet need to identify the characteristics of those individuals most likely to achieve clinical remission either spontaneously or in response to specific drug therapies so that new and existing therapies can be targeted to the right patient populations. Thus, identification of accurate predictors of spontaneous resolution, mild disease in early RA, and treatment response would prevent patients being exposed unnecessarily to potentially toxic therapies and permit stratification of patient populations in clinical trial and clinic settings. There is also a need to accurately define clinical and biological outcomes that unambiguously reflect drug efficacy. The aims of this research are to establish reproducible and clinically relevant criteria for ?biological remission states? that incorporate imaging and immune phenotypes, to establish the key predictors of clinical remission in early IP and RA patients and to identify individuals at high risk of developing RA in whom prognostic factors for remission and ongoing active disease can be validated. To achieve these objectives, we will first assemble an inventory of relevant UK clinical cohorts and clinical trials. We will then collate anonymised patient-level data from RA patients randomised, in controlled clinical trials, to receive (a) placebo or (b) active drug, and use this information to establish the characteristics, frequency, duration and clinical consequences of spontaneous and drug-induced clinical remission. A new, UK-wide longitudinal observational study of early RA patients will be established, in which patients will receive intensive treatment according to NICE guidelines. Clinical, imaging and immunological assessments, including novel in vivo assays of resolution, will be undertaken, and the data used to identify further biological predictors and descriptors of the remission state. Finally, we will undertake a feasibility study using existing EPIC/NOAR and UK Biobank cohorts to characterise individuals captured prior to RA onset based on demographic, genotypic and autoantibody profiles. This will provide novel insights into the very earliest phase of the disease and provide a framework for disease prevention strategies in the future.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1397148</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MATURA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>DEA5F932-81A2-4ABC-8DC6-0EBD6A89613E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Medicine

rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Protagen AG</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Protagen joins as a new RA-MAP partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDEF33E3-C2DE-446D-AEA8-6809A9999067</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd99021824f2.13618100-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Protagen plans on examining autoantibodies to over 7,000 human proteins in the serum samples provided by the RA-MAP consortium.

respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UCB Pharma</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCB Celltech</gtr:department><gtr:description>RA-MAP Consortium Industry Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>2843E359-BF1D-4717-AF94-AB1D38FF403E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified

Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs

respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MATURA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>82B52D4E-4E55-4F64-9B03-A7EBCEDCB354</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Medicine

rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs

rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cardiff University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MATURA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F12F8CD-24FE-4113-91E3-58A380FABC8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Medicine

He discussed how precisely can diseases be treated in a way that is specific to the individual patient. He gave an in depth analysis of research in Rheumatology and the fact that there are 8 million people affected by the disease. Despite the complexity of the subject, Professor Bruce managed to make it accessible to the layman.
Professor Bruce alos talked about how research in the UK is fundedm and gave a breakdown of the various research being done by Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Health Research. Whilst the NHS's total budget is over &amp;pound;100 billion, the share devoted to research is under 3%.
For most people, the most fascinating part of the evening was listening to Professor Bruce on the general theme of medication. He he talked about medicine being &amp;quot;partly art, partly science.&amp;quot; Most drugs prescribing is on a trial and error / best guess basis, using the likely benefit to the average person. He talked about &amp;quot;personalised medicine&amp;quot; which would target the medicine to the individual patient, and &amp;quot;stratified medicine&amp;quot; which groups patients into categories to assess which medicine to use, being intermediate between using data for the average person and data for the specific individual.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56defb08bdf548.77721093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.conservativemuslimforum.com/news~events/news-&amp;-past-events/health-event-precision-medicine--an-achievable/287</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at Altnagelvin Hospital</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BDF5115-C278-4D9D-B348-92D901D21B85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Ian Bruce provided a seminar about pevention of RA based on PREVENT RA study.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56defc23c945b6.95740588</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Altnagelvin Hospital CTRIC Arthritis Open Eneving</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F1D5591-50DB-4419-A428-F6C1945DD90E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a talk I was invited to do discussing prevention of RA and what risk factors we know about already</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf1fcddc6490.91814428</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Platform for Investigation' Event at Manchester Muserum of Science and Industry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AABC175-0CA1-4AE4-B2AF-D0B554E3AEAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Manchester researchers were involved in awareness-raising activities at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry held in April 2015.

The Precision Medicine UK: Collaboration Nation event at De Vere Holborn Bars, London, on 9 December was organised on behalf of the Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform by Innovate UK,, National Institute for Health Research, Cancer Research UK,Medical Research Council, Invest Northern Ireland, Health and Care Research Wales and the Knowledge Transfer Network, with the NIHR Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure (NOCRI) coordinating the NIHR's involvement. 

The day formed part of a programme to make the UK a world leader in precision medicine and provided real-world examples of the discovery and development of precision medicine solutions, through talks, panel discussions, workshops and exhibitions with the opportunity to arrange one-to-one partnering meetings.

Precision medicine is an emerging approach to the treatment and diagnosis of disease that takes into account variations in a patient's genes, environment and lifestyle. It aims to better target treatments to an individual's circumstances to improve outcomes for patients.

Representatives from across the NIHR were involved in the day and presented on a range of projects and funding programmes. Professor Bryan Williams of NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre joined the first panel of the day which highlighted UK investments in the invention and evaluation phase of research. Professor Williams' highlighted key NIHR's investments in this space and provided examples of exciting precision medicine projects from UCLH BRC. In addition, a number of NIHR precision medicine projects were presented during the disease area specific showcase sessions. This included Professor Costantino Pitzalis who presented the THERAPIST study on behalf of the NIHR Translational Research Partnership, Professor Simon Mead's who presented a project at NIHR Queen's Square Biomedical Research Unit on the &amp;quot;dementia chip&amp;quot; and Professor Tariq Sadiq's who presented on Capacity Building and Delivery of Precision Medicine in Sexual Health, through NIHR Funding. Mark Samuels, Managing Director of NOCRI, also chaired a discussion panel themed 'Enabling Collaboration', which highlighted the value of collaborative working between companies, academics, charities and patients.

The event saw the launch by the chief executive of Innovate UK, Dr Ruth McKernan, of a new map of the precision medicine landscape.

A whole range of organisations, including charities, health bodies and devolved administrations are coordinating their work under the umbrella of Innovate UK's Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform, with NOCRI representing the NIHR.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dee413435550.71650745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uk-pgx-stratmed.co.uk/index.php/event-calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2015/12/09/213/73/-</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open Innovation in the NHS workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF97D6E3-D52C-42CB-8C14-C9E5CEC19CF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the 2nd April 2014 the Academy of Medical Sciences hosted a workshop in partnership with the Centre for the Advancement of Sustainable Medical Innovation (CASMI) to bring together members of academia, industry, the NHS, funding bodies and IP experts. The discussion focused on the key issues and opportunities surrounding collaboration with the NHS, focusing particularly on 'open innovation' models of partnership. Professor Andrew Cope (PI of RA-MAP study) contributed by presenting the MRC/ABPI-funded RA-MAP consortium as an exemplar of open innovation in the NHS and model of academia-NHS-industry collaboration.

Delegates enjoyed four case presentations that highlighted the advantages of open collaboration models and also some of the barriers and frustration involved with these partnerships. Following a candid and constructive period of discussion, delegates highlighted four areas that they considered to be the most significant barriers to open innovation. These were: lack of metrics, poor incentivisation and reward for innovation, cultural conflicts between sectors and poor use of existing structures. Delegates then worked in groups to consider novel solutions to overcoming these barriers and facilitate open innovation partnerships with the NHS.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54634aaa2bc6d1.12455528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/policy/policy-projects/open-innovation-in-the-nhs/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>465000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>EU IMI2 (Rheuma Tolerance for Cure [RTCure]) - KCL</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0A59C621-8DD9-42E0-95ED-AD9297A8BDAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7cbedb1c473.08033369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Multiple</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>465000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>EU IMI2 (Rheuma Tolerance for Cure [RTCure]) - Newcastle</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1DA9F320-EF1B-4983-B785-07A00A7CB850</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c90a4ed1f7c6.94182178</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Multiple</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>109465</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

[Updates from March 2016]
We are sharing curated public data in the database with the MRC-MATURA, MRC-PSORT and IMI-etriks projects
Knowledge sharing and troubleshooting between these projects has enabled more rapid data curation and data infrastructure development for the project. We have also provided advice and troubleshooting on TranSMART configuration to the MRC-CHART (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis) and MRC-Masterplan (SLE) consortia 

[Updates from March 2017]
As a complex, highly curated dataset, the RA-Map TranSMART is serving as an exemplar for development of TranSMART for the the MRC-MATURA, MRC-PSORT and MRC-MASTERPLANS projects. The project is also being used as a successful exemplar for multiple MRC stratified medicine applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546366c2a60281.18012622</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>TranSMART RA-MAP Multiomics database.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Innovative Medicines Initiative eTRIKS team have provided technical support to the RA-MAP informatics team (Mike Barnes lead) to assist in the deployment of an open source datamart (TranSMART) for the RA-MAP projects.
