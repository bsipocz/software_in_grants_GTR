The award has enabled a global survey to be conducted of relevant international and regional developments in the role of parliaments, which has identified an emerging consensus and established the need for a more coherent narrative of this worldwide development and greater focus on how to increase the role of parliaments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project's findings are already being put to use by the project's partners worldwide, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of which all the world's parliaments are members; the Commonwealth; and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, in their work with many national parliaments. The findings may also be taken forward by interested states at UN level in further events and discussions about the role of parliaments, including in a possible inter-sessional seminar in the autumn of 2017, and eventually in an international consultative process about the content of some internationally agreed Principles and Guidelines, culminating, within 2-3 years, in the adoption of such Principles and Guidelines and their agreement by the UN General Assembly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F8C4C067-4FCE-4F03-9793-A0184AE53366</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58cb214f1e7cb5.28164279</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-and-subject-groups/parliaments-rule-law-and-human-rights-project</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Adoption by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Secretary General</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D887BC9B-092A-4C6B-A693-FE5ABA5DC9EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impact has been the enhancement of the role of parliaments in their oversight of Governments on matters relating to the rule of law and human rights. The impact has been both on particular national parliaments, which have changed their practices and procedures in order to enhance their effectiveness after assessing their capacity against the draft principles and guidelines generated by the research project; and at the more systemic level on the approach of the UN to encouraging parliaments to enhance their role. Evidence of this impact can be found in the statement of Gianni Magazzeni, Chief of the Americas, Europe and Central Asia Branch, Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in May 2016, that &amp;quot;I am really convinced that the Oxford University Project on Parliaments, the Rule of Law and Human Rights is of great value to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in its ongoing work on enhancing the oversight function of Parliaments with respect to human rights policies and actions of Governments as well as in ensuring international principles on Parliaments and Human Rights are considered and eventually agreed up by the international community&amp;quot;; and in the statement of the UN Secretary General's Report on Interaction between the United Nations, national parliaments and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in June 2016 that &amp;quot;The continuing discussion between the United Nations and IPU concerning the development of principles to assist parliaments to fulfil their role in the protection and realization of human rights should be accelerated. Once adopted, the principles should form a solid basis to guide joint United Nations-IPU support to parliaments in the area of human rights.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58cb1d363c2dd2.51375514</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F1C1DF8-AF8B-43E1-9EB4-621B0B3DFC62</gtr:id><gtr:title>Global developments in the role of parliaments in the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law: An emerging consensus</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c848a31a8e5b3b46caa1c75d68be0b0"><gtr:id>0c848a31a8e5b3b46caa1c75d68be0b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chang B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58cb0abe6bfd12.53851640</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P504610/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
