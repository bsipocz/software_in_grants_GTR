Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L019078/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Brucellosis is the world's most widespread zoonosis, imposing a substantial burden on the livelihoods of poor people as a result of human disease and reduced livestock productivity. However, brucellosis is rarely a priority for health systems and for this reason the WHO classifies brucellosis as a &amp;quot;neglected endemic zoonosis&amp;quot;. The main routes by which people can be infected are consumption of contaminated dairy products and direct contact with infected animals. Therefore, the control of human brucellosis depends on its control in animals, mainly ruminants, while its detrimental effects include both animal and human disease. Although a range of tools (diagnostics, vaccines) are available and have been used, sometimes successfully, to control brucellosis in different parts of the world the disease remains present at high levels in others. It is likely that failure to control the disease is due to a combination of factors, some of them technical (e.g. quality and appropriateness of different vaccines for different settings), others socioeconomic (livestock keepers perceptions towards the disease and incentives for its control) or institutional (priority given by veterinary services to the disease, lack of interaction between animal health and public health services). 
In this project we target one of the livestock systems in which Brucellosis is likely to pose the heaviest burden on vulnerable populations in Sub-Saharan Africa: dairy farms supplying milk to rapidly growing urban populations in West and Central Africa, and we will do it by integrating a range of disciplines so that we consider the different biological, social and institutional dimensions of the disease that are relevant for its control. We will focus on the first phase of control of the disease: the reduction of its prevalence by means of vaccination, since total eradication requires conditions that are not currently met in the target area. The so-called peri-urban dairy farms are an important source of wealth in poor settings and a source of protein in increasingly urbanised African populations. Furthermore, there is evidence that this region has the highest prevalence of ruminant brucellosis in Sub-Saharan Africa.
We will carry out a series of field studies to measure the burden of brucellosis in livestock productivity and human health in the main areas for peri-urban dairy production in the 15 target countries, to identify routes by which people become infected, to quantify the economic consequences of the disease for farmers and to understand farmers' perceptions and attitudes toward the disease. In parallel we will carry out a series of training activities and we will work with local institutions to identify barriers for effective and sustainable control and to overcome those. The results will be used to design and carry out 2-year control programs based on vaccination in a small number of settings. The effectiveness of these control programs will be carefully monitored and the results widely shared within and outside the region.
Central to this project is the Interstate School of Veterinary Science and Medicine of Dakar (EISMV) a regional educational hub that involves 15 West and Central African countries. EISMV academics will work in partnership with UK-based researchers from two leading veterinary and medical educational institutions: Royal Veterinary College and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and with the international reference laboratory for brucellosis at Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency. The Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed), an organization which works globally to facilitate access of poor livestock keepers to affordable livestock vaccines, medicines and diagnostics will also be an essential part of the consortium contributing to the translation of our research findings into tangible benefits for vulnerable populations and livestock keepers in poor countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>As one of the most prevalent zoonoses, brucellosis is an important constraint on the livelihoods of poor people acting both directly on human health causing chronic disability and indirectly via decreased livestock productivity. The heaviest burden is currently on vulnerable populations in Sub-Saharan Africa where emergent livestock systems (per-urban dairy farms) as increasingly required to supply milk to the rapidly growing urban populations. Transmission to humans is mostly by the consumption of contaminated dairy products and contact with infected animals. A range of diagnostic tools and vaccines are used in developed settings and have successfully controled brucellosis in animals and hence humans in different parts of the world. Their use however in LMIC animal health programmes are hampered by several technical, social and economic factors g. quality and appropriateness of different vaccines for different settings, livestock keepers perceptions towards the disease, competing demands lack of incentives for its control, unrecognised human burden from the disease. This project will be on peri-urban farm systems in collaboration with the Interstate School of Veterinary Science and Medicine of Dakar (EISMV) a regional educational hub in 15 West and Central African countries. A multidisciplinary research and development programme linking appropriately to industry is proposed to provide biological, social and institutional answers to the effective control of the disease by vaccination. Field studies will measure the burden of brucellosis in livestock, productivity and human health peri-urban areas identify routes by which people become infected, assess farmers' perceptions and attitudes toward the disease, assess vaccines for effectiveness in livestock, and explore key stakeholder and institutional relationships to identify how to effectively deliver use control measures for Brucella. Training and capacity building will be a central part of the work.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries from this research will be:

1. Dairy farmers in the main peri-urban dairy production zones of the 15 West &amp;amp; Central African countries targeted by the project. 
All of them will benefit from more effective and sustainable ways of reducing the prevalence of brucellosis in their animals, including improved access to vaccines, improved local diagnostic capacity and improved awareness of veterinary and public health services of the burden of disease and of livestock keeper's priorities. These benefits will gradually build along the 4.5 years duration of the project. Furthermore, we expect the subset of farmers from areas selected for implementation of 5 control programs as part of the project to directly benefit from a reduction in the prevalence of infection towards the end of the project (years 4-5). Peri-urban dairy farmers from the target countries but located in areas not targeted by the 5 control programs, could benefit from the expansion of programs to their areas after the conclusion of the project. In summary, peri-urban dairy farmers will benefit from enhanced and more effective public and private services in relation to brucellosis control and from higher productivity as a result of lower prevalence of an infection that compromises reproductive efficiency and milk production of their cattle. Eventually, keepers of livestock of all ruminant species could benefit if our project succeeds at instigating national control programs for brucellosis in their countries.

2. The local population exposed to direct contact with dairy cattle in the above systems (livestock keepers, farm workers and their families) will benefit from a decreased risk of infection as prevalence in cattle is reduced. Brucellosis is associated with a considerable burden to the local population through subacute disease and chronic disability and its control in ruminants is likely to reduce direct transmission to humans. 

3. Similarly to the previous group, the much larger population of consumers of milk and dairy products from the above livestock systems will benefit from a lower risk of exposure to Bucella spp via consumption of contaminated products. 

Other beneficiaries will include:

Governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations involved in animal health, livestock production and public health, which, at the end of the project, will be in a better position to fulfil their mandates with regard to this important disease as a result of the empirical evidence generated by the field studies, the capacity building activities and the institutional work.

Private actors across the vaccine chain (manufacturers, retailers, vaccinators), veterinary and public health services and diagnostic laboratories will benefit from capacity building activities associated to the project.

Private actors across the emerging local dairy production chains in West &amp;amp; Central Africa will benefit from increased consumer confidence in the safety of their products.

The Interstate School of Veterinary Science and Medicine of Dakar, which is a major regional hub for veterinary education that actively engages 15 countries, will greatly benefit from acting as a key partner in this project through the establishment of functional links with leading educational institutions (LSHTM &amp;amp; RVC).

Similarly, diagnostic laboratories in the 15 target countries will establish links with the OIE international reference centre for brucellosis at AHVLA.

We are targeting countries and a production system with the highest prevalence of brucellosis in Sub-Saharan Africa and therefore with maximum potential impact from enhanced disease control. However, our project aims at enabling the implementation of a new generation of sustainable prevalence reduction programs for brucellosis that could be applied in other resource-scarce endemic settings beyond the target area and we will devote the last months of the project to maximize dissemination and impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1769536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Farmed animal disease and health (FADH)</gtr:department><gtr:description>FADH BBSRC- Indian Department of Biotechnology initiative</gtr:description><gtr:id>C897D965-CCE2-4E2B-B9EE-482881595CD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enhancement of current diagnostic protocols for brucellosis serology</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02b318dc843.38080463-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge and methodology sharing between the two projects which have broadly similar aims in different settings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Knowledge and methodology sharing between the two projects which have broadly similar aims in different settings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Livestock</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Niger, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Central Laboratory of Livestock</gtr:department><gtr:description>Laboratoire Central de l'Elevage NIGER (LABOCEL) (Niamey)</gtr:description><gtr:id>A79231F5-9197-4BEF-B279-B8A1C256F9FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Logistics for data collection including collection of biological samples in Niamey-Niger have been started.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c99b92df4127.66793403-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This partner has facilitated all the logistics needed for the fieldwork and started data collection in Niamey-Niger</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our main contribution is the design and implementation of an epidemiological study of dairy farms in a peri urban area in Niamey-Niger to ascertain i) the frequency and distribution of brucellosis in dairy cattle ii) identify risk factors for brucellosis in and iii) assess the Knowledge attitudes and practices of livestock owners regarding brucellosis in this area.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>CZ Veterinaria</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>CZ Veterinaria</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E0FB32B-433D-4192-8786-C776723A0EDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Staff from the company participated as trainer in diagnostics workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02c04d43fc6.76007676-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Participation as trainers in the diagnostic workshop in Dakar.

Recently, FAO staff have been advising a PhD student associated to the project and we expect their involvement to intensify as the project progresses. Specifically, FAO has a number initiatives to promote the safety of animal derived foods including milk, and our work on a milk-borne pathogen is highly relevant in this context. Furthermore, the focus of one of the PhD projects associated to this project is microbiological hygiene of milk produced in periurban dairy farms in Senegal. The collaboration with FAO will facilitate engagement with local stakeholders and eventually the dissemination and impact of findings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Mali, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Central Veterinary Laboratory</gtr:department><gtr:description>Laboratoire Centrale V&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute;rinaire</gtr:description><gtr:id>57DA2BAB-1E83-4A85-9D8D-3963CF478B5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Logistics for data collection including collection of biological samples in Bamako-Mali have been started.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e9a8472e30.24967212-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This partner has facilitated all the logistics needed for the fieldwork and started data collection in Bamako</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our main contribution is the design and implementation of an epidemiological study of dairy farms in a peri urban area in Bamako-Mali to ascertain i) the frequency and distribution of brucellosis in dairy cattle ii) identify risk factors for brucellosis in and iii) assess the Knowledge attitudes and practices of livestock owners regarding brucellosis in this area.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Development Research (IRD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institut de recherche pour le d&amp;eacute;veloppement (IRD)</gtr:description><gtr:id>2109F979-07B8-49AE-A3BD-0A847E9A9FD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of this colaboration the area of Niakhar in Senegal has been selected as one of our focus areas where to conduct field studies in dairy farms and human subjects.

The focus of the workshop was diagnostic of brucellosis in the West and Central region of Africa. However, other broader aspects such as current disease burden, diagnostic capacity, access to vaccines and barriers to control of the disease in each country where discussed in detail. A total of 28 participants from both human and animal health sectors in 14 countries in the region attended the workshop and contributed to the dissemination of information and sharing of ideas between countries in the region. Guests also attended form FAO regional offices and private healthcare companies. 

Feedback form the participants was very encouraging, some examples are given below;

'We are planning to undertake a brucellosis control program through vaccination, and our first goal is to ensure about le prevalence of brucellosis infection in our herd. That will implicate the use of appropriate and accurate test of diagnosis in term of use the different techniques I learnt about during the workshop on brucellosis diagnosis in Dakar at the EISMV under your supervision.'

'The training allowed us to orient ourselves in the diagnostic methods and kits to choose from. Thus, under the current performing diagnostic laboratory, we will systematically seek brucellosis before clinical cases of abortion. But also included in the monitoring of zoonoses systematic control of milk on farms.'

'In the surveillance of yellow fever and measles, we receive many suspected cases especially for yellow fever after diagnosis is not confirmed. After this training I plan to make the diagnosis of brucellosis in these samples.'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02e7ab91ad0.63568368</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://zelsbrucellosis.wordpress.com/activities-so-far/diagnostics-workshop-dakar-june-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As a result of the workshop on Brucellosis Diagnostics held in Dakar in June 2015, all participating laboratories across the region (15 countries) received training in appropriate serological techniques and laboratory procedures for Brucella diagnosics in both humans and animals.

Involvement of the UK laboratory in charge of brucellosis diagnosis as the provider of training and technical advise as part of this project has benefited the UK lab by gaining access to samples and test results from endemic areas, which may eventually improve the way brucellosis surveillance is carried out in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A10698E-2F15-4860-A744-59FA62C991A3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e142ed1bbed6.71223211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Through the situation anlaysis that has been carried out we have collated knowledge and developed a network of people in the region.

It has also established a solid network of people with a range of skills and experience to work together towards a sustainable disease control programme. Through this network we have been able to set up a number of field studies on brucellosis in periurban dairy farms of several countries which are currently ongoing and are one of the key elements of our 5-year project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the situation analysis show i) the current state of knowledge with respect to brucellosis in periurban dairy farms in the target countries and ii) the main gaps and areas where more research is required to effectively tackle this disease in this livestock system. By identifying barriers such as i) the lack of reagents for diagnostic testing, ii) lack of baseline knowledge to design bespoke control programs or iii) lack of access to vaccines, researchers, governmental agencies, NGOs and international agencies aiming to support brucellosis control are in a better position to target specific issue that preclude effective control. 
In the coming months we expect to generate much needed prevalence estimates that should ad to the evidence base needed to design and implement suitable, locally-adapted control programs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F55F7718-2586-47FC-ADEE-B5589E46B46F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e14532986d90.55289004</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://zelsbrucellosis.wordpress.com/activities-so-far/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Standardisation of brucellosis diagnostic techniques across the region</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36246F27-E861-4D21-9147-F7A2DEE7E045</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of the Diagnostics of Brucellosis workshop held in Dakar in June 2015, all participating labs across the region received training in appropriate serological techniques and laboratory procedures for Brucella diagnosics in both humans and animals.

'The situation with the milk ELISA presents a strong and specific example of tangible benefits these projects bring back to GB. There is some concern in GB that the ever increasing number of animals contributing to bulk milk samples presents a risk that individual infected animals will not be detected. The best way to study this is to try the milk ELISA in a situation where brucellosis is present in some herds and where we can test individual milk samples (and sera ideally) for the animals contributing to the bulk tank. This is clearly not possible in the UK but will be achieved through the ZELS project. Additionally, a redesign of the milk ELISA aimed at increasing sensitivity and robustness whilst maintaining specificity that will directly address the concerns related to the sensitivity of the surveillance of the GB dairy can now be evaluated in the field though the ZELS project as described.'</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6D1A1E8-F6B8-4E58-A1D0-0C9521847084</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further enhanced the collaboration with FADH BBSRC- Indian Department of Biotechnology initiative who are using the same techniques.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e031f75a1664.22297853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Improvement of serological testing technique for brucellosis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2015</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3B967A1-5FE6-42E7-BE79-AB0FF3B85FF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Workshop on Brucellosis Serological Diagnostics, Workshop Report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8"><gtr:id>6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craighead, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e026620672d3.26486722</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>99B88710-2CA5-4979-AEEE-B9703F8657E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Brucellosis in West and central Africa- Situation Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8"><gtr:id>6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craighead, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e146de6c6e38.18217503</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7165F744-8C37-4588-8544-695197D394D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Brucellosis in West and Central Africa: A review of the current situation in a changing landscape of dairy cattle systems.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta tropica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/374238ba6eb50eef06c3a826021ff995"><gtr:id>374238ba6eb50eef06c3a826021ff995</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craighead L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-706X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8ab1f316ba65.43796793</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A99B9222-D338-4F5F-8504-FC473D49AD1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>https://zelsbrucellosis.wordpress.com/</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8"><gtr:id>6a4e99fe85616e8d6bdc6b1279357cc8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Craighead, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e0254f0ec692.74291683</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L019078/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A2A69ED-37ED-4980-91A7-E54B4F6A9BC6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76F0E6B-0363-4D1F-9F5F-353AFD4E9DB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Livestock production</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
