&lt;p>The project will also consider the many ways in which the local is (and are) governed, suggesting that there are multiple places and engagements considered to be local and many different forms of governance including local government law and practice, counter-terrorism initiatives, planning and place-making.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will engage with questions of exclusion and what has been called ?spatial justice?. It will investigate the relationship between the idea of local autonomy and local identity and what happens if law enables communities to realise their vision on the ground, excluding some types of residents or behaviour that do not confirm to this vision.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The primary outputs of this research will be:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>scholarly articles and a book&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a network of experts and actors&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a conference stream on methodologies and law and society approaches at the Socio-Legal Studies Association Conference in 2013.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project will benefit all those interested in 'the local' and those tasked with or interested in the advancement of a localist agenda. It will provide public servants, policy analysts, community groups, campaigning organizations, lawyers practicing in the private sector and interested individuals with resources on localism, clarifying how the idea of the local differs from conventional understandings of local government. It will do this in three ways: through a blog, a network made up of academics and practitioners and by a strengthening of the capacity for socio-legal research, particularly by younger scholars, to inform, critique and guide policy making and practice.

With localism currently front-page news, this research fellowship aims to capitalize on this current level of interest by establishing a blog on Law, Localism &amp;amp; Governance. This will provide a one-stop shop on the legal and governance aspects of localism and will maintain a directory (with links to the relevant webpages) of individual local projects implementing principles of localism, echoing the compilation archived by CABE in its catalogue of 'sustainable places' as well as becoming a repository for academic research on localism. The blog will be a community site, drawing on the abilities and range of expertise offered by collaborative and guest editors to provid a meeting place for multi-disciplinary contributions and insights from practice. It will provide inspiration and critique, identifying common threads and investigating tensions. 

One distinctive feature of the blog, though this will only be one aspect of the site, will be its reliable legal content. One of the aims will be to track the rolling legislative programme for localism in all policy fields including health, criminal law, environmental law, planning law and local government law. The extensive analysis of the Localism Bill 2010 in the specialist press, blogs and twitter illustrated that while public servants and policy analysts often have an excellent understanding of legal provisions they frequently seek confirmation of their analysis from qualified lawyers, particularly on the broader context of public law, the impact of human rights and the relevance of EU law. There appears to be space for a blog that contains reliable and up-to-date legal analyses of legislation, regulation, by-laws and caselaw produced with the usual caveats that provides an informed, analytical response to developments and pronouncements. 

The research fellowship will also provide the resources to establish a network of practitioners and academics that will meet twice in Cardiff as well as engaging electronically on the blog. This network will enable the participants to make connections and to evaluate and engage robustly with concept of the local and localism within a collaborative environment. The network will co-produce the outline of the project report, with members submitting short pieces of analysis and comment. Being cross-disciplinary, it may well lead to future collaborative research. Certainly it will require academic researchers concerned with localism to test their findings amongst informed and experienced practitioners.

Lastly, the emphasis on strengthening and extending skills in empirical research methods within the academic community, particularly through a conference stream at the Socio-Legal Studies Association conference, will support a younger generation of empirical legal scholars to develop theoretically informed empirical legal research. Empirical legal research provides valuable insignts into legal practices and procedures explaining how legal 'knowledge work' impacts on social institutions, business and citizens. By contributing, from the bottom up, to support and networking for younger scholars interested in empirical legal research, this project has the capacity to act as a catalyst to deepen understanding and inform policy-making in a wide range of policy fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114636</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE6A44D1-029D-44C9-A885-5C9943122C1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>There are eight million stories in The Naked City</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Law in the Built Environment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a12d92b6e66f824ba5f68996c6d39232"><gtr:id>a12d92b6e66f824ba5f68996c6d39232</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bennett L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54620195e13dc1.10411405</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5792AA3C-9CB7-4DA0-BD22-BC314813E776</gtr:id><gtr:title>Law and localism: the case of multiple occupancy housing</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Legal Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/11d442dc0475eccaa416e326b006175c"><gtr:id>11d442dc0475eccaa416e326b006175c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Layard A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06b06b03af1f5</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J004642/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>14079A7C-98F3-44F0-8076-E04DD1E6615C</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J004642/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>171520.99</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>068456C1-2765-4194-8CD8-386BE9BB94DE</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J004642/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>114636.46</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>F14F69C1-AAB7-486D-B78E-E95C2203204D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J004642/3</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>5039.43</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
