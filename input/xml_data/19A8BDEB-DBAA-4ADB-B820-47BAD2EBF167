Fasciolosis has a profound, negative influence on animal health and welfare, undermining our food security and causing major losses to both food producers (farmers) and food processors estimated at ~$US3 billion/year worldwide and at ~&amp;pound;300 million/year in the UK. In the UK, the major impact of liver fluke is on agriculture, where losses at farm level are dramatic and were estimated to be &amp;pound;25-30 per infected animal in 2011; liver condemnation at abattoir due to liver fluke is 26% in cattle and 6% in sheep. A major concern relating to fasciolosis in the UK is the fact that climate change is causing an increasing risk of fasciolosis outbreaks. Indeed, estimates of changing liver fluke prevalence in the UK have forecast unprecedented levels of fasciolosis risk in parts of the UK by 2050. 
Currently, there are no vaccines against liver fluke such that farmers rely on the administration of drugs. The main drug (flukicide) used to control liver fluke is triclabendazole (TCBZ) as it is the only drug with significant efficacy against both the adult worms (which lives in the bile ducts) and juveniles (which, after being swallowed encysted on vegetation, migrate from the intestine through the liver to the bile ducts, causing much damage in the process). The over-reliance on TCBZ for liver fluke control has led to drug-resistance, which has been reported in Australia and across Europe. Indeed, TCBZ resistance in the absence of new drug classes or vaccines threatens the sustainability of livestock farming in some UK regions. Clearly, there is a pressing need for new drugs to control liver fluke. 
Most of the drugs which are used to control worm parasites do so by disrupting the ability of their nerves and muscle to work together and coordinate normal behaviour. In other words, the best drugs disrupt normal parasite motor function. The disruption motor function would prevent juvenile fluke from completing their damaging migration and would prevent adult fluke from attaching to the host bile ducts, feeding and reproducing, quickly resulting in worm death. Therefore, a better understanding of liver fluke motor function will allow more informed approaches to new drug / flukicide discovery efforts.

Several recent developments associated with liver fluke have seeded this project. First, the liver fluke genome sequence is almost complete and data from the genome will include key information on their motor function. To exploit these data, we need to be able to identify which of the motor function genes / proteins identified from the genome sequence are critical to their survival. A key development here is our recent discovery that liver fluke are amenable to reverse genetics, a technology which allows us to select a gene in the worm and to switch it off (or silence it). We have now optimized this technology in liver fluke such that we can silence any gene from the worm. After gene silencing, a worm which behaves normally would indicate that the gene is not a good drug target whereas one which shows aberrant behaviour or dies would associate with a gene that has been validated as a good drug target. By using the genome sequence to identify genes involved in motor function in fluke and then by silencing these genes in turn, using reverse genetics, and monitoring the effect that this has on worm biology, we will create a pipeline of validated drug targets. Critical here is the ability to exploit these validated targets quickly for liver fluke control. To this end, this project involves the support of an industrial collaborator who will adopt validated drug targets into their drug screening programmes to facilitate the discovery and development of new flukicides. In this way, basic research on the liver fluke genome and biology is rapidly used to help discover new drugs for liver fluke control.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Fasciolosis has a profound, negative effect on animal health and welfare. It undermines food security and causes major losses to food producers/processors estimated at $US3 billion/year worldwide and at &amp;pound;300 million/year in UK. Losses at UK farm level were estimated to be &amp;pound;25-30 per infected animal in 2011 with associated liver condemnations at abattoir running at 26% in cattle and 6% in sheep. There are no liver fluke vaccines and the dependence on triclabendazole, the only drug with significant efficacy against both migrating juvenile and adult fluke, is unsustainable in the face of drug-resistance. Further, climate change is causing an increasing risk of fasciolosis outbreaks and modelling approaches have forecast unprecedented levels of fasciolosis in parts of the UK by 2050. The liver fluke genome is being sequenced and this project aims to capitalize on this resource to identify and validate new drug targets and to exploit these for flukicide discovery. Most leading anthelmintics target motor function effectors, components of nerve-muscle signalling systems that regulate normal behaviour. We propose to identify/annotate selected core motor function effectors in fluke, and to prioritize these using our target validation toolbox. Preliminary selections based on known 'druggability' and on the occurrence of aberrant phenotypes upon knockout/knockdown in related/model organisms will be screened for expression in both juvenile and adult fluke. Promising candidates will be scrutinized using our optimized RNA interference methods which are interfaced with an array of in vitro/ex vivo phenotypic screens, providing a pipeline of validated targets. Where RNAi dynamics are appropriate, in vivo RNAi screening will provide additional validation for up to five targets. Finally, within and beyond the lifetime of this LINK project, our industrial collaborator will move to translate validated and approved targets for flukicide discovery/development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research programme, through the discovery, validation and exploitation of novel drug targets in liver fluke, will help drive efforts towards new flukicides for liver fluke control. The project will showcase the direct translation of 'omics' technologies for parasite control and will inform industry, government, funding bodies and the general public about the development of rapid routes from basic biology to impact. 
The non-academic beneficiaries relevant to this proposal include:
1. Pharmaceutical/Biotech Industries: Through this LINK proposal, the industrial partner has already committed to developing prioritized targets validated in this project and developing these to screens for flukicide discovery. In addition to those targets selected for exploitation by our industrial collaborator, genome annotation of motor function effectors in fluke will provide a catalogue of putative targets and 'validation toolbox' approval will provide a pipeline of validated targets open for exploitation by other Pharma. These data are relevant to those industries developing treatments for animal or human fasciolosis, and will include the potential for job creation and/or the employment of appropriately trained researchers. This LINK proposal will hasten the exploitation of basic science.
2. Local Farming/Agricultural Communities: Liver fluke costs UK farmers ~&amp;pound;25-30 per infected animal. Livestock producers will receive economic gain in the long-term through novel drugs that are free from resistance and therefore more effective. Alternative drugs will improve the sustainability of livestock production systems through reduced numbers of treatments, and an increase in animal health/welfare and productivity. Increased productivity will drive economic prosperity in all trades/businesses involved in the 'production to consumption' system.
3. International Farming/Agricultural Communities: The greatest humanitarian impacts of Fasciolosis are associated with agricultural areas i developing countries where the consequences can be devastating for poor rural communities. Fasciolosis is threatening the livelihoods of many farmers and their families who rely on livestock, not only for income, but for food. Further, liver fluke are posing growing problems as food-borne-pathogens in these areas. Novel flukicides will improve the health, well-being, and quality of life of those afflicted with fasciolosis.
4. Stakeholders and Policy Makers: UK-based government bodies [Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development-Northern Ireland; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)] and Levy boards, and other representatives of the Agri-Food industry will benefit as it will provide an evidence-base for policy development and in addressing EU-directed changes in agricultural legislation.
5. Educational Sector: Local schools will benefit from this research by educating both primary and post-primary students about liver fluke biology, and through raised awareness of the importance of research in our society. In addition, research findings will form the basis of research-led teaching to undergraduate students at Queen's University and during invited speaker lectures delivered at both national and international undergraduate and postgraduate teaching institutes. The host-institute will benefit through an enhanced research profile.
6. General Public: Consumers are demanding safe, chemical residue-reduced food that is produced cost-effectively from animals maintained in a welfare-friendly environment. A novel anthelmintic that is not undermined by resistance will facilitate a reduction in drug use, therefore reducing food contamination. The environmental impact associated with intensive drug use will be reduced. The general public will also gain an understanding of one of the most significant diseases affecting the health of their local livestock and food security, and will have opportunity to engage with scientists at the coal-face.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189480</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sanofi</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:department>Merial Plc</gtr:department><gtr:description>Merial-Link Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FBD3CDB-A3AE-45B0-A600-AC05A8CA9DA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

The liver fluke Fasciola hepatica is the cause of considerable economic and health burdens around the world with an estimated global cost to the agriculture industry of $3.2 billion and 17 million humans infected. The infective juvenile stage of this neglected tropical disease causing parasite has long been the focus for research into novel drug and vaccine targets. However, with ever increasing amounts of genomic/proteomic information about this parasite now available there is need for novel functional biology methods. A significant drawback to functional studies in liver fluke is the lack of research into the stimulation of growth and development in vitro. Here, we report development of a culture system that stimulates growth and development of juvenile fluke, supporting 80% survival for more than 200 days (more than two fold longer than in any previous study). These juveniles underwent developmental changes consistent with those reported in vivo, including elements of tegumental, reproductive and gut development towards more adult-like morphologies. This growth and development was supported by proliferation of neoblast-like cells (putative totipotent stem cells), which originate throughout the parenchyma. These cells then migrate, differentiating into mature cells in distinct tissues. These data represent enhanced methods for maintaining juvenile fluke through simulation of in vivo developmental triggers, and will enable study of previously intractable developmental changes in juvenile fluke. This will facilitate in vitro study of developmental processes and evaluation of potential drug/vaccine targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c71587f905.48737994</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Anthelmintics from discovery to resistance - San Francisco/San Diego, USA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D658ECE3-99AA-4091-992C-799BE839FBB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fasciola spp. trematodes continue to inhibit the productivity of global ruminant agriculture, causing lost revenue on a billion dollar scale. Liver fluke are also responsible for zoonotic infections of humans, with an estimated 17 million humans in the developing world affected by fascioliasis. We are reliant on a single flukicide (triclabendazole) active against both adult and invasive juvenile life stages, a drug for which resistance has been documented in both veterinary and human infections. Despite these issues, no new broad-spectrum fasciolicides are in development, and no preventative vaccines are available. In an effort to contribute to drug discovery efforts, we have developed RNA interference (RNAi)-based functional assay pipelines for juvenile liver fluke, with which we aim to identify / validate new molecular targets that are essential to liver fluke biology. Amongst our targets of interest are three calmodulin-like genes (CaMs 1-3). These CaMs are expressed in myocytons throughout juvenile worms and have profound RNAi phenotypes that implicate functions in both development and motility. Silencing of CaMs 1-3 yielded juveniles that developed significantly more slowly in vitro than untreated/control-treated worms, and also migrated more rapidly through an agar-based motility assay than untreated/control-treated worms. Significantly, both of these RNAi phenotypes were recapitulated following treatment with trifluoroperazine, a known inhibitor of calmodulin-Ca2+ binding, providing independent validation of the RNAi data. These findings represent the first studies of CaM function in whole fluke and suggest that CaMs represent valid targets for novel fasciolicides. Experiments aiming to establish the impacts of these phenotypes on liver fluke infectivity in vivo are ongoing.

In helminths, GPCRs are receptors for both classical and peptidergic neurotransmitters, where they are involved in core neuromuscular functions that have led to their adoption as promising targets for new anthelmintics. Most flatworm GPCR data are derived from Schistosoma spp. blood fluke, while GPCRs have also been mined from cestode and planarian genomes. Several GPCRs have been deorphanised, again primarily in schistosomes. No GPCRs have yet been described in the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. This study employs Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based around the GRAFS GPCR classification scheme to annotate at least 95 GPCRs from a draft F. hepatica genome. These comprise frizzled-, glutamate-, rhodopsin-, and secretin-like sequences; notably, adhesion-like GPCRs appear absent. Homology analyses divide the rhodopsin family into aminergic GPCRs (including putative adrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors), peptidergic GPCRs (including receptors for allatostatin-, angiotensin-, capa-, neuropeptide F/Y-, and tachykinin-like peptides), and orphan receptors including putative representatives of the flatworm-specific PROF1 family, previously described in schistosomes, cestodes and planaria. Notably, the Fasciola PROF1 complement appears contracted relative to schistosomes. Our dataset also includes 11 putative flatworm-specific 7 transmembrane receptors without homologues in other genera. This work represents the first description of GPCRs in liver fluke. These are druggable targets of value for discovery screens, and will also enable analyses of fluke neuromuscular functions. We are currently engaged in efforts to map the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these receptors, alongside functional/validation experiments using gene-silencing methods.

Fasciola hepatica, the liver fluke, is recognised globally as a significant agri-food industry burden, and now increasingly as a human health issue with around 17 million people thought to be infected. In recent years efforts to identify novel targets for drugs / vaccines have focused on understanding gene and protein expression in infective life stages of the liver fluke. To assess the candidature of these targets we used RNA interference to silence potential target genes in infectious life stages of the liver fluke. Unfortunately, these efforts were hampered by a lack of available in vitro functional biology platforms, and so we initially sought to improve these techniques. We achieved over 60% survival in vitro of juvenile fluke over six months, whilst simultaneously triggering growth, such that juveniles grew to an average of 38.5x their original size, with a few fluke growing to &amp;gt;220x their original size. Juveniles exhibited extensive gut, tegument and reproductive tissue development, similar to that seen in vivo. This fluke maintenance platform offers the first opportunity to apply functional genomics tools to examine growth and development in juvenile liver fluke which we have found to be supported by proliferative cells known as neoblasts. Validation of the platform has shown that RNAi persists much longer in non-growing compared to growing juveniles. The transcript recovery seen in growing worms was reduced via repeated, transient dsRNA exposure which subsequently resulted in increased protein knockdown compared to that seen in non-growing juveniles. Additionally, we report the first gene knockdown in F. hepatica adults following microinjection-based delivery of dsRNA to trigger RNAi. These enhanced methodologies provide a growing toolbox for the interrogation of fluke biology and the validation of new control targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c5d085abe9.63137947</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.extension.iastate.edu/registration/events/conferences/membrane/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NemaTours Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8704838C-90FB-4151-8E70-1FF448876E5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBSRC-funded research data sparked a 20 min Q&amp;amp;A session after invited presentation; much additional engagement by academic groups keen to adopt methods reported at meeting

Fasciola hepatica liver fluke causes considerable economic losses to the agriculture industry of at least US$3.2 billion annually and poses a significant human health burden with over 17 million people infected. The infective juvenile stage of this neglected tropical disease causing parasite has long been the focus for research into novel drug and vaccine targets as it causes the acute form of the disease and is a key drug/vaccine target for effective liver fluke control. With rapidly improving genomic/transcriptomic data for fluke there is a pressing need for effective functional genomics tools that facilitate research on liver fluke biology. A hurdle to gene function studies is the inability to maintain developing liver fluke in vitro for extended periods. Here we report the development of a culture system that facilitates juvenile fluke growth and development; supporting 80% survival for more than 200 days (more than two fold longer than in any previous study). These juveniles display developmental changes in the tegument, reproductive system and gut that are consistent with those reported from flukes recovered from hosts in vivo. We have found that juvenile fluke growth and development is supported by the proliferation of neoblast-like cells (putative totipotent stem cells), which originate throughout the parenchyma. Once formed, these cells migrate, differentiating into mature cells in distinct tissues. These advances in monitoring in vitro development are now facilitating the evaluation of genes thought to be involved in growth and development and have the potential to enable their control target candidature to be evaluated using RNAi-based gene silencing. Here we examine the utility of RNAi as a method to probe gene function in developing fluke and optimize methods for sustained gene knockdown and functional studies on aspects of worm development. We have found that a single exposure to RNAi triggers enables effective but transient knockdown in fluke that are developing rapidly. However, multiple RNAi trigger exposure protocols enable prolonged gene silencing studies that facilitate the study of fluke developmental biology. Here we report the use of this platform to probe the function of genes associated with development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c775b68691.13101413</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Society of Parasitology Conference (Cambridge)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD79C5BB-3DEB-4256-AA00-295203FD90AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral Presentation on 'Fasciola hepatica: in vitro maintenance and evaluation of unique tegumental proteins as novel control targets'

The liver fluke (Fasciola spp.) costs the global agri-food industry ~$3.2 billion every year and up to 17 million humans are infected. Resistance to triclabendazole (the flukicide of choice) is increasing, contributing to the need for novel drugs and / or vaccines. We have been investigating five Fasciola-specific tegument proteins (designated Fh-TEG-1 to Fh-TEG-5) that have targetappeal due to their potential for surface expression and their lack of homology to host proteins. Using qPCR these genes were monitored in newly excysted juveniles (NEJs) over the 3-week period post-excystment -only Fh-teg-3 and Fh-teg-5 were expressed immediately following excystment, although during subsequent in vitro maintenance, Fh-teg-1 and Fh-teg-5 showed rapid upregulation. Importantly, all five tegumental genes are expressed in adults; mirroring independent RNAseq data for both immature-stage and adult F. hepatica. RNA interference (RNAi) of Fh-teg-1 and Fh-teg-5 in NEJs across a variety of time points was used to ascertain their importance to worm biology in vitro. No aberrant survival phenotypes were detected during in vitro maintenance. Ongoing studies on Fh-Teg RNAi-worms are examining tegument structure using electron microscopy and generating recombinant Fh-TEG-1 and Fh-TEG-5 to facilitate vaccine trials. For many helminth parasites, the inability to maintain them in vitro for extended periods limits opportunities for experimental manipulation. Here we also report our efforts to maintain liver fluke in vitro to advance the exploitation of its susceptibility to RNAi-based interventions. So far, we are able to maintain in vitro juvenile worms in excess of 80 days and adult worms over 1 week.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2cd5e6282f5.44595917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sir Hans Sloane Lecture (The Ulster Museum)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F670C3BD-E4F7-422C-9FD2-4C4EBBEC40A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Subsequent feedback from various Schools wanting visits and further discussion on the topic

The liver fluke (Fasciola spp.) costs the global agri-food industry an estimated $3.2 billion every year and up to 17 million humans are infected. Resistance to triclabendazole (the flukicide of choice) is increasing, contributing to the need for novel drugs and / or vaccines. A proteomic study (Wilson et al. 2011; Int. J. Parasitology, 41, 1347 - 1359) identified five Fasciola-specific tegument proteins of unknown function (designated Fh-TEG-1 to Fh-TEG-5). These proteins could represent appealing targets due to their potential for surface expression and their lack of homology to known host proteins. Using real-time PCR expression of these genes was monitored in newly excysted juvenile (NEJ) F. hepatica over the 3-week period post-excystment. It was found that only Fh-teg-3 and Fh-teg-5 were expressed immediately following excystment, although during subsequent in vitro maintenance, Fh-teg-1 and Fh-teg-5 showed rapid upregulation, with expression peaking 72-96 hours post-excystment. Importantly, all five tegumental genes are expressed in adults. These expression data mirror independent RNAseq data for both immature-stage and adult F. hepatica. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown Fh-teg-1 and Fh-teg-5 in NEJs across a variety of time points to ascertain their importance to worm biology in vitro. No aberrant survival phenotypes have been detected during the 3-week in vitro maintence of RNAi worms.

Infections caused by Fasciola hepatica, the liver fluke, have severe impacts on the agri-food industry, and are increasingly recognised in humans. In recent years efforts to identify novel targets for drugs / vaccines have focused on understanding gene and protein expression in infective life stages of the liver fluke. We have focused on evaluating these targets using RNA interference to silence potential target genes in infectious life stages of the liver fluke. An impediment to this work was the limited survival of juvenile fluke in vitro. To resolve this issue we recently developed an in vitro maintenance and growth platform for juvenile liver fluke that allows us to maintain and develop juvenile fluke for months. We sought to investigate if juvenile in vitro growth led to greater transcript and protein knockdown following RNAi treatment. Validation of the platform has shown that RNAi persists longer in non-growing newly excysted juveniles (NEJs) compared to growing NEJs. The transcript recovery seen in growing worms was reduced via repeated, transient dsRNA exposure which subsequently resulted in increased protein knockdown compared to that seen in non-growing juveniles. Additionally, we report the first gene knockdown in F. hepatica adults following microinjection-based delivery of dsRNA to trigger RNAi. These enhanced methodologies provide a growing toolbox for the interrogation of fluke biology and the validation of new control targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c66f6c4902.79253345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.irishparasitology.com/news.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>57000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (DELNI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Dynamics of Gene Silencing in Liver Fluke</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of Northern Ireland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>03AEB233-C9D4-4DDA-952E-14863C2F7EF9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463ad67db07f9.49396463</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>57000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (DELNI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Neuropeptide System of the Liver Fluke</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of Northern Ireland</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>835267B2-C838-4AA7-97A0-2D01D6AEC541</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463acfcb2b0f7.22614835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The academia-industry collaboration grant (LINK) has facilitated the identification and testing of new putative flukicides which are being trialled.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D881A9E7-FD45-4210-A06F-19B739B8A51F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463eb30596925.15033179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Dramatically improved methods for the in vitro maintenance of liver fluke that facilitate the study of growth and development in this parasite without the need for laboratory animals; improved methods for the identification of new drug and vaccine targets for liver fluke control; discovery and of multiple new putative targets from the brain and muscle systems of liver fluke parasites; expansion of gene silencing technology to in vitro maintained fluke across distinct developmental stages; screening of several flukicidal compounds (supplied by our industrial partner, Merial) which proved to be more potent than the existing front-line flukicide, triclabendazole.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once these are published, they can be adopted by the research community and will likely reduce the use of laboratory animals to maintain liver fluke</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>843EAC85-3F7A-4690-9BDD-C93D9F5667EB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463e8387c60c7.87083095</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Building on a handful of reports from the 1970's, we have developed simple methods enabling long-term maintenance and growth of juvenile liver fluke in vitro.
