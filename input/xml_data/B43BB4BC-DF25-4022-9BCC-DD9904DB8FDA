These incompatible elements, including the noble gases and halogens, are continually released from the Earth through magmatism at mid-ocean ridges and arc volcanoes. Until recently, it has been accepted that this flux was one-way; volatiles are only released and never returned back into the Earth's mantle. However, with the advent of new high-sensitivity measurement techniques, it has become apparent that the isotopic/elemental composition of the Earth's mantle contains an Ar/Kr/Xe signature that is identical to seawater. Because this is a unique composition in the solar system, the only credible explanation is that a non-disrupted seawater-like noble gas signature survives the subduction process, generally thought to exclude more than 98% of input volatiles. Given that the noble gases are between 100 and 100,000 times more soluble in fluids than crustal minerals, even small amounts of fluid transport would be expected to fractionate the noble gas composition of the subducting rock. How then do noble gases, and halogens, escape removal and fractionation during subduction? Where do the volatile phases reside in the downgoing slab? Over what distances are they transported by metamorphic fluid flow? And, critically, what quantities of noble gas and halogens are returned back into the mantle? I propose to undertake the first systematic analytical characterization of the noble gas and halogen elemental/isotopic composition of the subducting slab. I will conduct these state-of-the-art volatile measurements at Oxford's Noble Gas Laboratory, one of only few laboratories worldwide with the required expertise and analytical technology. Measurements will be performed on minerals and fluid inclusions from a rock sample suite collected from several key high-pressure metamorphic terranes, representing different portions of the slab and preserving differing degrees of volatile-loss. Once the host phases have been identified, the pressures and temperatures that the noble gas and halogen compositions equilibrated at will be calculated using thermodynamics. Rock samples will also be collected across several representative lithological boundaries to determine fossil noble gas concentration profiles, preserving a direct record of the relative roles of fluid flow and reaction during subduction. I will construct a numerical model to deconvolve these profiles into key transport parameters, quantifying the degree to which the noble gases are decoupled from the transport of water-rich fluids in the slab. When combined with existing models of subduction dehydration systematics, this will allow, for the first time, estimates of the subducted noble gas flux to the mantle to be calculated. This novel interdisciplinary project will be the first to link the noble gases and halogens with the metamorphic evolution of the subducting slab. Accordingly, the proposed research has the potential to deliver a step change in our understanding of how volatiles are processed during subduction. Future research avenues include investigating the effects of these return fluxes on the chemical and physical evolution of the mantle, using models of whole-scale mantle convection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct impacts of the proposed project are to the scientific research community (as documented in Academic Beneficiaries), with economic and societal impacts being indirect, but nevertheless very timely. The indirect societal impact arises from the central role that volatiles play in mediating long-term climate change and in triggering catastrophic earthquakes and volcanic activity at subduction zones.

The behavior of incompatible elements such as the noble gases and halogens is tied to the behavior of other volatile species, including H2O and CO2, both of which are instrumental in driving climate change. There is enormous public interest in climate change and yet the contribution of tectonics, and, specifically, the subduction process, to Earth's climate cannot currently be quantified. Using the noble gases and halogens as tracers for H2O and CO2 behavior during subduction, the results from this research program will serve to address this issue.

Specifically, nine out of the ten largest earthquakes to occur in the last century were subduction zone events, intimately linked to the release of volatiles from the subducting slab. More than 7% of the global population lives within 100km of an active arc volcano, the explosive eruptions from which are strongly controlled by the migration of slab-derived fluids during subduction. These regions are also rich in economically important precious metals, formed as a result of metal precipitation from hydrothermal fluids. Tracing the length scales and depths at which noble gases and halogens are released from the slab will have direct implications for each of these societally applicable phenomena. 

Furthermore, deliverables from this research program include reactive transport models for the passage of gases through porous media. This is of fundamental importance to both the geological storage of CO2, hydrocarbon exploration and production, and the dating of aquifer-bound groundwaters. Accordingly, this fellowship has strong potential to induce industry collaboration, notably with Shell, who funds the Shell Geoscience Laboratory at Oxford.

Impact-related milestones and measures of success implemented during the tenure of this Fellowship will include: 1. Publication of peer-reviewed journal articles; 2. Presentation of research findings at international and national conferences; 3. Launching of a Fellowship website; 4. Effective dissemination of science outputs from the fellowship to a general audience through school lectures, Oxford Sparks and the University Museum of Natural History; 5. Attracting early-stage geoscientists into Masters or NERC-funded PhD projects related to better understanding volatile exchange between Earth reservoirs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>514271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collation of representative suite of rock samples from number of different sources (collaborators, fieldwork and existing samples).</gtr:description><gtr:id>EB797713-2794-4539-B907-4638B1731790</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Suite will allow investigation of noble gas processing during subduction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dec4508c23e6.42377573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Collation of representative high-pressure rock samples</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collected comprehensive dataset of isotopic composition and concentration of Ar in key high-pressure metamorphic minerals.
