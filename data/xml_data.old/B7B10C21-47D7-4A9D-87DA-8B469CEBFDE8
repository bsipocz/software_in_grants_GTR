It aims at comparing the performance of several database replication protocols, which protect against non-crash failures and are based on use of diverse, i.e. different by design, database management systems (DBMSs). These DBMSs are developed by different vendors, and can be either commercial (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle), or open-source products (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL). The experimental evaluation will be conducted using two approaches: a model-based approach and a direct experimentation on a testbed with &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; systems.
Diverse database replication protocols have a potential of providing higher dependability assurance than traditional approaches that are based on the use of the DBMSs from the same vendor (research from the Centre for Software Reliability (CSR) at City University London has contributed significantly to that finding). However, besides achieving appropriate dependability level, system designers and other DBMS stakeholders are interested in the performance characteristics offered by alternative solutions. For many applications performance is, in fact, the dominant criterion in the selection process.
A fair and thorough performance comparison between database replication protocols, including the ones studied in this proposal, is of great benefit to system designers when making decisions about which one is most suitable to integrate in their system. This is the main motivation of the proposal.
The project aims at comparing the performance of three database replication protocols which guard against non-crash failures and are based on use of diverse DBMSs: our DivRep (the reference point), SES and Byzantium. There are two main objectives of the particular performance evaluation to be achieved:
- Objective 1 - evaluation based on using &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; systems on an experimental testbed, i.e. using respective implementations of the replication protocols together with the real DBMSs.
- Objective 2 - model-based evaluation, whereby each replication protocol, as well as DBMS resources, are represented with a suitable model (implemented in a particular tool of choice) and the protocol performance measured by simulation of the respective model.
Performance comparison of DBMSs and related replication protocols is too often based only on the comparison that uses (synthetic) benchmarks, which in most cases do not reflect the operational profile of the system under test. In addition, there are limits to what one can achieve with performance comparison based only on experimental evaluation with &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; systems: one can feasibly explore only a limited range of parameter values (such as number of replicas, ratio between read and write operations, etc). In contrast, model-based approach offers greater flexibility by providing means for evaluation with a wide range of configuration parameters in a practical manner. Therefore, the proposal aims at satisfying the following objective:
- Objective 3 - provision of a general-purpose methodology for model-based performance evaluation of database replication protocols.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A database replication protocol based on the use of diverse Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has been developed by the researchers at the Centre for Software Reliability at City University London. This protocol is referred to as DivRep. The findings of the project could confirm our intuition that DivRep is characterized with good performance. That result will be a significant justification towards building a fully functional diverse database replication solution (referred colloquially in CSR as DivSQL), which requires several other components apart from the replication protocol DivRep. Instigating the development of DivSQL and turning it into a hi-tech software product could, in turn, have far-reaching effects: it will open new employment opportunities for highly skilled personnel (particularly in software development field) and, more generally, will improve the competitiveness of the UK economy. As a result, the society as a whole will benefit financially from the success of the project and so will the institution (City University London).
CSR has invested considerably, mainly through funding from the City University London, in setting an Innovation vision and corresponding strategy. The main pilot project considered as part of the Innovation initiative at CSR is commercialisation of DivSQL. CSR team has been negotiating different commercialisation alternatives with the University's Technology Transfer team; the most viable of which is a set-up of a spin-off company. Our DivRep replication protocol is at the heart of DivSQL, and the project results would feed back directly to the plans for DivSQL development; e.g., they would help us assess DivSQL performance and identify necessary changes to be made. Nevertheless, the results obtained in the project are not meant to be self-serving: any company interested in developing solutions for dependable database replication will benefit from the measurement results and model-based methodology for database replication assessment provided by this project.
The increasing reliance on IT systems by various businesses, of different sizes and from virtually all industrial sectors, is exemplified by the pervasive use of database software. Despite contributing to improved business productivity, these complex software packages do fail, occasionally with serious consequences, e.g. a corruption in Oracle database has left JPMorgan Chase online and mobile banking non-operational for more than 24 hours (http://www.banktech.com/articles/227700032). A part of the failures will manifest themselves as crashes and will be acted upon by system operators, but many will not be self-evident and will remain unnoticed, possibly for long periods of time, causing unknown damage to the system. It is the latter, more subtle, type of failures that diverse database protocols, including our DivRep, protect against and as such aid business continuity. Early adoption of this disruptive technology can be a valuable asset of UK businesses in a long run. If the adoption materializes, the results from this project will help system designers in making informed decision if, and when, to deploy diversity: the detailed analysis of the cost of diverse redundancy for database replication protocols (in terms of performance overhead) will be a valuable contribution in that respect.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit by Prof Ricardo Jimenez-Peris, Technical University of Madrid, Spain.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72260292-C574-410A-90A5-61142FC7D652</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our research team presented the project goals and the findings available at the time to Prof Jimenez-Peris.

The approach focuses on the evaluation of performance, the main non-functional characteristic of database replication protocols. It can be extended to cover evaluation of other non-functional properties, such as reliability.

In addition, we have performed extensive performance testing of our replication protocol - DivRep: both using the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; systems (e.g. database management servers PostgreSQL and Firebird), as well as the newly developed model-based approach.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Extending the approach and the tool support to cover the evaluation of dependability characteristics, such as reliability, is a promising future work.

Further evaluation and validation of the methodology and the tool support would be beneficial (e.g. using different replication protocols).

We have used the tool to mainly evaluate our own database replication protocol (DivRep). Thus using the approach and the software to evaluate different protocols would strengthen our confidence in their quality, and improve on the technology readiness level of the software.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BC18E283-8CC3-49F8-9328-91DAFA938DB7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d01f1cc5344.21973435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have performed extensive performance evaluation of our replication protocol - DivRep.
This has been done in two ways:

The model has been validated using the data obtained from the measurements with real systems (e.g. open-source database servers: PostgreSQL and Firebird, and the implementation of our database replication protocol DivRep).

Performance evaluation via stochastic modelling has a number of advantages in comparison with the empirical performance measurements, among them:
- Saving on ICT infrastructure costs and time on measurement. In our own experience, performance measurement takes a lot of time especially if performance needs to be measured in a wide range of conditions (varying workload, load, size of the data processed by the tested system, hardware constraints, etc.); 
- Evaluating performance variability, i.e. performance is evaluated not as a single number (e.g. throughput), but as a distribution of the measure of interest. This will take very extensive effort in order to get high confidence in the results. Stochastic models may offer dramatic changes in these circumstances;
- Extrapolating from observed measurements to different operational environments (e.g. higher load) is difficult; performance does not scale linearly. This task is relatively easy to solve with stochastic models although the models should be sufficiently accurate in order to preserve the ranking between competing products in the new environment. Making sure that models provide this property is an important part of validation.
- Replication protocols - which one to choose. Being able to compare the replication protocols at higher level of abstraction (eliminating the limitations of a particular implementation) is useful before one commits to a particular replication protocol. Typically, new protocols are compared with the performance of a single product, but rarely two competing replication protocols can be measured without the comparison being affected by the quality of the particular implementations. The ranking of the products may reflect the quality of the implementations, not the quality, lack thereof, of the available replication solutions.

N.B. We have developed software that implements this conceptual model. The software is based on the Mobius tool distributed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the USA. (please see the associated entry in the 'Software and Technical Products' category).</gtr:description><gtr:id>F673CE10-D667-4817-B087-71AE104F6891</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464a551d42af2.57967718</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A conceptual model for probabilistic, model-based performance evaluation of database replication protocols</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The software we developed implements our conceptual, probabilistic model for performance evaluation of database replication protocols (please see the associated entry in the category Research Databases and Models). We have used the software to measure the performance of DivRep - a database replication protocol developed in the Centre for Software Reliability (CSR) at the City University London.
