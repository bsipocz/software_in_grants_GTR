Given the importance of parental time inputs for a child?s development and the importance of intergenerational transmission of human capital in explaining children?s later life outcomes (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006; Cunha and Heckman 2010), understanding how potential inequalities in children?s resources based on their parents? educational levels are evolving is crucial from a child development perspective and for policies aimed at reducing inequality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The multi-disciplinary nature of this research means that it necessarily has to harness and combine different disciplinary perspectives.The chosen approach here is a multivariate regression analysis, which is commonly used in both the sociological and economics literature.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- Who will benefit from it?
This work is intended to benefit a range of academic and non-academic users. Because this will be the first project of its kind in the UK and, to the principal investigator's knowledge, elsewhere, and because the project will include cross-national comparisons, users include not only those from the UK, but also from Europe, North America, and other developed countries. Nonacademic users include civil servants and policy advisor bodies. The principal investigator will exploit her close contacts with Government departments such as the partnerships team in the Cabinet Office, which coordinate a range of policies across government. The Treasury will also be contacted because of its interest in well-being and supporting communities. The principal investigator will also maintain close links to the Department of Communities and Local Government and the Department of Education, which are the two Departments with prime responsibility for children's well-being. The principal investigator will also develop a list of key potential contacts in other Government departments, and MPs with an interest in this field. In addition to the All Party Parliamentary Groups in Parliament on the Economics of Wellbeing, there are other cross party groups on education, equalities and children, which constitute audiences the principal investigator will want to inform about the results of the project.

Other interest groups include Child Poverty Action Group, 4 Children, Day care trust, Gingerbread, Working Families, the Women's Budget Group (where the principal investigator is a member), and the Family and Parenting Institute; health professionals interested in the effect of parental time with children and child development, and parent's interest groups interested in how to make it possible for families to work and care for their children. Unions and workers representatives will also benefit from the findings in this research, to the extent that the type of job and the amount of work hours matter for reconciling family and work responsibilities, including childcare. 

- How will they benefit from the work?
Policy makers will benefit from this work because the findings will improve our understanding of whether and why children born to parents with different educational attainments receive different parental time investments, which will have implications for policies designed to increase equality of opportunities early in life and to reduce inequality later in life. Employees and families, and organisations that represent them, will benefit from the research by learning new information about how parental time with children differs by parental educational background. This information should allow them to make informed parenting choices.

- What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?
The findings of the project will be publicised to the general public and other interest groups through a dedicated section of the School of Business and Management website, which will be updated as the project develops. Key findings will be communicated in press releases to QM well-established network of media contacts, and non-technical summaries will be published in the School's Newsletter. The principal investigator will seek opportunities to offer briefings and to present our findings in a policy context and to demonstrate their policy relevance to Government Departments, MPs with an interest in this field, and other interest groups. The principal investigator will be holding a 1-day workshop at the end of the project where the main results of the project will be presented to policy makers and interest groups alike. The principal investigator will set up an advisory group This group will meet twice during the life of the project, once at the beginning where the project design will be discussed and the project impact plan put in place, and one at the end to discuss findings and write a report.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75235</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic Advisory Board Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0191FE62-3587-4BC1-B2E7-D93593EB1469</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and discussion of research preliminary outcomes.

This session introduced some of the issues to be confronted when studying social diversity and population dynamics using large and complex survey data sets. Quantitative methods were discussed. Methods span from regression analysis across countries and over time (which are used to identify changes in family life in the UK and elsewhere) to quasi-experimental estimation techniques (which are used to evaluate causal effects from social policies). The session also discussed opportunities, challenges and practicalities of existing data sources to suit research questions on family dynamics in the UK.

Crucially differences in parental time across parents with different educational backgrounds may have direct implications on inequality. 
Policy makers have benefited from this work because the findings improved our understanding of how access to university affects parental time for parents with different socio-economic status. This can have implications for policies designed to increase access to less well-off children. 
Possible measures include placing greater emphasis on admission criteria that parents cannot directly influence and providing less-educated parents with the right information and tools about the admission process during their child's secondary school years. The UK admissions system places weight on examination results and prior academic performance. Targeted measures designed to boost school performance for children from less-advantaged families, such as providing after-school homework clubs, could help. 

Our study shows that parents with college degrees spent more time on educational activities with their children during a period when competition for university places was increasing,&amp;quot; says Professor Sevilla. &amp;quot;This has important implications for policies aimed at reducing inequality and ensuring that children from less-educated parents are able to successfully compete in the university admission process. 
As planned in our original proposal, we engaged with audiences who might be interested in or benefit from our work and stablished strong links and networks at regional, national, and international level. We also developed a communication strategy to undertake impact in a co-ordinated and professional manner, identifying target audiences and outlining the channels and activities that helped us to engage effectively with stake holders. These activities are described within the &amp;quot;Engagement Activities&amp;quot; in Researchfish. 

As a result of the interest generated by this project, there was an article on ESRC magazine &amp;quot;Britain Now&amp;quot; about our research (as described under &amp;quot;Outputs&amp;quot; in Researchfish, which brings the findings to the attention of a wider public.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD6FBF23-2F5A-4BD2-9CC9-982BD46536B3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545285bcbb0c00.05421508</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We firstly document trends in parental time investments for college and non-college educated parents over the last five decades in the UK and compare those to those of other countries in the industrialised world, =&amp;gt; Trends in the Education Gradient: 



- We document increases in parental time investments in most countries. Parental time investments increased 30 min./day for mothers and 20 min./day for fathers.





- We document a positive education gradient: With respect to non-college educated parents, college-educated mothers devote between 5 more minutes per day (Canada and France), and 20-25 more minutes per day (Sweden, US) 

College-educated fathers devote about 10 more minutes in most countries (US 18, UK -3).





- Unlike in the US, trends in the education gradient vary across countries, and for fathers and mothers within a given country. We find that in contrast to previous findings for the United States, the difference between college-educated parents and lower educated parents with respect to time investments has not increased in all countries over this period. 



Mothers:

Increases: Netherlands and the US

Decreases: Australia, France, Norway

Constant: Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK.

Range: -17 min in France, +15 min in the US



Fathers:

Increases: Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the US

Decreases: Finland, France, Spain, the UK.

Constant: Italy, Norway

Range: -11 min in Finland, + 16 min in Canada and the US.

 



We secondly examine the main explanations offered by the literature for the sources of these differences in parental time investments. Using auxiliary micro-level data on safety concerns and parenting values, we rule out preference-based explanations as a possible mechanism explaining the differences in the trends in parental time with children for college and non-college educated parents. With the exception of the US, trends in children's homework-related activities are not consistent with the evolution of the education gradient in most countries, which suggests that differential trends in the returns to parental time investments for college-educated parents and non-college educated parents cannot explain changes in the education gradient. 



In the UK, o single hypothesis seems to adequately explain parental trends in education gradients (much easier to explain positive education gradients or general increases in childcare time)</gtr:description><gtr:id>058659DE-0C3A-4D20-91FB-23B91484FAC4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6489340343.037005776139da</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K003127/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
