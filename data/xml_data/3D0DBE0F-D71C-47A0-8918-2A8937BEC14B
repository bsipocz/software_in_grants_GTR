AD 1400 - 1532) met the challenge of appropriating and modifying the Andean landscape to enhance its productive capacity and political power so as to create the largest native state in the Americas. To address the relationship between landscape, site and symbol in the Andes we propose a trans-disciplinary study of a specific kind of Inca architectural construction known as the ushnu. Ushnu is a Quechua term that encompasses the idea of a restricted, sanctified space reserved for use by the Inca king and Incas-by-privilege. This concept found material expression in a hierarchy of forms ranging from conspicuous, stone-faced stepped pyramids and platforms located in the central plazas of regional administrative centres, to smaller constructions placed at prominent visible points in the landscape. When the Inca (or a provincial lord as his representative) stood on this platform with his retinue, he affirmed the supremacy of the Inca state and its divine authority to rule. The platforms were used as public stages to conduct ceremonies announcing the timing of planting and harvest within the agricultural calendar using prestigious objects such as qeros (drinking vessels made in metal, pottery and wood for toasting and libations). They were also used for redistributive rituals enacted as shows of public generosity to bind the people to their rulers and occasionally to make offerings of sets of miniature pottery vessels and metal figurines. Ushnus were therefore invested with profound symbolic significance and served as pragmatic instrument s of administrative control to regulate daily life and assert Inca supremacy over subject populations and resources. As focal elements in Inca political and sacred geography their distribution in the landscape offers a key to understanding how extraordinarily effective the Incas were in asserting control and incorporating new territories into their rapidly expanding empire.

Our goal is to understand the practical and symbolic principles underlying their construction, the rationale for their placement and function within the landscape, the activities that took place on them together with their associated artefact assemblages. The study will focus on the hinterland surrounding Vilcashuaman that once lay at the geographical centre of the Inca Empire in the Peruvian Central Highlands. Here, one of the most impressive and best preserved ushnus on the system of Inca Royal Roads (capac nan) marked the nexus between the main East-West road connecting the capital Cusco with the Pacific coast, and the great South-North highway linking the expanding northern frontier with the Inca heartland. In a 3 year programme (Jan. 2007 - Dec. 2009) to be undertaken in partnership with Peruvian collaborators, we will undertake survey, mapping, soil analysis and excavation of selected ushnus along two stretches of the highway and in the adjacent hinterland. We will assess site locations in relation to site catchment resources such agricultural potential, springs, irrigation, and also to other cultural features including the main arterial highway and tambos (way stations) and storage facilities as well as ancillary roads and paths. Ethnographic work with local communities and ethno-historical research will provide key insights into the ways in which ushnus were and are used and understood. We will be paying particular attention to ushnu view-sheds and inter-site visibility in order to reveal aspects of Inca cognition and relationship to the landscape that lie outside conventional western rules. The fieldwork and laboratory analysis will proceed in parallel with a study of the British Museum's Andean collections and together will contribute to innovative ways of contextualising and understanding the Inca collections, culminating in the new gallery devoted to Andean civilisation and opening in 2009. The outcomes will represent a substantial and original contribution to current theorising and practice in landscape studies within the framework of a non-western cosmology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160799</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A small exhibition was erected at the British Museum linked to the AHRC funded project; the exhibition displayed the key elements, from an archaeological perspective, of the ushnu.</gtr:description><gtr:id>56E06080-0D44-4241-BA4B-5CB0CA949A4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impact is difficult to quantify but certainly would have been visited by large numbers of visitors to the British Museum on an annual basis.

Our study has led to new insights into the processes that underpin archaic state formation in the Andes. The Incas drew upon the concept of a sacred central place (the ushnu), which has been deeply embedded in Andean cultural practice for at least 2000 years. Our study reveals for the first time how the Incas transposed the 'ushnu platform' (a stepped construction that marked this sacred place) to a radically different altiplano setting and deployed it as an innovative and powerful new instrument of statecraft. We demonstrate the meaning and function of these isolated high-altitude platforms by using a multi-disciplinary approach incorporating archaeological, ethnohistorical and ethnographical methods. The Incas used the platform as a potent symbol of religious and political authority in their capital Cusco, and positioning each new construction at significant boundaries on the margins of the expanding empire, to effectively define and proclaim their growing imperial hegemony. Our numerically based GIS analysis shows that these platforms generally command prominent views of the surrounding landscape, in particular clear visibility of the snow-clad peaks that were worshiped as mountain deities (wamanis). We have shown how they served a vital role in integrating new subject populations into Inca political economy and their local deities into the overarching state religion. The geoarchaeological evidence, supported by ethnohistorical (e.g. Polo de Ondegardo) data, indicates that the regular, ordered nature of each construction together with the high degree of control entailed in orchestrating the layering and content of the platform fills that we have documented provide incontrovertible evidence of the coordination and supervision of local labour in service to the Inca state. The detailed mapping of related cultural features ranging from sayhuas, huancas and chulpas (cairns, way markers and burial structures) indicate that these were all ancient and essential elements in cognizing and marking the landscape. All found new salience within the expanding system of Inca roads as a means of consolidating control of these newly conquered territories and incorporating their productive capacity to meet state ordained needs. At one platform we have traced a narrow shaft penetrating the fill to a basin excavated in the bedrock beneath where a carefully placed deposit of three revered Inca 'stone ancestors' was discovered in-situ. This unprecedented find documents for the first time the positioning of the ushnu shaft within the body of the platform itself, which, along with the unusual offering, represents a potent projection of state power. Complementary ethnographic research has provided evidence for the continued symbolic use of ushnus, involving offerings of coca leaves, candles, flowers, liquor and the construction of cairns. We have also demonstrated the validity of combining a range of methods and approaches to understanding the relationships between landscape and environment in the Andes. Building on the available ethnohistorical records and interviews with high altitude pastoralists, the project has proven the potential for combining social science, physical science and historical research methods in understanding natural and cultural landscapes. Finally, in addition to highlighting the significance of the findings through academic output, our collaboration with the British Museum (e.g. gallery displays, website and international conference) has played a key role in actively engaging and educating the public in the research process and outcomes. 



Secondary:

Ethnohistoric research drawing upon sources such as Betanzos, Cieza de Leon and Guaman Poma, as well as recent anthropological work by Larry Coben and Jerry Moore, have confirmed the use of the ushnu platforms as 'stages' for public performance and display featuring both speech and music. The ethnohistoric accounts emphasise the highly choreographed nature of the ritual performances using instruments and voice. This prompted us to think how we might devise systematic tests to show how the ushnu platforms might have served to project sound. Following discussions with Henry Stobart (Senior Lecturer, Department of Music, Royal Holloway University of London), we developed a methodology for reconstructing the 'soundscape' at selected sites (n=14). In the field, a standard sound intensity-measuring device was used for measuring sound levels in decibels. For each of the sites, we measured sound levels at incremental distances of 10m from the centre of all four faces of each structure up to the point where levels dropped below 40dB (below this level sound and speech were increasingly difficult to hear and understand), and generated 'isobel' maps. Sound sources used were: (1) the human voice; (2) a drum, and (3) an Andean shell trumpet known as a 'pututu', and we re-tested sites over several days. We established that for a sound source to be heard, the source needed to be positioned on the 'front' edge of the platform facing the audience, rather than the centre. Furthermore, it quickly became apparent that audibility was reduced significantly due to wind level increasing during the afternoon. It is likely therefore that the sites would have been most effective for projecting speech and music. The 40dB cut off level for speech data was most commonly at c. 50m from the platform wall face, and usually from only one of the four faces. Greater distances were occasionally recorded of between 100-120m, with an isolated example of 180m. There was one location, Usqunta, a very important Late Intermediate and Late Horizon pilgrimage site, where the results were dramatically different. Two platforms had been constructed on a level plain but with the local landscape morphology providing natural reflective surfaces. The distinctive sound of the shell trumpet , in particular, was very effective, and proved audible at distances of over 500m. The data gathered have helped shape our understanding of how the sites were probably used for public performances.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The text below provides an indication of the how the research HAS been used, and COULD be used to inform other research groups with respect to a wider ranging IMPACT strategy. The research project team acknowledged from the outset the importance of public dissemination of the results of the multi-disciplinary dataset, enabling us to convey the clear social and economic benefits of the research. Discussion with specialists in the fields of cartography, ICT and museum studies, and drawing upon the results of recent NERC/ESRC funded PhD research supervised by Branch, led to agreement that communication of the results should fall into three categories. (1) Explain the process of research (the 'Why' and 'How'), enabling the public to 'drill down' to explore specific techniques, interrogate results, provide feedback and source further information. (2) Ensure that local communities in Peru that participated in the research should benefit from the findings, enabling them to learn more about their heritage and environment. (3) Provide a unique visual experience of the ushnus, highlighting the linkages between their landscape and environmental context, and symbolic and administrative importance. We achieved this by the creation of three highly creative resources. (a) A project website housed at the British Museum (http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects.aspx). (b) A new display case in the Wellcome Gallery at the British Museum, which included artefacts and images drawn from the Museum's own collections and donations from colleagues in the UK and Peru. (c) Poster banners forming the centrepiece of a portable display in Peru permitting dissemination of the principal outcomes of the project to rural communities around the Ayacucho Basin with whom we had contact in the course of conducting the fieldwork. This plays an essential role in validating traditional belief and practice among the rural populace and affirming a sense of identity and pride in local knowledge and lore. In addition to the above, a broad interested public attended the 2008 Lima conference and we are now addressing the need to assure wider publicity about the project in the popular media.
