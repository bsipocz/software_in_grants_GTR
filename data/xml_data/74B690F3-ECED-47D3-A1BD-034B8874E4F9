The proposed Knowledge Exchange workshop brings together the expertise of Manchester academics and Hay Group consultants in dialogue with senior human resources staff and non executive directors from FTSE 100 and 250 companies. Jointly developed presentations, by academics and consultants, aim to open up a broader perspective on issues usually discussed at firm level, as a matter of relating pay to performance in one company with or without comparators. &lt;br />How do large rewards for top executives feed broader patterns of increasing wealth and income inequalities? What are the unintended consequences of action at individual firm level, and can shareholder value be delivered and rewarded, without frustrating stakeholder expectations? Against this broader background, the workshop will continue the debate regarding how managers are and should be incentivised.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>If we aim to break down silos, we do not aim for the kind of success which Lew Platt dreamt of when he famously said, &amp;quot;If HP knew what HP knows, we would be three times as profitable.&amp;quot; But we aim to deliver relevant insights and build network relations which would enthuse some participants to work together afterwards, on issues relevant to their organisations.
 
As already noted, with CRESC academics, the aim is one new knowledge exchange partnership with a leading corporate. With the Hay Group Consultants, on the demand side, the aim is to persuade two or three corporates; (a) to choose Hay consulting for the first time or (b) to buy a broader range of offerings on organisational success from Hay. On the supply side, the aim is to add some insights which would help Hay differentiate its offerings in a world where, many products from the major consultancies are commoditised, and would help sustain Hay's commitment to a model of intelligent consultancy which, offers challenging and relevant questions rather than endorses whatever the client wants to do.

We recognise the ESRC prioritises the importance of building continuing relations between academic researchers and for profit corporates but, do not want to over promise on this count. On management practice, we would not pretend to be teaching best practice on issues like supply chain management. But, we would argue that management needs to consider broader issues of distribution through job creation inside and outside the national economy, the politics of supply chain power for producers and the role of stock market pressure for growth and returns. The result should be clearer understanding of unintended consequences and chain issues arising from success at one point; and we can test reaction with a questionnaire. We cannot predict how corporate managers will respond but, we would expect them to be drawn into closer relations with CRESC academics and Hay consultants, so that the measures of success for these two groups would capture success with managers. We would also emphasise that, what we are doing in the workshops is new and untried so that there is some risk of failing to meet objectives. In which case, our final report would reflect on the conditions of unsuccess and how we (or others) might do things differently another time.

The media gives us another pathway to a broader and more diffuse impact on academics and non academics. Since autumn 2009, CRESC has produced a series of high profile public interest reports on banking reform, on London as a city state, on rebalancing manufacturing and also on train building (see www.cresc.ac.uk). This has given us unique media contacts, because the list of national journalists who know our work and who have written enthusiastically about CRESC reports includes; Larry Elliot and Aditya Chakrabortty of the Guardian, Heather Stewart of the Observer, Tony Jackson of the Financial Times, Ruth Sunderland and Alex Brummer of the Daily Mail and Simon Caulkin (formerly of the Observer). 

We would aim to interest journalists by writing up the empirical exhibits and the roundtable discussion in a bright and lively 5-7000 word report, in the style of previous CRESC public interest reports. If we can convey a sense of novelty, then the media will persuade newspaper readers to download from the CRESC website. And this gives us another pathway to impact, as we can then make contact with other academic and non academic groups, as we have been doing with CRESC work on manufacturing and public procurement. Through this outer circle, we can begin to put together interesting coalitions for change, as we have been doing already with our work on train building where there has been rapid change in public thinking about procurement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4997</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshops on Shareholder Value and Corporate Social Responsibility</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>17D7A05A-E2B1-4C00-AFE1-99091DF67E11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop slides</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6838172298.7053662ab27590</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020680/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
