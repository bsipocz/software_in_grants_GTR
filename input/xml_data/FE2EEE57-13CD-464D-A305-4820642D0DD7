Designs of this kind have applications in areas as diverse as Semiconductor Engineering, Medical Research, Psychometric Studies and Horticultural Trials. Estimability restrictions in such designs arise from sources, including:1) Confounding factorial effects with block effects resulting from blocking; a tactic frequently employed to eliminate sources of systematic variation;2) Aliasing of factorial effects to form a design of manageable size;3) Observation loss during experimentation.Established good design practice involves arranging the design to take account of the first two sources of in a systematic way. Various authors give approaches for planning factorial experiments which achieve this.Little work has been done to take account of the third cause of estimability restrictions. Observation loss during experimentation is common. With factorial experiments it may happen that some combinations of factor levels prove to be infeasible. Alternatively, data may be lost during an experiment because of damaged experimental units, for example silicon wafers may break in semiconductor tests. In any experimental situation, data may be lost due to human error; a value may not be recorded or an incorrect treatment combination may be applied to an experimental unit.Observation loss in full or fractional factorial experiments is unplanned and generally unpredictable. One very severe consequence is that observation loss can cause an experimental design to become disconnected. If this occurs then the estimability capabilities of the design will be greatly reduced. Typically, few if any factorial effects will be estimable from a disconnected experiment. This may mean that the substantial investment in man-power and experimental resources is wholly wasted. Even highly efficient designs are vulnerable to becoming disconnected through observation loss. There is an overwhelming case for further research into the mechanisms by which observation loss results in design disconnectivity.A requirement in this research area is to establish a technique by which the user is warned of a vulnerable design prior to experimentation to aid in design choice. This problem has received little attention in the methodological Statistics literature. It is common practice to select a design under the supposition that a design with optimal properties at the onset of the experiment will still be a good design if observations are lost or classified as unreliable during the experiment. The aim of the research is threefold:1) To extend theoretical results that the Principal Investigator has obtained relating to estimability capabilities of block designs and row-column designs to encompass designs with a factorial treatment structure. Results should enable the identification of estimability restrictions, subject to assumptions regarding which factorial effects are assumed to be negligible. This theory will be used to develop a mechanism to warn a practitioner of a vulnerable design. 2) Investigation of how different types of observation loss affect the vulnerability of a design to becoming disconnected. Random observation loss arises, for example, if a run is defective or if an observation is lost due to human error. Non-random observation loss, occurs, for example, if interaction between two factors results in a high probability of observation loss when a particular combination of levels of these factors is used in an experiment.3) The development of software to determine the vulnerability of a given factorial design to becoming disconnected through observation loss.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F035470/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
