Current standard treatment depends on the grade (or aggressiveness) of the tumour but generally involves surgery and radiotherapy. The MRC CTU designs and carries out clinical trials aimed at evaluating new treatments which may improve the quality and/or duration of survival of these patients. As some types of brain tumour are relatively uncommon, most trials we conduct are international collaborations. In all cases, we compare a group of patients who receive the best current standard treatment with one or more groups receiving investigational treatments. Patients are allocated to a treatment group at random, to ensure that the types of patients receiving each treatment are as similar as possible. We can then attribute any differences in outcome to the treatment that they receive. At present, we are evaluating the role of chemotherapy in several settings.|In patients with low grade tumours, we are comparing radiotherapy (standard treatment) with chemotherapy using a drug called temozolomide. It is hoped that temozolomide will delay the time until the tumour re-grows and will also be associated with improved quality of life.|In patients with more aggressive (grade III) tumours, we are looking at whether three different ways of giving temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy can prolong patient survival over radiotherapy alone. One way is to give temozolomide at the same time as radiotherapy, the other is to give it for several months after radiotherapy; these two approaches can also be used together|Finally in patients who have had a recurrence of a previously diagnosed brain tumour, most patients will receive chemotherapy if they have not previously received it. In our BR12 trial we compared the standard chemotherapy a combination of 3 drugs - to temozolomide given in 2 different ways with the aim of prolonging survival (there is no cure at this stage) while maintaining good quality of life. We demonstrated that the standard way of giving temozolomide (for 5 days every 28 days) was, unexpectedly, better than the new way (for 21 days every 28 days, but at a lower dose) with respect to time to further growth of the tumour and the overall quality of life reported by the patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Approximately 4000 patients are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour every year in the UK. Many are incurable and consequently brain tumours account for 7% of the years of life lost from cancer before the age of 70, despite accounting for only 2% of all primary tumours.|MRC trials have focused mainly on the treatment of adult patients with malignant glioma. The results of our BR12 randomised trial in patients with recurrent glioma are now in press; this compared standard treatment combination chemotherapy with procarbazine, CCNU and vincristine (PCV) - with temozolomide (TMZ), given according to one of two schedules (5 days x 200mg/m2 vs 21 days x 100mg/m2 every 28 days until progression). This is the largest trial ever conducted in recurrent glioma, and while it showed no clear benefit to TMZ over PCV, the novel 21-day TMZ regimen was shown to be inferior to the conventional 5-day schedule, challenging the current rationale for increasing temozolomide dose intensity by prolonged scheduling.|Two prospective, international, randomised trials (BR13 and BR14) conducted in collaboration with the European Organiation for Research and Treament of Cancer (EORTC) are currenty recruiting patients with the MRC coordinating the UK intergroup collaboration. |Patients with low grade gliomas often receive no active treatment until they have symptoms of progressing tumour. At that point, radiotherapy is generally employed although there is increasing interest in using chemotherapy instead, in particular to avoid some of the late effects of radiotherapy on quality of life (QL) including cognitive function. The BR13 trial compares progression-free and overall survival and QL in patients treated with either radiotherapy or chemotherapy (temozolomide). The target accrual of registered patients was met in 2010; randomisation of registered patients will continue to 2011.|In grade IV tumours, an EORTC trial showed that the combination of radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, followed by a course of adjuvant temozolomide, significantly improved survival. However, the contributions of each aspect of treatment could not be teased out, and the results may not apply to lower grade tumours. BR14 examines both components in a 2x2 factorial design in patients with grade III gliomas, excluding those with 1p and 19q deletions. The primary outcome measure is survival. This trial is a collaboration between the UK (NCRI Brain Tumour Group and MRC CTU), the EORTC, the NCIC (Canada) and the RTOG and HUB groups in the US, and opened in the UK in 2010.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>312000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BR13 Collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>131B7518-0054-4EED-975E-3EC65F96CE5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration enabled the clinical trial to be completed, a database of the clinical data and accompanying sample collection to be developed and maintained, and initial results to be disseminated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54857f775d68c1.08268351-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The EORTC is the lead organisation and Sponsor for this trial, and oversees all participating international groups, delegating some responsibilities for the trial in the UK to the MRC CTU.
