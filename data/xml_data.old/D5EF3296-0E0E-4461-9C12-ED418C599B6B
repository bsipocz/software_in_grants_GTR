The study asks:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How are student aspirations formed over time?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; What influences the development of aspirations?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How are aspirations shaped by gender, social class and ethnicity?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>ASPIRES combined online surveys of a student cohort and repeat interviews with a sub-sample of students and their parents. Data were collected at three time points:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Year 6 (age 10/11)&lt;/li>

We also worked with a small group of London teachers to develop approaches for integrating STEM careers information into Key Stage 3 Science lessons.&lt;/p>

These are discussed in turn.

1. ASPIRES has shifted the STEM education policy debate in England

ASPIRES findings have significantly informed STEM education policy making in England. Our findings (particularly: the new concept of 'science capital' and how it links with aspirations; that 'interest is not enough' to promote STEM participation; that children's views of science as 'not for me' are formed early; the role of families in relation to children's science aspirations; patterns of youth aspirations; the general lack of public awareness about the transferability of science aspirations; and the role of gender and identity on aspirations) have shifted the parameters of science education policy debate. 

Our various findings and recommendations are widely cited, including in all major STEM participation government policy reports (e.g. 22/3/13, Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology (POST) Briefing ; 4/6/14, Women's Business Council report; 10/2013, Cabinet Office Review of Interventions for 16-24 Year Olds; BIS Review of Engineering Skills, conducted by the Chief Scientific Advisor Professor John Perkins). Findings have also informed specific policy documents, such as section 1.1.12 (providing STEM careers education from primary upwards) in the Liberal Democrats manifesto (9/ 2014) 'Expanding Opportunity, Unlocking potential'.

A specific example of ASPIRES impact on national policy is:
? Shaping the government's Your Life campaign. Evidence provided by Rebecca Rylatt (Science Team Leader, DfE, email: 20/11/2014) shows that: &amp;quot;Findings from ASPIRES have directly influenced the government's recent STEM policies. They have been a key driver to the DfE launching a cross government campaign to raise participation in maths and science. The Your Life campaign aims to raise awareness of the routes maths and science can lead to and to dispel myths/ change perceptions about science. The following ASPIRES findings underpin the rationale for the campaign: 
? 60% of young people agreeing that they would like a career in business v 15% in science;
? Families exert a considerable influence on students' aspirations; and
? Most young people and parents are not aware that science can lead to diverse post-16 routes.
Professor Archer also directly helped shape the focus of the campaign (using the ASPIRES project as a basis). In particular, she used the research findings to influence the early messaging and prototype materials that were produced:
? The early materials were quite gendered and the research suggested this was likely to reinforce stereotypes and potentially put people off, particularly girls. The initial posters were changed and the messaging is now designed to be aspirational in a gender neutral way.
? The research suggests that the campaign should address the wide range of options that STEM skills and subjects can lead to rather than focusing on engineering or traditional science careers - therefore this has become key to the campaign - it's now &amp;quot;Your Life, infinite possibilities&amp;quot;.
? Louise highlighted the value in showcasing successful business people rather than celebrities, this is illustrated by the Your Life ambassadors and the Chair, all of whom are highly successful people, many running businesses and who are aspirational because of what they do rather because of their status.'

ASPIRES findings have also significantly informed and impacted on the policy of STEM professional societies and third sector organisations. Specific examples include:
? At the British Council, Tim Slingsby (Advisor, Public Engagement in Science), describes the 'notable influence' of ASPIRES findings on his role. He regularly promotes the findings to policy-makers and education professionals from many different countries. The findings have allowed British Council-mediated policy dialogues to advance towards consideration of possible interventions and solutions, including a shift in the pedagogical approach to STEM subjects and incorporation of enrichment activities from the informal STEM education sector
? At the Institute of Physics, ASPIRES work has been described as a 'game changer' (Charles Tracy, Head of Education, email 25/1/14) impacting many areas of IOP work and practice, including shaping the content of the IOP's delivery work e.g. 'Its different for girls' workshop held at the Big Bang Fair 2012 and the IOP's suite of Girls and Physics delivery projects (including: Improving Gender Balance; that trials three different interventions across a group of 20 partner schools; the Drayson Girls in Physics Pilot Project and the Opening Doors project, a year-long project running from 2014 to 2015, working with two regional networks of schools to develop a code of practice on gender equity for schools).
? The Royal Institution's new ExpeRimental project (online resources aimed at promoting family engagement with science) is directly influenced and shaped by ASPIRES findings around the role of the family (Olympia Brown, Science Learning Manager, email 26 November 2014).
? The Royal Academy of Engineering reports that Aspires findings have played a very significant part in developing the thinking of the Royal Academy of Engineering towards promoting science education (Rhys Morgan, Director of Engineering &amp;amp; Education, 8/12/2014) including shaping the development of a major new re-branding and marketing campaign that the Academy is currently developing with major industry companies. In particular, the campaign is organised around the ASPIRES key messages of building science capital among parents and influencers and developing STEM careers awareness within school students. The implementation of the recommendations from the review has built on ASPIRES recommendations around the development of industry CPD programmes for teachers, to give STEM teachers greater insight into the role of science and engineering across a wide range of careers in a wide range of sectors, and foregrounds the ASPIRES message that STEM subjects need to open up career options rather than narrow them to specific destinations.
? The Royal Society of Chemistry explains that &amp;quot;The ASPIRES project has become the reference work for anyone engaging different audiences with the sciences in the UK. In particular, &amp;quot;Science capital&amp;quot; is now a key concept which informs any discussion around this area&amp;quot; (Dominic McDonald, 4/12/2014). 
? The Science Council's activities have been impacted in various ways by ASPIRES research findings, including: informing the strategy review for the Science Council's Careers from Science project and influenced the content of the Science Council's careers information for young people, teachers, parents and careers advisers including promotion of ASPIRES findings to teachers and careers advisers in order to encourage them to see the importance of careers awareness. ASPIRES findings also influenced the design of the Science Council's careers event (organised for the City of London for c.400 London school children) particularly in persuading them that the focus should be to showcase a wide range of careers rather than a 'science is fun' message. Science Council Director of Policy &amp;amp; Development, Nicola Hannam, confirms that ASPIRES research will continue to shape their current and forthcoming activities regarding promoting vocational routes in science and pathways to becoming a technician.
? The 2015 SCORE position paper on KS4 science is directly informed and shaped by the ASPIRES evidence and arguments around the problematic impact of multiple routes in KS4 science on widening participation in post-16 STEM.
? At Techniquest, Cardiff the SMT proposed a new strategy based on science capital and Aspires findings, which was agreed by the trustees, 12/11/2014.
? The Wellcome Trust report how they often use evidence from ASPIRES to inform their advocacy discussions with policy makers and when responding to consultations. For example, Wellcome have used evidence from ASPIRES to evidence the argument that students can start to make up their minds about science at primary school. ASPIRES findings have also shaped the content of Wellcome's online resource, Questions for Governors (www.questionsforgovernors.co.uk), and have shaped Wellcome's understanding of students' enjoyment of science, the impact of 'science capital' and data on student attitudes towards science at transition from key stage 2 to key stage 3, which have shaped Wellcome's work in primary science, including developing and evaluating an intensive programme of continuing professional development (CPD) for primary teachers who have weak science subject knowledge and low confidence in teaching science. 

Various other organisations also report that ASPIRES findings have informed their policy work, including the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) policy work around encouraging employer engagement with schools and young people (2/2013); ASPIRES evidence informed the direction of Pearson UK's strategic approach to investigating and implementing science-related work experience (17/9/ 2012); British Gas Brazil/UK STEM Education Exchange programme (11/10/2012).

Evidence of the reach of ASPIRES findings and impact on policy debate can also be seen in the fact that ASPIRES research is widely cited in third sector policy reports and position papers, including: the Science Council's 2012 consultation responses submitted to: DfE: Consultation on careers guidance for schools, sixth form colleges and further education institutions; House of Commons Education Committee: Careers Guidance for Young People Inquiry'; the IOP report 'It's Different for Girls - The influence of schools'; the Royal Society of Chemistry piece ('RSC says chemistry is not just for boys!' 9/5/2013); an IPPR report Women in Engineering: fixing the talent pipeline, 25/9/2014; ScienceGrrl's 'Through Both Eyes' report (31/3/2014); WiSE/ Network Rail report &amp;quot;Not for people like me? Under-represented groups in science, technology and engineering (11/2014); Nuffield Foundation, Science in the workplace review; WiSET report and presentation to BG to inform them about their diversity and CSR strategy (2013); WiSET review and recommendations to inform Equate Scotland (formerly Scottish Resource Centre for Women in SET) strategy on tackling occupational gender segregation within careers in STEM (2013) for Scottish Government.

2. ASPIRES findings have impacted on practice among STEM education enrichment organisations

A wide range of STEM education organisations are now doing new activities and/or have changed their existing activities to do them differently as a result of ASPIRES findings. Specific examples include:
? The Centre for Life, Newcastle: Andy Lloyd (Director of Special Projects) explains (10/12/2014) how ASPIRES findings - about the key influence that parents have on aspirations and engagement with science and that aspirations in science begin forming early - have strongly influenced the redesign of their exhibitions, which have moved from being primarily content-delivery vehicles to facilities designed to act upon the factors that influence interest and participation in science, as identified by ASPIRES. For instance, the Centre's Curiosity Zone opened in 2013 and was informed by ASPIRES findings. It seeks to promote curiosity and exploratory behaviour through open-ended, social activities to boost the family science capital of participants, and to increase individuals' own self-confidence around science. The Experiment Zone, due to open March 2015, will explore if visitors' sense of identification with science can be influenced by presenting an opportunity to &amp;quot;try out&amp;quot; the role of a lab scientist. Finally a new Brain-themed gallery, due to open 2016, will combine content-led exhibits with live research experiments and space for visiting researchers. This project will present a different type of scientist to the stereotype (drawing on key ASPIRES messages) and will focus on building science capital, individual self-confidence and identification with science rather than on teaching specific information (ie. marking a significant change in practice). Andy Lloyd also describes how &amp;quot;ASPIRES has given us an improved vocabulary&amp;quot; for explaining and understanding their work and says &amp;quot;we quote ASPIRES as one of our strongest influences in professional presentations of our work&amp;quot;.
? The Science faculty at City &amp;amp; Islington FE College are changing their professional practice in response to ASPIRES findings and devoted a whole day staff CPD to engaging with findings from the ASPIRES project and the formulation of forward strategy for change (email David Swinscoe, Strategic Director for Science, 13/11/14).
? EDT (the Engineering Development Trust), the largest provider of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) enrichment activities for UK youth, has changed their activities, targeting new demographic groups, and has accelerated the growth of particular programmes as a result of ASPIRES findings about the importance of: (i) 'science capital', (ii) the age at which science aspirations are formed and (iii) the important role of families in fostering and developing children's science aspirations. These changes now impact over 3,000 students per year. In particular, EDT now targets primary schools within their First Edition programme (previously working only with ages 11+), following the ASPIRES finding that science aspirations (and the notion that 'science is not for me') are formed earlier than previously thought. EDT also added a new target group for their First Edition programme, based on ASPIRES' findings around social class (e.g. Archer et al 2012) and the role played by 'science capital and has accelerated the growth of their STEM Family Challenges (SFC) programme (activities aimed at family groups, rather than just individual students) on the basis of ASPIRES findings. They have also targeted primary schools and families with their Great Bumblebee Discovery citizen science project, drawing again on ASPIRES research (as evidenced by direct ASPIRES quotes in their original project pitch).
? The Education and Employers Taskforce have used ASPIRES findings to shape their Inspiring the Future national campaign and their Primary Futures national campaign (email, 13/11/2014 from Nick Chambers, Director, Education &amp;amp; Employers Taskforce).
? The Education programme at the Francis Crick Institute has been heavily influenced by ASPIRES findings (Clare Davy, Education Officer, 9/12/ 2014). Their new programme reflects some key ASPIRES findings including: beginning interventions early (with primary aged children); reinforcing young people's belief in their potential future in science, providing a range of science-themed activities yearly throughout their school-lives; a strong focus of FCI activities will be show-casing the range of careers available with science qualifications, and promoting both highly academic and more vocational routes into work. The Education programme will be complemented by Public Engagement and Community programmes that will provide science capital to the families of the young people. FCI have chosen to initially pilot their work across the London borough of Camden, and particularly with the minority groups identified by ASPIRES. They are seeking to evaluate their programmes to test whether intervention leads to increased science capital. 
? The Nuffield Foundation have developed new materials that draw on ASPIRES findings. Nuffield's Practical work for learning project devoted one of its three strands to science in the workspace ,which integrates practical activities with a careers element within science lessons. ASPIRES work also directly informs two of the key recommendations cited by a Nuffield Foundation research review of science in the workplace, namely that intervention needs to happen early (i.e. KS3 and earlier) and needs to involve parents/guardians.
? The Royal Society of Chemistry has used the ASPIRES findings to inform the development of various programmes of work, such as the &amp;quot;Chemistry for All&amp;quot; research project into Widening Participation programmes. The RSC has also used ASPIRES work as a jumping off point for a project in collaboration with the Science Museum Group which will explore methodologies to engage adults with low socio-economic status. ASPIRES constitutes one of the core pieces of evidence which the RSC have used to justify the recent extension of their intervention work into Primary age groups.
? The Science Opens Doors project, conducted by the Worshipful Company of Horners: This project, directly inspired by ASPIRES findings, is being conducted in London schools and focuses on building family science capital and providing information about careers from science (foregrounding the ASPIRES message that science keeps options open).
? TeachFirst: The ASPIRES '10 science facts and fictions' report was added to the TeachFirst Summer Institute curriculum (2012) and is required reading for c.1000 TeachFirst teachers each summer.
? The Wellcome Trust Monitor survey is now using the ASPIRES concept of 'science capital' to inform the next wave of the Monitor which will focus on adult respondents. 
? WiSET (Women in Science, Engineering and Technology) reports being significantly impacted by ASPIRES since its start (Pat Morton, Director, WiSET, 10/12/2014), including the development of its STEM Careers online module (aimed at careers professionals and STEM subject teachers), which includes references to ASPIRES research; and their STEM equality and diversity toolkit , a resource for careers professionals and STEM Teachers , which also draws on the work of ASPIRES, particularly findings around increasing access to science for girls. They have also drawn on ASPIRES work to shape a series of workshops for existing and new University Technical Colleges (2014) aimed at widening access for girls (funded by RAEng and Baker Dearing) in collaboration with the WISE Campaign. The workshop includes coverage of the ASPIRES findings and recommendations to help governors, tutors and employers take action in marketing, recruitment and delivery.


The impact of ASPIRES on public debate around STEM participation can also be evidenced by media coverage of the project findings:

We hope that our findings will be used by STEM educational and delivery organisations to influence the nature of their offer - for instance, to focus on primary-aged students rather than just secondary; to promote messages around the transferability of science and careers from science (rather than just promoting messages about STEM careers per se); to build science c</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D88420B4-B266-478E-8F06-38B5010EC252</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-918763532.2276163b2f074ce</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/aspires/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4106116E-133E-44D2-8FAB-4C974D8C50C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Not girly, not sexy, not glamorous': primary school girls' and parents' constructions of science aspirations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Pedagogy, Culture &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970"><gtr:id>32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Archer L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9cf9cf713d00</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76F4991C-77DE-4B39-8CE0-C6DCCAED55AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nerdy, Brainy and Normal: Children's and Parents' Constructions of Those Who Are Highly Engaged with Science</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Science Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9ca76ccdd0eb8d8fa4b6a220dddb1094"><gtr:id>9ca76ccdd0eb8d8fa4b6a220dddb1094</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>DeWitt J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf8df8dbf346f4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>68DBA4F9-C2DC-47B7-8428-C04B286D2836</gtr:id><gtr:title>'It didn't really change my opinion': exploring what works, what doesn't and why in a school science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers intervention</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Science &amp; Technological Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970"><gtr:id>32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Archer L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf99f9969cc804</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05733B61-49E5-435D-B78D-264FC1612B0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Balancing acts'': Elementary school girls' negotiations of femininity, achievement, and science</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970"><gtr:id>32d0065af1a8ed9dfa47c43a8e754970</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Archer L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf8bf8ba24efa3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>881A422C-829B-47B0-B82C-346167C451CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>HIGH ASPIRATIONS BUT LOW PROGRESSION: THE SCIENCE ASPIRATIONS-CAREERS PARADOX AMONGST MINORITY ETHNIC STUDENTS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9ca76ccdd0eb8d8fa4b6a220dddb1094"><gtr:id>9ca76ccdd0eb8d8fa4b6a220dddb1094</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>DeWitt J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf8df8d2358594</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5FFA2F5-1CD4-4155-9229-48870F014182</gtr:id><gtr:title>What shapes children's science and career aspirations age 10-13?
