mass industry sectors, especially automotive, aerospace and medical. Their use is growing rapidly in preference to
conventional casting because the process produces parts in the precise final shape required with little or no machining
requirement combined with fine grained (nano-micro scale), homegeneous microstructures of enhanced strength. However
there is a lack of production quality control as little in-line inspection is performed. End-of-line inspection, not often
performed, leads to scrapping of 6-8% of components yet fails to detect micro sized defects, which can grow in service to
produce major in service failures and recalls. THE PROJECT VISION is an in-line quality control system (QUALINET) using
3D microfocus x ray imaging with AUTOMATION INNOVATIONS (A) Detection and characterization of volume and surface
micro-scale defects at the pre and post sintering stages. (B) Decision making: (i) component acceptance or (ii) send for recycling or (iii) send with a prescription for defect healing treatment. QUALINET will eliminate waste, increasing line
production, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, all by 8%. The benefit will be optimal for state of the art
PM component lines including additive manufacturing by laser deposition, nano-powders and injection moulding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WITHIN THE CONSORTIUM: Creation of 180 jobs assuming one job per &amp;pound;100kpa of turnover.
OUTSIDE THE CONSORTIUM: (1) Creation of 90 further jobs along the supply chain to the consortium assuming a 50%
added value along the chain. (2) ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR PM PLANT OPERATORS: Adding an O&amp;amp;M cost of
&amp;pound;13.5kpa it should last the plant life, typically 20 years and thus the cost of the system (CAPEX +OPEX) is &amp;pound;257kpa. Global
production of PM components amounts to &amp;pound;1m tonnes pa, valued at &amp;pound;2k per tonne. Assuming some 400 PM component
production plants globally (including MIM and additive manufacture) with an average of 8 lines per plant the production is
312 tonnes pa valued at average of &amp;pound;620kpa per line (with high value products as at LCT the turnover is &amp;pound;1.5m per line pa)
and the product wastage is 0.08 x &amp;pound;620k ~&amp;pound;50k pa per line. One system, shared between all lines in one plant (typically 8)
can thus save up to &amp;pound;375k per plant pa after discounting the system cost. The 5 year operator savings from the average 18
systems pa sold directly by the partners = &amp;pound;375k x 18 x (5+4+3+2+1) = &amp;pound;102m. If potential licensee sales are taken into
account the saving increases to &amp;pound;340. If the sales within the EEA are taken to be proportional to the EEA share of the
global PM market (37% from Q2 [REF 1], the EEA 5 year savings would be 0.37 x &amp;pound;340 = &amp;pound;126m and the 5 year profits of
the EEA licensees and the partnership, are taken at a similar percentage, would be (from Q2) ~ (&amp;pound;26m +&amp;pound;14.1m), ignoring
secondary markets but including maintenance services and partner royalties. EEA 5 year ROI would be (&amp;pound;126 +&amp;pound;26m
+&amp;pound;14.1)/&amp;pound;1.5m = 111:1 and sustainable thereafter at ~ 55:1 pa. For the UK with about 50% of the EEA PM market, the ROI
~ 28:1 pa. Global economic benefits from wide acceptance of the technology, assuming 400 plants worldwide, would be
400 x &amp;pound;388kpa = &amp;pound;155mpa. GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL /SOCIAL BENEFITS (i) An ~ 8% reduction in plant energy
consumption and 8% less pollution. (ii) Avoidance of major product re-call costs, which improves
public confidence in PM reliant product. Greater acceptance of additive manufacture, still relatively a cottage industry.

As a result it is expected that the use of refurbished tooling becomes more common and a trusted and viable alternative for oil and gas companies instead of investing in new equipment at the first place. This results significant saving in raw materials and tooling costs for the industry players. 

The developed technique - once adopted - will further reduce the need for conventional, destructive quality control that is based on sampling and disposal or re-manufacturing of finished products and lengthy laboratory testing. This can reduce the lead time and cost of manufacturing and attract more business for such refurbishing companies as Laser Cladding Technologies Ltd. 

The environmental impact is non negligible as an In-line inspection process with such quality would allow the reduction of waste generated by the manufacturing by identifying defects very early and feeding that back into the production in order to continuously control and improve the process.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ACFAD7CB-EB48-49F5-A41F-9C54FABED6D5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d702bfac9a14.77395870</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A highly accurate and efficient quality assurance system was developed using X-ray Computed tomography for Non-destructive testing of tool manufacturing for the oil and gas industry. The technology is used for tool refurbishment is called laser cladding. This technology enables the refurbishment of used drilling bits and other tools to a near new quality grade by building up worn areas layer by layer. However the technology has its inherent difficulties. Through laser cladding there are typical defects like porosity, cracks and delamination may remain in the material. This may change the material properties of the finished component considerably. However, there is a conventional way of quality control in place, based on part sampling and metallurgy, it is time consuming and can only provide partial information. Whilst the new technique enables manufacturers to achieve full, 100% volume, coverage in scanning with high accuracy in the whole range of technology specific defects.

In QualiNet, algorithms have been developed to compare 3D reconstructed images of produced pieces with a reference healthy one. The algorithms apply subtraction, filtering and segmentation to automatically detect defects in the cladding process. These algorithms could be used for the QualiNet systems but could be applied to any CT-scan after reconstruction.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project delivered two technologies:

- Low cost CT-scan technology for In-Line inspection of a manufacturing process such as cladding

- Algorithms for defect detection of CT-scans after reconstruction. These algorithms could be used in combination with the system mentioned above or could be used on any 3D reconstruction data from competitor computed tomography</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D982CEE9-B7C1-48A8-A946-FE7EE14039EC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d70303914671.96309027</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.qualinet-project.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9BAB5703-C14D-4C40-8784-DA6FCCF100E6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Automated Defect Recognition as a Critical Element of a Three Dimensional X-ray Computed Tomography Imaging-Based Smart Non-Destructive Testing Technique in Additive Manufacturing of Near Net-Shape Parts</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6e9939f2770a4338b2faaee66a1c50bb"><gtr:id>6e9939f2770a4338b2faaee66a1c50bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Szabo I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a994db36ade85.83293859</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L505195/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
