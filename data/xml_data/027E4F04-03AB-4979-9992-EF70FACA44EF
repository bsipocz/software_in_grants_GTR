Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime and travel from their sources at the speed of light, carrying information about physical processes responsible for their emission, obtainable in no other way. They are among the most elusive signals from the deepest reaches in the Universe. Experiments aimed at detecting them have been in development for several decades, and are now reaching sensitivity levels where detection is expected within a few years.
The worldwide network of interferometric detectors includes the German-UK GEO600, the French-Italian Virgo, the American Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and is being enhanced with a new detector under construction - KAGRA in Japan. The former detectors have all reached sensitivities close to their design goals and have taken the most sensitive data to date. Cooperation amongst different projects enables continuous data acquisition, with sensitivity to a wide range of sources and phenomena, over most of the sky. Data from GEO, LIGO and Virgo, have already increased our understanding of astronomical phenomena. Search for gravitational waves at the times of 154 gamma-ray bursts has allowed the best ever exclusion distances and provided evidence for extra-Galactic sources of soft- gamma repeaters. The distance reach for binary black holes in the most recent runs is 300 Mpc and the rate upper limits are now very close to that expected in some of the astrophysical models. The search for gravitational waves from the Vela pulsar has set an upper bound on the strength of radiation that is significantly below that expected from the observed spin down rate of the pulsar, corresponding to a limit on the star's ellipticity of a part in a thousand.
This proposal for equipment will support the experimental programme of detector research and development supported by our Consolidated Grant ST/L000938/1. Detector sensitivity is mainly limited by thermal noise associated with the substrates of the mirrors, their reflective coatings, and their suspension elements, as well as by noise resulting from the quantum nature of the light used in sensing. Our research is targeted towards making innovative improvements in these areas. We have major responsibilities for the silica suspensions in aLIGO, and in the development of enhancements and upgrades to the aLIGO detectors, in the areas of mirror coatings for low thermal noise, silicon substrates, cryogenic suspensions and improved interferometer topologies to combat quantum noise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are numerous beneficiaries from our proposed research in gravitational waves, including industry, other academic disciplines, schools, science centres, museums and the general public. Materials, techniques and computational software created during the design and manufacture of gravitational wave detectors and the analysis of their data, have found numerous uses and applications in industry and other fields of academic research. E.g. the Triana software package that we developed has been used on many industrial and interdisciplinary collaborative projects to date, including: BDWorld (UK); GridLab, CoreGRID and Provenance (EU); GriPhyN and Pegasus (USA). Further, our studies of mirror coating thermal noise have played a key role in the Stanford-Scotland Photonics Innovation Collaboration, designed to capitalise on leading research in the photonics sector.
Our novel oxide bonding technology is the subject of contract research studies with optics companies in the UK and Germany, and a KTP is funded in the UK to transfer the technology in detail to a UK company specialising in the construction of optical components. We are also implementing our planned extensive knowledge exchange activities ranging from optics and engineering to a study of cell behaviour and response to nano-mechanical stimulation, an area of importance for wound healing. The technology for the thin, strong fused silica fibres supporting the 40kg aLIGO mirrors masses has led to partnerships with industry on novel all-silica gravimeters for the oil industry. To achieve our goals we are working closely with local Research &amp;amp; Enterprise and Business Development staff at Glasgow University, and the broader SUPA KT team, in establishing and maintaining collaborations with current and possible future beneficiaries and in the setting up and management of non-disclosure agreements and applications for patents. Thus we will ensure that future knowledge exchange opportunities are identified early and exploited fully.
Outreach to schools, science centres, museums and the general public is very strong in the field of Gravitational Wave research, driven by interest in viewing the Universe through the medium of gravity - probing black holes, the warping of space-time and the big bang itself. We have successfully engaged the wider community through numerous efforts. For example we presented the exhibit &amp;quot;Can you hear Black Holes&amp;quot; at the 2008 Royal Society Summer exhibition with related exhibits still on show in the Science Museum in London, following which we undertook a key role in the design and construction of the NSF-funded US exhibit &amp;quot;Astronomy's New Messengers&amp;quot; which featured at the World Science Festivals in 2009 and 2010 and then as a touring exhibit. With funding from STFC we developed &amp;quot;Gravity Beyond the Apple&amp;quot;, an interactive secondary school science show delivered in conjunction with the award-winning &amp;quot;Science Made Simple&amp;quot; public outreach company based in Cardiff University. We also made a key contribution to the &amp;quot;100 Hours of Astronomy&amp;quot; IYA2009 cornerstone project, which featured live webcasts from all the ground-based gravitational wave observatories, and more recently have been very active in Star-Gazing Live.
In the future we will maintain and extend our programme of public engagement, through our existing network of relationships with key outreach stakeholders, which includes: science centres and museums, national education authorities, the amateur astronomical community, the media and professional science communicators - particularly Wendy Sadler, director of &amp;quot;Science Made Simple&amp;quot; and the science team at the Glasgow Science Centre. Among our specific plans we will deliver across the UK numerous interactive lectures to schools, astronomical societies and the general public, in the areas of gravitational wave detection, cosmology and multi-messenger astronomy, drawing upon the suite of themed lectures which we have already developed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51716</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talk with Prof. Andrew Hart (Plastic Surgeon), Clinicians in Research Network</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95327867-E4FA-429D-8303-48C529B012BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c984c3533848.68414750</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to the Stirling Astronomical Society, Paisley.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D291C241-9513-485A-8D98-86E8C9075AD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>as above</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9855942aef4.23421555</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to the Renfrewshire Astronomical Society, Paisley</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF496900-A048-4527-989A-99512F184827</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk to the Renfrewshire Astronomical Society, Paisley</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c98598091772.14995211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BlueDit Music Festival - talk on gravitational waves</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BE8F660-F5F7-47EE-84C9-1506A50275C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BlueDot</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c983e9ab0f07.52546610</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.discoverthebluedot.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote public lecture for the British Orthopaedic Research Society (BORS).</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F46A0BD3-2962-416A-8AB8-FCD49EE9BCA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BORS</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9844d81d815.90605849</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://borsoc.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This funding has provided facilities that are currently shared between Gas Sensing Solutions Ltd and UWS, developing novel optoelectronic technologies that can be integrated with silicon devices.
