By exploiting the temporal separation of fluorescent molecules, proteins can be localised to nano-scale spatial precision allowing researchers to explore the structure and dynamics of cellular processes at unprecedented levels of detail. However, analysis of such data is still restricted to be largely qualitative and based around visual inspection of reconstructed images. Given the fantastic recent progress of Bayesian and machine-learning statistical methodology, there is the opportunity to develop a fully quantitative alternative approach. In fact, we propose that we can learn a full generative model for molecular-level cellular architecture. This approach will allow us to answer previously impossible phenotypical biological questions relating to the organisation and co-organisation of sub-cellular structures, for example: 

1. &amp;quot;Is the clustering of a membrane protein caused by the underlying actin cytoskeleton?&amp;quot; (the hypothesis testing problem)
2. &amp;quot;Does a drug change the relationship between a membrane protein and the cytoskeleton&amp;quot; (the classification problem)
3. &amp;quot;Is the emergence of a cancerous cell in a normal population detectable from changes in its nanoscale architecture&amp;quot; (the anomaly detection problem)

We postulate that complex architectural arrangements can be described by the composition and coordination of simpler morphological elements. At their most basic, these might be simple clusters or aggregates of molecules. More complicated elements could include a complex, branched fibrous structure. We have been at the forefront of developing cluster analysis methodology for SMLM. We will approach the (much) larger problem of describing cellular architecture by first building a full cluster and fibre analysis toolkit for 2 and 3D SMLM data. Next, we will acquire high-volume multi-colour SMLM data and develop Bayesian machine-learning methodology to learn the probabilistic composition and coordination of simpler morphological elements (e.g. as identified through our toolkit) to give a full generative model for cellular architecture. Once achieved, we will further develop a statistical and machine-learning layer of inference methodology to address phenotypical questions such as those given above. 

The main biological application we will examine during this project is the architecture of the T cell immunological synapse which is key for regulating T cell activation and hence the immune response. This opens the exciting opportunity to collaborate with clinicians and drug developers to test how therapeutic agents affect molecular-level cellular architecture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In this project, we will acquire high-volume, multi-colour SMLM data from the T cell immunological synapse. Using this data as a test bed, we will develop Bayesian and machine-learning methodology to allow automatic statistical analysis of the data. In particular, we will develop generative models for cellular architecture, as well as the methodology to exploit these generative models to achieve molecular-level cell phenotyping. This will allow us to answer questions such as: 

1. &amp;quot;Is the clustering of a membrane protein caused by the underlying actin cytoskeleton?&amp;quot; (the hypothesis testing problem)
2. &amp;quot;Does a drug change the relationship between a membrane protein and the cytoskeleton&amp;quot; (the classification problem)
3. &amp;quot;Is the emergence of a cancerous cell in a normal population detectable from changes in its nanoscale architecture&amp;quot; (the anomaly detection problem)

The statistical methodology to realise this ambition will be developed in three stages. 

1. Develop a statistical toolkit for the identification of simple morphological elements in SMLM including fibres and clusters in 2D and 3D.
2. Develop a generative model for the full cellular architecture that combines the individual morphological elements.
3. From such generative models, develop molecular-level cell phenotyping methodology based on elemental composition and arrangement.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The methodology proposed constitutes the first attempt to create a full, molecular-level statistical model for a cell. Applications are virtually limitless, but the main industrial avenues through which exploitation will be sought are pharmaceutical and through incorporation into commercial image analysis software. The PIs are currently in conversation with industry, on the use of identification, modelling and phenotyping methodology for drug characterization. In this collaboration, our team would interact with industrial researcher counterparts, exchanging imaging data and code, to obtain richer and more quantitative descriptions of the phenotypical effects of new drugs. Such collaborations will result in patents, a wide industrial uptake of our methods, and may open the door to much larger endeavours, that would be impossible without industrial partners, such as developing a full multi-dimensional phenotypical spectrum of the effects of all drugs currently on the market. The societal benefits are ultimately human health. Firstly, we can improve drug development and testing by allowing molecular level phenotyping of potential drug candidates (in collaboration with industry as described above). Secondly, we will gain a greater understanding of the role of architecture in regulating T cells which are crucial for mounting an immune response and finally, we will be able to describe the physical alterations which take place in diseased cells, for example cancerous cells or those associated with autoimmune disease.

Before long-term societal impact takes shape, the immediate beneficiaries will be researchers currently using SMLM to study biological samples. Already, our toolkit for cluster analysis is used routinely in labs around the world, for example, the Molecular Gynaecology lab, Goethe University, Frankfurt, the Molecular and Cell Biology lab, University of California, Berkeley, the Single Molecule Science Laboratory at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, the Department of Biological Sciences at the Toronto University, Canada, the UK's National Microscope Facility at the STFC in Harwell and many more. It is just as important to be able to identify fibres as well as elliptical clusters in 2 and 3D in biological data, which is the Aim 1 of this proposal. The methodology would allow those scientists to conduct hard hypothesis tests about SMLM data collected on their biological system of interest concerning, for example, the density of the cortical actin meshwork, the increase in molecular clustering after cell stimulation or the presence of vesicles in proximity to the plasma membrane.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>277936</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R007837/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
