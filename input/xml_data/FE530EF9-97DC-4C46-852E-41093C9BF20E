We aim to understand the way in which sounds are represented in neuron?s firing in the brain: the ?computations on sound? performed by the brain and how the way we percieve sounds depends upon it. We do this with a combination of methods: measuring behaviour in response to sound, measuring directly the activity in neurons that process sound, and simulating on computers both how we percience sound and how neurons in the brain process it. For example, we are currently working how how neurons in the auditory system affect our ability to detect quiet signals in the presence of other sounds.

These experiments complement other research designed to gain knowledge about normal and abnormal auditory processing in people and the development of therapeutic strategies for brain- and ear-based hearing disorders. Research on hearing in animals has led directly to the development of digital hearing aids and cochlear implants. However, in terms of quality of life the biggest impact of hearing impairment is on the ability to perceive sounds in noisy environments. Modern hearing aids and cochlear implants still do not help much with this, probably because we do not understand how people with normal hearing function in these situations. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of auditory perception will improve the treatment of auditory related health problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of this research group is to understand the way in which sound is processed by neural circuitry in the brain, and how it underpins auditory perception. We do this through the integration of physiological, behavioural and computational techniques. This work is essential if we are to properly understand how we hear; for example, how we are able to perceive distinct sound sources in complex listening environments, and how neural processing is affected by hearing impairments. 
Basic research into hearing has traditionally been dominated by two distinct branches: psychoacoustics measures subjects' ability to detect and discriminate sounds by, for example, pressing buttons; auditory neuroscience studies the response of neurons to sound.These separate approaches have led to considerable advances in treating hearing disorders. However, it was always difficult to relate these two types of measurement.Part of our goal is to better relate perception to neural coding, by studying them together in integrated experiments. For example, by recording directly from neurons in the auditory brain during active listening. We are currently attempting to understand the relationships between the frequency resolution of hearing measured perceptually, in the cochlea, and at different nuclei in the central auditory system. Other recent work includes investigating cortical correlates of the way we perceptually group sequences sound sounds, or the way a loud sound renders a quiet sound following it undetectable. These techniques can also be used to study the effects of deficits in hearing, and even changes following implantation of hearing prostheses. How do we adapt to a loss of hearing, or to the change in auditory inputs when we receive a cochlea implant? 
The other goal of this research is to understand the underlying computations that lead to the neural representations of sound. We do this through theoretical and computational models of auditory processing. We simulate, in computer programmes, neurons' responses to sound in order to generate and test theories about underlying mechanisms, and also use them to predict as yet untested properties of neurons. For example, it has long been known that the timing of spikes is important in auditory coding ? neurons tend to fire precisely in time to specific features in a sound. However, we have recently shown that neurons in the auditory brainstem encode the stimulus with much more complex temporal patterns of spikes ? and furthermore were able to relate these back to the mathematics of non-linear oscillators, and show how simple computer models of neurons replicate these complex behaviours</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>690000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_00010/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
