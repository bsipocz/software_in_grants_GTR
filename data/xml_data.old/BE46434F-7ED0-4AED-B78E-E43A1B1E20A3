Existing evidence suggests that early-emerging antisocial behaviour problems are most likely to develop when genetically-vulnerable children experience harsh, non-supportive parenting. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The goal of the research is to test this hypothesis and to identify physiological and psychological factors that explain this association. The sample will include 300 8- to 10-year-old children who were first evaluated as part of a separate study when they were three years old. Half of these children experienced very high levels of harsh, non-supportive parenting when they were three and half experienced low levels of harsh, non-supportive parenting. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research assistants will conduct home visits to interview parents and children about the children's behaviour, experiences of stressful life events, and family demographics. Children will provide samples of the stress hormone cortisol and children and parents will provide DNA samples. This study is expected to provide new information about why genes and environments combine to influence antisocial behaviour, to identify the most vulnerable children, and to identify modifiable risk factors for childhood antisocial behaviour that could become the targets of psychosocial or pharmacological interventions.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>734290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lecture (Cardiff University)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BFC2FCE3-E5CF-42D5-94C0-4384C3F54F8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards

Based on my research, I was invited to participate in several meetings organized by the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families in the United States to discuss research on the neurobiology of abuse and neglect. I was also invited to write the lead article in a Society for Research in Child Development Social Policy Report on the neurobiology of abuse and neglect. This report reviewed the relevant literature and discussed the policy implications of this research for the various sectors that interact with maltreated youth (e.g., health care, child protective services, foster care services).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD08EC3E-3563-4C71-A3B2-11A750E98A94</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5494424a809c05.37105974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our goal was to test whether harsh and nonsupportive parenting in early childhood was associated with children's physiological and behavioral development when they were 8 to 11 years old. We also aimed to better understand why some children might be resilient to early experiences of harsh and non-supportive parenting. So far, we have shown that children who experienced harsh and non-supportive parenting at age 3 had a blunted stress response 5 to 7 years later (as measured by the stress hormone cortisol), but only if they had also experienced traumatic events in the recent past, like violence in their families or neighborhoods. Thus, early and on-going exposure to harsh parenting and traumatic events was associated with a blunted cortisol response that was also predictive of children's externalizing and internalizing problems. In the absence of on-going exposure to traumatic events however, harsh and non-supportive parenting in early childhood were not associated with cortisol reactivity. This research was published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in 2014. In a different paper, we found that children who were experiencing harsh parenting, low parental warmth, and other traumatic events in the family and neighborhood were at especially elevated risk for internalizing and externalizing problems if they carried the short form of a gene called the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region, but not if they carried two copies of the long form of this gene. Moreover, we showed that youth who carried the short form of the gene were at elevated risk for internalizing problems under conditions of environmental risk because they less frequently used distraction coping strategies (e.g., doing physical activity, reading a book to take their mind off their problems). We are making minor revisions to this manuscript for invited resubmission to the journal Development and Psychopathology. Finally, we have found that boys (but not girls) who experienced harsh and non-supportive parenting at age 3 scored higher on a measure of hostile attributional bias (i.e., the tendency to attribute malign intent to others under conditions of ambiguity). This effect was only significant, however, for boys who carried two copies of the minor allele of the beta 2 adrenergic receptor gene, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular reactivity. Thus, boys who have a genotype that predisposes to cardiovascular reactivity and who have been exposed to high levels of hostility in the family are quicker to attribute malign intend to another person's (potentially benign) behavior than boys who carry a different genotype or who have not been exposed to a hostile family environment. We are currently revising this manuscript for resubmission. These findings have been summarized in a Society for Research in Child Development Social Policy Report published in 2014 which reviewed studies on the neurobiology of abuse and neglect and discussed the implications of this research for policy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings potentially inform interventions for youth at risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. For example, our findings suggest that interventions to promote the use of distraction coping strategies may be particularly effective for youth who are already experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Our findings also suggest that relaxation interventions (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness meditation) may reduce blood pressure and help at least a subset of youth who come from hostile family environments to better encode, interpret, and respond to others' behavior, particularly under conditions of ambiguity. Finally, our findings on cortisol reactivity suggest that studies designed to identify links between exposure to stressors and cortisol reactivity must take into account a child's developmental history of stressor exposure (i.e., timing and chronicity) in order to make accurate predictions about whether stressor exposure at a given point in time will be associated with hyper- or hypo-activity of the stress response system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>77EB5B5A-5DE3-4888-B5B7-27D76C033947</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>549440d13629f7.83564381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F145026-3127-4809-B488-B3E7CCF1F69F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do genetic or environmental factors underlie low resting hart rate?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7b340b1586e62d11a60f32976b16565d"><gtr:id>7b340b1586e62d11a60f32976b16565d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Laura  Lysenko (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2300198023cad96c7a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DF35CE6B-A497-4233-B6BA-9E4658645A81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interactive effects of early and recent exposure to stressful contexts on cortisol reactivity in middle childhood.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5fb5d033e3e42436b0ebf89df3406665"><gtr:id>5fb5d033e3e42436b0ebf89df3406665</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jaffee SR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9630</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5437fac1a18283.45212418</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A14F9D4-04FE-4EAD-8F17-6197A92F7082</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Interactive Effects of Harsh, Non-Responsive Parenting and ADRB2 Genotype on Hostile Attribution Bias</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c713d6b0f5760644bb74cb09fcec867"><gtr:id>3c713d6b0f5760644bb74cb09fcec867</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cline J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5437fc31418d98.84628279</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B7792DF5-5985-4EBE-B2E0-5D7FD26FB6AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The biological embedding of child abuse and neglect: Implications for policy and practice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2f34a27d84abadcad6e0cfaeee82c2a8"><gtr:id>2f34a27d84abadcad6e0cfaeee82c2a8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jaffee S.
