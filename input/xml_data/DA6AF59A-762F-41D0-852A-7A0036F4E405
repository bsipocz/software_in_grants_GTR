Devolution of powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly has brought gradual progress towards the normalisation of policing and justice. Yet the legacy of conflict persists, its manifestation in sectarianism, paramilitarism and occasional out-breaks of street protests and rioting. Despite the significance of the ?peace process? many children and young people experience a society that remains divided, navigating tensions within and between communities that limit their lives, experiences and potential.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The UNCRC and children?s advocates have raised the deleterious impact of negative media representations particularly regarding formal and informal regulation. Engaging with children, young people, NGOs and media representatives, this project will focus on the consequences of such representations:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>public reaction&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>policy responses&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>rights violations.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>It will hold participatory workshops with diverse groups of children and young people, produce resources based on both workshops and media content analysis, establish a charter of ethical practice, lobby government departments and establish a framework for knowledge-sharing between children?s sector NGOs and media organisations. It will also publish guidance:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>supporting the professional practice and advocacy work of community, voluntary, and statutory agencies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>promoting responsible media coverage&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>informing children and young people of their rights.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major beneficiaries of the project will be children and young people, and NGOs in the child and youth sector in Northern Ireland. Children and young people will benefit directly through involvement in participatory workshops that aim to raise awareness, enhance personal and social development and increase their understanding of their rights. An additional group of children (involved in an Advisory Group) will benefit further through capacity building that will develop their communication and design skills, and increase their capacity to advocate on their own behalf. Indirectly, the aim is that in raising awareness of negative representations, and through lobbying for change, that the project will have a wider impact on how children and young people are viewed publicly and how they are represented in the media. Given the detrimental impact of negative perceptions on young people, the project has the potential to impact positively on the well-being of young people.

Those NGOs involved in the Advisory Group will benefit directly as this Group provides a forum for knowledge exchange and networking among stakeholders, providing the potential for partnership working and lobbying. At a wider level, the child and youth community and voluntary sector will benefit from the resources produced as a result of the project. A Background Paper will provide evidence that will inform their lobbying, and a dedicated resource will support practitioners in advising young people with regards to media engagement (thus informing practice). 

The lead NGO partner organisation (Include Youth) will be a direct beneficiary of the project with regards to knowledge and skills development that will benefit the organisation beyond the project's duration. This includes the development of research skills (e.g. content analysis; the systematic collection and analysis of information), and in setting systems in place to monitor, record and measure impact.

The project will also provide information and evidence that will be of benefit to the Northern Ireland Commission for Children and Young People as they advocate for policy implementation and reform within the media. Further, since the UNCRC's Concluding Observations stating the need for states parties to challenge negative representations of young people, including in the media, the NI Assembly's Office of the First and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) has identified 'countering negative portrayal and perceptions of young people' as a priority. This project aims to develop and inform that priority.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90138</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>To date, two publications: 'Behind the Headlines: The voices and experiences of children and young people' and 'In the Headlines: Advice for children, young people and those that work with them about talking to the media' have been published and distributed to schools, youth centres, statutory and non-statutory agencies and to media organisations. A 15-point Charter, including ethical guidelines, for agreeing broadcast and publishing protocols has been agreed by media representatives and will be published. The initial findings have been presented to Government (NI Assembly) departments including the Children's Ministers and local authorities and these will be expanded with the publication of the final research report in Autumn 2015. All participating NGOs have adopted the research findings and have written to confirm their intentions for taking forward the research outcomes. Further and higher education journalism training courses and the unions have adopted the publications and findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6FD56102-6AD1-4B0F-828C-8C2CCCAB92BE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460d97a3930b7.67159237</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research team's primary research involved structured, small-group workshops with 141 children and young people across Northern Ireland including what are often considered 'hard-to-reach' groups, a tailored research workshop run in partnership with youth work agencies, in-depth interviews with those working with children and young people, focus groups (2) with journalists and broadcasters, interviews with the NI Children's Commissioner and staff and with civil servants. 
Achievements:
1. Generating sustainable participatory public engagement with a diverse population of children and young people and their workers from multiple agencies. Establishing a participatory context developed by the research team and the lead partner Include Youth to advance a shared understanding of the generic and specific issues arising from media portrayals of and interventions in the lives of children and young people. Examples of diversity in participation are: community groups across the sectarian divide; LGBT; disability groups; Roma and Travellers; children in care; homeless young people. In a society transitioning slowly from these achievements on this sensitive topic are unprecedented.
2. The culmination of knowledge exchange was a full day conference, Behind the Headlines. Alongside the research team, young people from diverse organisations presented their experiences of the media (as 'subjects' and participants). Attended by policy makers, political representatives, the NI Children's Commissioner and statutory and non-statutory organisations it focused on outcomes of the project's participatory research. It launched the research team's Interim Report and the partner organisation's young people's report reflecting the close affiliation between the research team, Include Youth and the non-statutory agencies named in the application. 
3. Feedback from subsequent workshops and invited presentations informing professional agencies' practice has been significant including: understanding and impact of negative media portrayals; methods of interrogating media coverage as part of their engagement with children and young people; new programmes of work about sensitive personal and political issues; dialogue with children and young people to challenge and change the negative representations of children and young people; positive media representation of previously 'invisible' groups. 
4. Cognisant of press and broadcast guidelines governing coverage of children and young people, the researchers worked closely with children, young people and workers within participating agencies to develop and negotiate a charter of good practice. Alongside the initial research findings document and the children's/ young people's version published by Include Youth, it has been used to lobby Members of the Legislative Assembly and local politicians. Reflecting professional defensiveness, some media organisations and journalists have appeared reluctant to adopt the principles established within the Charter.
However, the research has informed the foundation journalism training programme at Belfast Metropolitan College and the Northern Ireland children's sector submission to the 2015-16 examination of the UK and NI Governments' compliance with the principles of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. Further, the initial findings received significant media coverage leading to subsequent, invited presentations by the research team.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project's background paper and initial consultations informed the work of participating non-statutory organisations. As anticipated, this was a collaborative process. Throughout the project the team worked alongside Include Youth's Communications and Research Officers monitoring media coverage, developing the primary research programme with other agencies, developing the academic foundation for strategic media consultations and political lobbying. This will be incorporated into the project's final report, distributed to statutory and non-statutory agencies and to all schools (primary/ secondary) and youth clubs/ centres. Adoption by these agencies and, in principle by the Northern Ireland Assembly and its civil servants, of the interim findings augurs well for constructive dialogue beyond publication of the final report. Following the outcome of the 2016 NI Assembly elections and the appointment of both children's junior ministers further dialogue will address the final report's recommendations and consultations will be held with the children's and young people's unit. Northern Ireland local authorities are adjusting to reorganisation and the research findings will be publicised to all departments with direct and indirect responsibility for children and young people. Central to this generic objective is awareness-raising regarding the affirmation and protection of children's rights in accordance with international duties and obligations. Publication of the final report coincides with the UN Committee's assessment of the both governments' compliance with UNCRC articles and principles. Criticism by the UNCRC in its previous Concluding Observations (2008) regarding the deleterious impact on children of negative media reporting initiated this project. Raising awareness through knowledge exchange opportunities afforded by the research has consolidated a collective commitment that will resonate beyond its initial remit. Meetings and workshops have been held with journalists, editors and producers resulted in an agreed 15-point Charter recognising and protecting the interests of children and young people in their dealings with the media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>162C25DF-1047-4DF1-BC62-58E5F8108070</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460d8820f4e54.98165336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K000837/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B5BE8F24-714F-40A1-A916-173CBD85A2E5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Rights</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
