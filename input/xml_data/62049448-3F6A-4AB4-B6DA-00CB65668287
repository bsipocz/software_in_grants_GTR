The College of Life and Environmental Sciences received funds of &amp;pound;4.2 million between 2005 and 2008 from the NERC making it the second largest funder of research for the College.
During this time there was no dedicated support for KE in the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences (GEES) which receives the largest amount of NERC funds of all the University Schools. It is anticipated that the availability of a dedicated fellow to assist with Business outreach activities specifically in the area of Natural Environment will provide a necessary boost to business transfer activity in this area. 
Realistically in the current economic climate an increase in KE income of around 10-20% would be expected from the increased business contact generated by the fellow. However input into large collaborative projects generating ongoing investment would aim to greatly increase the College KE income and help to further excellence in research. Support for this comes from the successful Medici Scheme that has been running for Biomedical related schools in the University of Birmingham for the last 7 years but more recently has become a training scheme only. Medici Fellows at UoB between 2004-2008 were been responsible for bringing in &amp;gt;&amp;pound;400K (based on % effort), as well as 64 disclosures of technology to the TTO and filing 12 patents. This has helped to bring about a culture change in the Schools in which they have worked.
Involvement of a KE fellow is particularly key where companies that approach the University with interest in academic collaboration are discouraged for various reasons including: timeliness of response, ability to access the correct academic and lack of a single point of contact that means they may have to explain their needs to multiple contacts. The loss of business mentioned in the previous section stems from talks with Millipore in 2007 who were keen to establish a long term relationship with Academics in the College consting of (a) support for university researchers and (b) payment for transfer of know how into Millipore labs for development. It is estimated that losing business in this way may have cost the University and College tens of thousands of pounds.

Measurement of impact to University
Measurement of KE Fellow impact will be carried out quarterly. Measurements will include:
? Number of Contacts with academics to discuss possible exploitation cases and contribution to disclosures to the Technology Transfer Office
? Development of Business offerings ? number of offerings made 
? Income in &amp;pound; (Investment, Consultancy, Industrial research) ? based on % effort contribution. 
? Development of business relationships ? contribution to college industrial linkage (no. of new academic/industry links formed) 
? Conferences/Workshops - person days attended 
? Case Studies/Articles published

Local Economic Impact
GEES has a history of working with the local community. In particular there are close ties with Birmingham City Council and local water companies. Traditionally Birmingham has been less successful than other Universities in the region at securing Knowledge Transfer Partnerships but the majority in the college exist within GEES in NERC research areas. There is therefore potential to maximise on available funds for KTPs in the college by ensuring their benefits are demonstrated. Initially this would involve inviting local companies to visit and meet academics and create a more accessible and business facing College. In the longer term the increase in collaborative projects in the region would impact on the technical ability while the KTPs often lead to the creation of Jobs. Figures show that on average, the business benefits from a single KTP project are:
? an increase of over &amp;pound;227,000 in annual profits before tax
? creation of three genuine new jobs
? an increase in the skills of existing staff (~15 existing staff trained).
Additionallrt equipment via purchasing spare capacity could provide significant added value to SMEs that would otherwise have no access to this high value equipment. 

Wider Economic Impact
The Global Environment Industry is worth &amp;pound;364 billion however the UK?s share of this market is ~half that of other European countries (e.g. France and Germany) accounting for only 4.7%. 
A few very large UK companies are successful in this field in particular the UK water plc?s. However areas such as renewable energy and waste recycling are lagging behind the rest of Europe
To counter this, the UK needs to increase the expertise in these fields and develop innovative technologies to create competitive advantage by utilising the excellent research and knowledge base, which is available to them from Universities such as Birmingham. This will not only increase the market share for UK companies but in the longer term ensure larger multinational company investment in the UK.

Measurement of Economic Impact
Measurement of impact to the local economy and wider will be carried out yearly. Measuring this aspect is more of a challenge however and is likely to involve a longer term impact that may be difficult to measure. Obvious impacts may be in the form of jobs created and business brought into the region/country that might otherwise have gone elsewhere. This will be reviewed on a project by project basis and with consultation with industrial partners where possible. Outputs will be assessed in the following areas:
? Jobs created
? Businesses created (e.g. Spin out company formation)
? Business support, assistance to improve a business 
? Business support, collaborations with a knowledge base
? Money levered in through private and public funders
? People assisted with high skills development
? Number of workshops and seminars provided to industry
? Number of new patents/licence agreements
? Presentations at national and international industry attended conferuates retained in the region 
Because of the complexities in establishing these metrics the measurement process will be reviewed and refined throughout the course of the Fellowship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J500598/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
