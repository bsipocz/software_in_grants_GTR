This is an important emerging field in clinical research, and one that has attracted considerable investment in the UK and internationally. The main areas of development include gene therapy medicinal products, cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Its importance lies in its promise to transform healthcare by offering curative, not palliative, therapeutics through the regeneration of tissue within the body. This in itself may reshape healthcare provision though it is equally important to understand how the existing healthcare system will influence the pathways through which the field develops. In addition, the field poses new challenges for regulators because of the ways in which the 'mode of action' of tissue/cell therapies is quite different from the most common innovation the regulator has to understand and approve (or not), the new pharmaceutical drug. In short, the project seeks to understand the complex relationship between these clinical and wider social, organisational, regulatory and economic issues. 

It does so through a series of Workpackages (WP). The first maps the field in the UK (within its wider international - principally EU/US context), especially in regard to current patterns of investment, clinical trials, product development, the intellectual property strategies of companies and the specific regulatory processes shaping these. The second WP examines the role of a range of intermediary agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), patient groups and health insurance companies, in determining what can be called 'healthcare readiness' for the field, that is, how the field aligns with and can be embedded in existing practice and how far changes need to be made. The third WP involves detailed case studies of firms and hospital sites currently engaged in developing/using cell therapies chosen to reflect a) different regulatory classifications by product area b) the main areas of current activity by disease that are closely linked, and the sites that we would access to track product development. We will use a methodology called Analysis of Life Science Innovation Systems (ALSIS) modelling which captures different types of business models, value-chains and their relationship to the wider innovation environment. This allows us to examine the full range of activities required to bring a product from conception to market or to direct application in a hospital within the wider economic, regulatory, societal and political contexts that play a key role in determining the scale and scope of the innovation. 

In the fourth WP the ALSIS method which allows us to map and explain innovation paths will be integrated with and triangulated against our modelling of the potential future of the field using horizon scanning techniques developed by one of the co-applicants based at the National Institute of Health Research Horizon Scanning Centre to interrogate likely diffusion paths within health care, and the expectations surrounding regenerative medicine among public and private actors (including government and private agencies). 

Throughout the project we will work with collaborating parties, including the participating companies, hospitals, regulatory and reimbursement agencies (notably the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and NICE), patient groups, Research Councils UK, the Technology Strategy Board's Cell Therapy Catapult, the NIHR's i4i Secretariat, the Science and Technology Select Committee and the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Social Science and Policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will make an important contribution towards understanding the likely pathways that regenerative medicine takes within the UK and other health care systems, by identifying distinct commercial and non-commercial (e.g. hospital) routes to its application, including in particular cell therapies but in other domains too. It will also benefit regulatory and HTA agencies for their own formal regulatory models as well as more informal deliberations with those in the field seeking advice about regulation, product development and uptake within the NHS. Bio-clinical researchers participating in the regional stem cell and tissue engineering networks and patient groups keen to understand the likely availability of therapies will have a much clearer understanding of the trends ahead through the horizon-scanning element of the project. The research will clarify likely scenarios of adoption and diffusion for NHS policymakers and commissioners in different clinical sectors. Our case studies' descriptions and analysis will provide examples of RM development models and their challenges that will be of direct value to the Technology Strategy Board's Catapult Centre, to companies and public researchers developing their own innovation strategies. Patient groups likely to be most interested in the outcome of the research are those associated with the principal areas of inquiry where trialling and product development is underway, such as in musculoskeletal, stroke, and cardiovascular areas of research. 

These outcomes of the research address the needs identified in the UK government's very recent review of its current investment in the life-sciences, most importantly to understand investment trends and the reimbursement landscape and to use social science to identify the value and likely market penetration of regenerative medical products. Moreover, our work on comparing hospital-based innovation via the 'exemption' or 'specials' route with the product-driven trials process addresses the government's desire to show how the NHS and commercial activities might be more effectively integrated. NICE is charged with the assessment of new products, requiring information about comparators, cost-consequence analysis, impact on patient pathways, and workflows in the NHS. The results of our work feed directly into these concerns and we will be able to help NICE, the new NHS Commissioning Board and the recently established Emerging Science and Bioethics Advisory Committee (ESBAC - Tait is leading ESBACs Regulatory Issues Working Group) develop new policy for the field, including informing the possible establishment of a national commissioning agency for RM.

The research also addresses a major issue identified by the Ministerial Industry Strategy Group (MISG) in a report that the applicants helped to prepare on the regulation and development of regenerative medicine, which has been passed to the House of Lords Inquiry due to report in 2013. There it is argued that social science research is needed to understand the 'institutional readiness' of the healthcare system, to complement the 'technological readiness' which the major science funding agencies are working to secure.

Finally, the research will contribute to debates at a European level about core problems of the RM market that have been raised in the European Medicines Agency and the European Parliament and which need to be addressed over the next few years as products come to regulators for market approval: these include the form that clinical trials and postmarket surveillance will take, clarification of the use of the hospital exemption, orphan medicine and other routes to therapy to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between commercial incentivisation and non-commercial development, and the pattern of reimbursement regimes and whether new models are needed to foster the development of the field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1237896</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Membership of the Committee on Advanced Therapies, European Medicines Agency</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>62F2F90D-BABC-4633-8539-DEAA10F60086</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The engagement is yet to be fully realised and this entry on ResearchFish will be updated over the coming months

? RM will require a range of novel or redistributed manufacturing micro-factories close to clinics to be viable
? as a result, scenarios need to be developed for the likely size and profiles of clinical populations treatable through different manufacturing modalities and scales to support national planning in the NHS

Further details on the findings and additional results when the project is fully complete later in 2017 will be uploaded to Research Fish</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In terms of being directly involved in steering decision-making in regard to the assessment and strategic path best suited to the field of regenerative medicine, Webster was appointed (as the only social scientist) to serve on the DoH/MRC Regenerative Medicine Expert Group's sub-committee on the governance and regulation of RM and its subsequent Advisory Group in regard to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) assessment and recommendations relating to the technology appraisal methodology for RM. 

The project has helped to shape the NHSE's approach to innovation 'spread'. This is especially so for members of the NHSE's Specialised Commissioning Service in helping them to understand the pathways to adoption of new biomedical technologies and envisaged routes for RM that go beyond the currently limited framework of 'specialised' treatment to how more extensive therapy might be possible. More widely, Webster was asked to establish a new 'specialist interest group' in the RM field for the NHS's CHAIN (Contact, Help, Advice and Information Network) network (established some 20 years ago), which has over 15000 members working in the NHS across the UK. This has allowed members to secure specific advice and information from the research to help shape their local needs. For example, CHAIN members from the Community Health Exchange in Scotland have been advised on the possible RM developments relating to long-term conditions and the likely clinical routes to therapy ahead. 

The project has also informed government thinking through its contribution to the House of Commons Select Committee (data drawn on) and collaborated with the MHRA and its Patient Forum (note: see documents that will be available mid Jan 2016 for both of these) to run the first MHRA/social science event (described by the host - Mike Dykes - as 'pioneering') that examined the implications of RM for patient groups and regulatory affairs. The key issues raised and which will form the basis for the Patient Forum's activity in the area were: understanding pathways to the clinic; the impact of geography and regional differences in regard to the availability and access of RM therapies; and the need to consider carefully the range and level of risk that patients are prepared to take (especially in treatments of the last resort). 

Webster also organised an All Party Parliamentary Group on Health (House of Commons, November 8, 2016) meeting to discuss RM which led to a Report for Group members and a series of questions for its MPs to follow-up. Moreover, the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee invited questions from the project that were then put during an oral evidence session on December 7th with senior staff from the NHS, and other parties. The Chair of the Select Committee - Stephen Metcalfe - invited Webster to a personal meeting to discuss the issues raised.

A number of UK Patient Groups have worked with the project in late 2016 order to help shape their forward plans and possibilities in relation to the role of RM for their patient groups: these include ScarFree and Parkinson's UK. The latter, for example, have developed a joint-proposal with SATSU to explore the role of patient-centred/led innovation; the implications this has for pathways to the clinic; and the production, marshalling and integration of diverse forms of patient data.

Finally, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry's (ABPI) invited Webster (in 2017) to contribute towards its work with industry on manufacturing innovation, especially around MMIP (the Medicines Manufacturing Industry Partnership) and the specific place of RM within this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>521DC5A8-7931-4245-B2F6-4D3620DD361D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0532366d4e7.97443480</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/satsu/current-projects/regenablemed/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Policy Briefings</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2732F76-BF44-4A50-95F0-A8A0423F604A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through engagement with UK and international policy agencies the REGenableMED project has been directly involved in steering decision-making in regard to the assessment and strategic path best suited to the field of regenerative medicine (RM).
