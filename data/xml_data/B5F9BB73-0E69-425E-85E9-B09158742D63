Interferometers</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/L004801/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Over the last 25 years, large improvements in the detection capabilities of current telescopes in the infrared (IR) and radio parts of the spectrum of light, have allowed us to carry out systematic studies of the population of stars present in clusters deeply embedded in molecular dark clouds across our Galaxy. These clusters, which remain hidden behind large amounts of interstellar molecular gas and dust, cannot be accessed by telescopes operating at optical wavelengths because the radiation emitted by young stars is absorbed by interstellar cold dust, which re-emits it afterwards at infrared and radio wavelengths. These IR and radio studies have revealed that most stars in our Galaxy form in clusters, and that these clusters typically show a wide distribution of masses that range from brown dwarfs, with 13-80 times the mass of Jupiter, to the most massive stars, with over a hundred times the mass of the Sun (or Mo). This mass distribution is called the Initial Mass Function (IMF) and peaks broadly between 0.1-0.5 Mo indicating that most stars forming in our Galaxy are low-mass stars. Massive stars - stars with masses larger than 8 Mo - are therefore rare. However, they dominate the energetics and feedback of galaxies, since they inject vast amounts of energy in the form of winds, strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation and supernovae explosions. Despite their short life times, massive stars dramatically modify the dynamical, thermal and chemical properties of the interstellar medium (ISM), shaping the structure of galaxies and largely impacting on galaxy evolution. Massive stars are also a key source of heavy elements, enriching the ISM for future generations of stars and for their associated solar systems. Understanding the physical processes that lead to the formation of massive stars is therefore crucial to establish their role in galaxy formation and evolution, and in the origin of life. However, in contrast with low-mass stars whose formation mechanisms are relatively well-known, the processes that lead to massive star birth still remain unclear. Observational studies of massive star forming regions are indeed challenging in modern astronomy because these regions are located at distances very far from us (further away than 1 kpc or 3000 light years), they show a complex morphology and structure with a high level of confusion, and they remain hidden behind large amounts of molecular gas and dust. The unprecedented capabilities of the new generation synthesis imaging radio telescopes such as the Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea (Hawaii), the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) located in the french Alps, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) located in the Atacama desert in Chile, will represent a breakthrough in radio astronomy since they will allow us to image massive star forming regions with much higher detail (angular resolution), sensitivity (to discover new and fainter features), and at wavelength ranges never explored before. Molecules, which are very abundant in these regions, will be used as probes because they are very sensitive to the different physical processes (UV photon illumination or shock waves) taking place in the ISM. In this proposal, I will therefore combine the detailed information provided by the observations with these telescopes, with theoretical models of the chemistry of the ISM to understand the physical processes involved in the formation of the most massive stars in our Galaxy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>451296</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Max Planck Institute For Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Infrared-Dark Cloud collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>7ACB74B4-B7CA-4D45-B09E-2E6E4A1DBECE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>5 published papers + 1 submitted paper + 2 papers in preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c166620f01a4.55321830-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My partners input to this collaboration is to determine the kinematics of the low-density and high-density gas in the same sample of Infrared-Dark Clouds.

Part of my research results will also be used by the engineers at the SKA Office to design and develop the capabilities of the observatory.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C42B34A-6A17-4E2A-878D-F9EE12F887D9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df4bebc16540.54257086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Massive stars - stars with masses larger than 8 Mo - are known to dominate the energetics and feedback of galaxies since they inject vast amounts of energy in the form of jets/outflows, strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation and supernovae explosions throughout their lives. Despite their importance, the processes that lead to the formation of massive stars remain poorly known. It is currently believed that massive stars form in massive, filamentary and dark molecular clouds (known as Infrared-Dark Clouds or IRDCs). 

The key findings of this period are summarised below:

1) IRDCs show fingerprints of their formation process via cloud-cloud collisions in the form of extended emission from molecules such as silicon monoxide (SiO) and methanol (CH3OH; Cosentino, Jimenez-Serra et al., paper in preparation), and the emission from mid-J rotational lines of carbon monoxide (CO; see Pon et al. 2016a, 2016b).

2) Massive Infrared-Dark Clouds (or IRDCs) show molecular species typical of very cold chemistry in the interstellar medium (e.g. deuterated species such as N2D+), which imply that these clouds represent the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. The derived lifetime for these clouds is 3 Myr, i.e. 8 times longer than the free-fall time-scales. This implies that magnetic fields may play an important role in the formation and evolution of these clouds (Barnes et al. 2016; Zahorecz, Jimenez-Serra et al. 2017, submitted to A&amp;amp;A). 

3) When observed at higher angular resolution with interferometers such as NOEMA and ALMA massive clumps located at the centre of filament-hub systems split up into multiple intra-hub filaments, each of which retains its integrity as an independent structure and possesses its own embedded core population. (Henshaw et al. 2016; McGuire et al. 2016; Henshaw, Jimenez-Serra et al. 2017). 

4) The chemistry of isotopologues of nitrogen in low-density IRDCs (and in particular, the 15N fractionation) resembles that found in low-mass protoplanetary disks and Solar-system bodies, suggesting that our Solar-system may have originated in a low-density IRDC (Zeng, Jimenez-Serra et al., paper under review, submitted to A&amp;amp;A). 
 
5) The detection of complex organic molecules in massive protostars may be produced by the interaction of high-density, low-velocity magneto-hydrodynamic shocks (Wang et al. 2016; Palau et al. 2017).

6) A quarter of the Cold Cores detected with the Plank satellite (belonging to the early release of the Plank Galactic Cold Cores catalogue) are excellent candidates to look for the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation (Zahorecz, Jimenez-Serra et al. 2016). 

7) As part of the preparatory science for ALMA Band 2 and the SKA, I have detected a large number of complex organic molecules (carbon-chain species with more than 6 atoms in their molecular structure) in the Solar-system precursor L1544 (or pre-stellar core). These observations reveal a region located 4000 AU away with respect to the core's centre, which represents the complex organics reservoir in this pre-stellar core (Jimenez-Serra et al. 2016). I have contributed to the ALMA Band 2 White Book (Fuller et al. 2016).

8) I have also contributed to several studies of the chemistry of MHD shocks in molecular outflows in collaboration with the UCL Astrochemistry group, which have provided insight into the processes leading to the chemical complexity found in proto-Sun analogues. These studies have focused on the chemistry of key species for the origin of life, such as water, ammonia, sulphur and phosphorus (Holdship et al. 2016; Gomez-Ruiz et al. 2016; Lefloch et al. 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the field of star formation, my observational work toward IRDCs is expected to provide additional constraints to theories of molecular cloud formation, allowing us to distinguish between flow-driven, cloud-cloud collisions and gravitational collapse scenarios for cloud formation. In particular, the detection of extended emission of SiO and CH3OH suggests that these massive clouds may have formed via cloud-cloud collisions. 

My research regarding the 15N/14N isotopic ratio in IRDCs provides further evidence for the formation of the Solar System in a high-mass star-forming environment with several supernovae explosions. It also constraints the physical properties of such an environment with an average gas density lower than those typically found in IRDCs. These results will be relevant to researchers working in the origin and chemical composition of the solar nebula. 

My work on the chemical complexity in pre-stellar cores will be used by the SKA Office to design and develop the capabilities of the SKA so that this kind of studies can be carried out once the SKA becomes operational. The ultimate goal of the project is to find amino acids at these early stages in the formation of a Solar-type system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>26096FEC-6B46-41BF-B3FE-A41BCEB90916</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dec68140f124.80090910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>I have collected a large dataset of single-dish and interferometric data on the emission of shock tracers such as SiO and CH3OH toward a small sample of Infrared-Dark Clouds.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A96CA68-72EA-4516-AB9A-26D1A0364838</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have imaged for the first time the spatial distribution of the SiO and CH3OH emission in a sample of three IRDCs using the single-dish IRAM 30m telescope. The results from one of the clouds (cloud G) suggest that it may have been formed by a cloud-cloud collision induced by Galactic shear motions. My PhD student Giuliana Cosentino is currently working on a publication to MNRAS to report these results (expected submission in April 2017). 

We have follow-up observations with ALMA (project number 2016.1.01363.S) to image the small-scale structure of the cloud-cloud interaction in two IRDCs (clouds G and H, analysed in pne of my 2010 papers). This project is currently being observed at ALMA and data are expected to be delivered before August 2017. These results will provide key information about the formation processes of massive stars and star clusters.

In addition, by using the bonus lines obtained within the IRAM 30m telescope data, my other PhD student (Shaoshan Zeng) has just submitted a paper to A&amp;amp;A reporting observations on the fractionation of the 15 nitrogen isotopologue (15N) toward a sample of cold cores in our sample of IRDCs. Her results show that the 14N/15N isotopic ratios measured in the less dense IRDC of the sample, cloud G, is comparable to those found in low-mass protoplanetary systems and Solar-system bodies, suggesting that our own Solar-system may have formed in a low-density IRDC. This paper is currently under review and it is expected to be accepted before May 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c16d2c4604c2.27159195</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>IRDCs SiO/CH3OH database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D08C66C-4B82-411F-AB9D-C47F108A05ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>H
