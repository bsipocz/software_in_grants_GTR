For example, on the surface of a round sphere like a football the metric is the same at every point, whereas on a rugby ball the metric is much more curved near the ends than the middle. The football and the rugby ball are the same basic geometric shape (i.e. a sphere) with different metrics, because you can imagine squashing and stretching to transform one to the other. Intuitively the round metric is, in some sense, the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; metric on the sphere. One of the biggest problems in geometry is to find &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; metrics and has been studied for more than a hundred years, yet continues to be at the forefront of modern research. The quest for optimal metrics has led to pioneering research in mathematics and to the development of major new techniques.

An important piece of data associated with a Riemannian metric is its holonomy group. A natural class of optimal metrics are those with so-called special holonomy groups. Two particular examples of geometric objects with metrics with special holonomy are called hyperkaehler and G_2 manifolds (whose dimension has to be a multiple of four or be seven, respectively). Some of the greatest problems in the field are to find examples of these metrics and to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on a given geometric object which ensure the existence of such a metric. The aim of the proposed project is to shed light on these problems using two completely different approaches.

To tackle the problem for G_2 manifolds we intend to follow an elegant approach using a geometric flow. Geometric flow techniques have been employed to prove celebrated results in geometry and topology but are also used in engineering applications, for example Mean Curvature Flow is used as a robust means to remove noise from empirical data such as occurs when obtaining brain images from various scanners. The flow allows us to start with a simpler metric and evolve it so that it approaches the G_2 holonomy metric, in a similar way to how heat dissipates from a heat source. The general equation is very complicated, so we consider the simpler situation where the seven-dimensional objects have symmetries.

The other half of the project, for hyperkaehler and G_2 manifolds, is to consider the boundary value problem. Such boundary value problems arise throughout geometry and analysis, but also occur naturally in physical applications such as modelling bending beams in engineering and interactions between molecules and cells in biology. These problems are typically substantially more challenging than so-called initial value problems, like geometric flows, so we again simplify the problem, now by considering perturbations of a known solution. In this way we aim to identify which deformations of the boundary metric can be extended to define special holonomy metrics and thus hopefully find new examples of such metrics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal seeks to tackle problems for finding distinguished metrics related to special holonomy, specifically in hyperkaehler and G_2 geometry. We intend to solve these problems using techniques from Geometric Analysis and the study of nonlinear partial differential equations governing the geometric phenomena, as well as more algebraic methods and the theory of Exterior Differential Systems. 

Special holonomy is a vibrant and important part of modern mathematics which has connections to diverse areas including: Kaehler geometry, symplectic geometry, higher-dimensional gauge theory and Mirror Symmetry, as well as String Theory in theoretical physics. In studying G_2 geometry we intend to examine the Laplacian flow, which is an exciting developing research area motivated by the study of more familiar geometric flows such as Ricci flow. For hyperkaehler and G_2 geometry we plan to study boundary value problems which, although partially motivated by another geometric flow and related problems with a boundary &amp;quot;at infinity&amp;quot;, essentially form a new avenue of research in the field. Overall, the research outcomes will particularly have potential impact for: solitons and singularity formation in the Laplacian flow, new examples of special holonomy metrics and topological constraints on manifolds with holonomy G_2.

Geometric Analysis is internationally recognised as a powerful and important mathematical tool: within the past 10 years it has enabled the solution of important outstanding problems including the Poincar&amp;eacute; and Geometrisation Conjectures, where geometric flows were used. One of the recommendations of both the most recent International Review of Mathematical Sciences and the EPSRC Pure Maths Workshop (2012) was the need to strengthen and explore connections between Geometry and Analysis, with a specific mention of the link between Geometric Analysis and partial differential equations. As a result the area of Geometric Analysis is starting to develop in he UK, though it is still relatively small in comparison to the size of the international community. The proposed project studies a geometric flow, which is a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation, as well as nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems, so the outcomes of the project will have a significant impact on research on Geometric Analysis in the UK. The visits of Fine and Karigiannis to the UK also have the potential to lead to new collaborations between researchers in Geometry and Analysis.

The theory of Exterior Differential Systems has proven to be an invaluable tool in solving a wide variety of mathematical problems concerning systems of differential equations, and has had particularly striking applications in geometry. However, research using this methodology is very poorly represented in the UK. This proposed project explicitly involves Exterior Differential Systems and a PDRA who will be trained to use these methods, thus providing a fantastic opportunity for UK growth in the implementation of these techniques.

The impact of the proposed project will also be facilitated by the series of two-day workshops and by the planned public engagement event.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233936</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Art and Maths Workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>994D8F30-6D01-44ED-A2C8-0F097BBB2C3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I ran a series of Art and Maths Workshops with artist Lilah Fowler, which had audiences typically ranging from 20-40, usually comprising the general public, but we also ran several for maths teachers.

The PI has hired a postdoc (Yong Wei), as part of the grant, which has led to a very fruitful collaboration concerning the Laplacian flow. We now have a thorough analytic toolkit for studying the flow and have proved important results which control the nature of the flow and help us to understand its long-time behaviour, including the formation of singularities. We also proved a dynamic stability result, which shows that the flow works when it should, and many of the hoped for results one would want from a geometric flow of this type. This had led to three papers which were made available online in 2015 and a further paper made available online in 2016. Two have been accepted in top mathematical journals, with one already in print, and the third is still under review at the top geometry journal. The PI and Yong Wei have been invited to many conferences, workshops and seminars to discuss their work on the Laplacian flow. We are continuing to explore the Laplacian flow and aim to prove further results.

The PI has also worked with collaborators and solved the boundary value problem for special holonomy in 4 dimensions. The PI has given many talks at the topic at prestigious institutions, and his collaborators have also done so, including to mixed mathematical audiences as well as experts. The PI and collaborators have an article on these results accepted for publication in a high quality general interest maths journal. 

The PI has also started a new project looking at the boundary value problem for Ricci-flat metrics in dimension 4, extending the special holonomy problem.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work on the Laplacian flow has already been taken forward by other researchers (e.g. Jorge Lauret) including at least two papers made available online in 2015 and 2016, and researchers working in related areas (such as 4-dimensional geometry).
