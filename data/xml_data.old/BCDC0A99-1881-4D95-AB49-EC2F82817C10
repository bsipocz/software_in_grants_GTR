It will be published as Volume IV of the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift. Intended to replace the current standard edition (Herbert Davis's The Prose Writings of Jonathan Swift (1937-68)), it will be founded on the best current scholarship. The texts will be based on close study of early printed copies and manuscripts, and on current hard-copy and online resources relating to the processes and contexts through which Swift's works reached print. In line with the textual policy established by the general editors of the Cambridge Edition, the texts will in most cases reflect the latest decisions made by Swift during his lifetime. (An exception will be made for works that addressed topical issues or that were answered by other writers at the time, where the first published version, i.e. the one that contemporaries responded to, will be used instead.) Information will be provided about significant differences between the chosen text and other texts that Swift issued at various times. A particularly useful feature for readers will be that, unlike Davis's edition, which has no commentary at all, the new edition will have full explanatory annotation. This will place these works much more comprehensibly in relevant contexts, including not only Swift's life and other writings, and the wider historical situation, but also contemporary debates about the English language, advice books intended to instruct servants in their duties, and astrological writing and almanacs. The notes will make it more practicable for a wide range of twenty-first-century readers to read, understand and enjoy the work of this major writer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This volume of the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift is now being acquired by libraries and individuals, and gives a foundation for new work on and understanding of the previously relatively under-explored works of Swift here presented.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>35DBCBC2-21DF-4FCE-8869-CEB12EE49A69</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>544690f23538c3.58855883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Volume II of the Cambridge Works of Jonathan Swift is entitled Parodies, Hoaxes, Mock Treatises: Polite Conversation, Directions to Servants and Other Works. It presents nearly 40 items, comprising parodies and works generically and thematically associated with them: in addition to the major works signalled in the title, it also includes A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue, the Bickerstaff papers, and a range of smaller pieces. By presenting a full commentary on each work, including the smaller and less familiar ones, the volume makes some of the least familiar parts of the Swift canon newly accessible to scholars, students and the interested general reader. 

I have re-examined the textual transmission of each work through manuscripts and early printed copies, and provided a full textual apparatus, which offers new and substantially revised accounts of the forms in which the works reached their original readers. In order to understand the works in their eighteenth-century contexts, I have studied literary, political, and religious contexts in detail, and have investigated relevant contemporary genres such as commonplace books, astrological controversy, popular prophetic publications, linguistic theory, manuals of advice on conduct and conversation, and writing about servants and their duties. 

The volume begins with a thematic Introduction which presents key results of my work. It focuses, first, on the genres of hoax and parody, putting a case for Swift's parody as not so much a response to kinds of writing that were already well developed in print as a forward-looking projection of cultural trends into an imagined nightmare future. The second part of the Introduction focuses on language, reviewing the serious but frustrated ambition of Swift's Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue alongside the satirical Polite Conversation and Swift's myriad wordgames and puns, which are here read in terms of resistance to notions of linguistic clarity associated with modernising Whig agendas. A characteristic figure in several of the works is a self-satisfied projector or entrepreneur whose ambitions are both ludicrously overweening and exemplary of Swift's fears of modern self-centredness and cultural fragmentation,and the Introduction closes by examining how Swift makes his projectors reveal their values in the language that he puts into their mouths. 

Each work in the main body of the volume has an individual headnote setting out crucial contexts, and is presented with full on-page annotation to make the information easy for readers to use. At the back of the volume, a section of Associated Materials presents relevant fragments, notes and other materials by Swift, and an Appendix deals with cases of disputed attribution, collaborative pieces, and relevant materials by others. A General Textual Introduction discusses basic issues of textual transmission, and introduces the collections in which some of the works first appeared; and Textual Accounts of individual works set out evidence about the manuscripts and early printed forms of each work, displaying and discussing the variations among the various texts. A full bibliography and detailed index allow easy navigation and identification of references.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Volume II of the Cambridge Works of Jonathan Swift, Parodies, Hoaxes, Mock Treatises: Polite Conversation, Directions to Servants and Other Works, will be of use in school and public reference libraries and will be of interest to a wide range of readers interested in the work of Jonathan Swift and in eighteenth-century literature more generally. Its contextualisation of Swift's work in relation to such contexts as almanacs, popular prophecy and writing to and about servants may also be of use to heritage organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EF5F9308-A4FE-4E5E-BD95-A678FDC4B8E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5086792199.95326677634dba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB91E388-5838-4479-BC46-21B426587D0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parodies, Hoaxes, Mock Treatises: Polite Conversation, Directions to Servants and Other Works</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3873397ea1d2b75952da51eb8c55dd01"><gtr:id>3873397ea1d2b75952da51eb8c55dd01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rumbold V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-521-84326-3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54468f536832b6.59463704</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4830DFB5-4A98-42EB-8282-035682020BDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Merlinus Verax, T.
