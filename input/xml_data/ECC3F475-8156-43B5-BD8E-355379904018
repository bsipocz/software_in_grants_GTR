This is predominantly addressed in current public debates in terms of trafficking and exploitation. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Interviews with 100 migrant women, men and transgender people working in all of the main jobs available within the sex industry, and from the most relevant areas of origin (South America, Eastern Europe, EU and South East Asia), suggest that although some migrants are subject to coercion and exploitation, a majority are not. The research shows a great variety of experiences and trajectories within the sex industry, which were influenced by key factors such as:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>social-economic background&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>family history&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>educational aspirations and achievements&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>immigration status and policy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>professional and language skills&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>gender and sexuality&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>individual emotional history.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research findings show that the current emphasis on concepts such as trafficking and exploitation to explain the variety of the trajectories of migrants into the UK sex industry risks concealing their individual and shared vulnerabilities and strengths, the understanding of which could form the basis of more effective social interventions.&lt;/p>

Drawing on original interviews with people working in the sex industry in Albania, Italy and the UK, documentary director and anthropologist Nicola Mai reveals their unheard voices.
In Tirana we meet Besnik, an Albanian young man who uses violence to stop his women getting under his skin. In Rome, Catalin is a Romanian minor selling sex to other men as it's the best job he's ever had. Having used violence in the past, Adrian, a Romanian young man, now respects his working girl to keep himself safe and out of jail. In London there's Candy, a Romanian young woman who loves her trafficker to the point of getting convicted for controlling. Alina, a Moldovan woman, decides to work independently in the UK sex industry after having been trafficked. We also meet Cynthia, a transgender woman selling sex to feed her estranged family while waiting to fix her papers.
These voices often go against the grain of popular expectations that most migrant sex workers are exploited and forced to sell sex against their will. Confronting these attitudes, Normal uncovers a layered, human story of migration and sex work. What we hear are unexpected, disturbing, sometimes moving and often contradictory life stories. The viewer is continually challenged by the truth of their words, their dreams and the lives that they lead. All the characters are portrayed by actors, guaranteeing the anonymity and safety of the original interviewees and emphasizing the inherently performative nature of selves. By choosing to narrate the histories of 'imperfect' victims and villains and by using actors to embody real research interviews and ethnographic settings, Normal also questions humanitarian and scientific notions of authenticity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>54653AF1-4C93-46D7-B1E3-F0555D5518C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mai's film 'Normal' is informed by the combined findings of Mai's research and was selected at the Raindance International Film Festival 2012.

The film has been regularly included in syllabi of teaching modules in Criminology, Gender and Sexuality, Public Health, Anthropology and Sociology at several UK (Leeds, LSE, LSHTM) and international (Paris - EHESS, Nijmegen - Radboud, Columbia University, NY) universities and has impacted on the training of prospective practitioners and policymakers.

? 1 literary review of projects offering existing services to migrant sex workers and other associated literature.
? 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with female migrant sex workers.
? The evaluation adopted a participatory community-based approach, by training one SHOC project worker and by training and employing as peer researchers 2 female sex workers, one British and the other belonging to one of the most significant national groups involved in sex work in Haringey (Lithuania). We also employed a fourth researcher with specific experience of qualitative interviewing and ethnographic observation in the context of the sex industry.

At the beginning of the project, the evaluators meet with SHOC outreach and support staff to consult with them about their understandings of the issues and support needs of migrant sex workers. The Manager of SHOC was also interviewed.

The evaluation team is composed of Dr Nick Mai, the evaluation co-ordinator, and Rosie Campbell, consultant researcher. All of the researchers contributed to the analysis of the findings by commenting on specific interviews and on the final report.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Haringey Council's Drug and Alcohol Action Team (DAAT) commissioned ISET (The Institute for the Study of European Transformation at London Metropolitan University) to explore the extent or otherwise to which female migrant sex workers were 'trafficked' in the London boroughs of Haringey and Enfield and to make recommendations as to the most effective model to identify and respond to the needs of migrant women working in the off-street (saunas, massage parlours, brothels, etc.) sex industry operating in the two boroughs. The project was built onto the existing sex workers project SHOC (Sexual Health On Call), which serves the boroughs of Haringey and Enfield. The evaluation was funded by the Migrant Impact Fund (MIF). 
The key objectives of the evaluation are to:
1. Conduct a literature review of other projects that have successfully worked with this group of women. 
2. Gain a better understanding of the profile of sex workers working in Haringey, and the differences between those who engage with services and those who do not.
3. Assess whether there is a cost benefit to the NHS for funding a specific scheme for migrant sex workers.
4. Assess the effectiveness of the support offered by SHOC against the MIF project objectives.
5. Identify sex workers health (including drug and alcohol use), social, psychological needs.
6. Identify unmet need and gaps in services.
7. Obtain information about how women came to be working in Haringey.
8. Obtain information about women who are trafficked and then accommodated in Haringey.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>In whose name? : migration and trafficking in the UK sex industry : delivering social interventions between myths and reality</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E4F22BB-1B09-48B3-AE92-B03ACEA6631B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Nick Mai was been awarded funding to hold a public event on 31 October at Londonmet as part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science 2011.

The English Collective of Prostitutes used the research in their campaign against the 2009 Policing and Crime Act and 'the increased criminalization of sex workers and the closures of premises justified in the name of clamping down on trafficking'. Following the launch of the research findings, Mai was consulted by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) during the preparation of the 'Setting the Record' report, so far the only official police quantification of sex trafficking in England and Wales, confirming that only a minority of migrant sex workers are trafficked. The findings were presented at the ACPO 2010 and at two of the UKNSWP yearly national conferences in 2009 and 2010. The research completed a tradition of participative and ethnographic research engaging sex workers directly in identifying their needs and priorities. It has 'directly informed policy development at a national level and informed support service practice across the UK' (UKNSWP representative) and was pivotal in producing a forceful impact on current UK government guidelines and strategies on trafficking, which are now separate from those on prostitution and acknowledge that a minority of migrants working in the sex industry are trafficked. The findings of the research inform the influential 2012 report 'Silence on Violence' on the violence experienced by sex workers in London and on the way anti-trafficking campaigns exacerbated their vulnerability.
