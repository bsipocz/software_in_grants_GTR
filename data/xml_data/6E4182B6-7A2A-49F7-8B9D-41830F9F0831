However, there are still several untapped opportunities for cysteine-directed biological investigations as a consequence of the difficulty in distinguishing between free cysteine residues of similar availability, particularly in an expressed and/or unfolded polypeptide chain. In order to take full advantage of the targeting potential that cysteine can provide, it is essential that the various cysteine residues within a peptide sequence can be distinguished from each other. 

Due to the structural similarity between N-epsilon-acetyllysine and 2-acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) we aim to develop the orthogonal t-RNA/RNA synthetase pair from Methanosarcina barkeri (Mb), employed to incorporate N-epsilon-acetyllysine into expressed proteins in response to an amber (TAG) stop codon, to introduce Cys(Acm). Cys(Acm) is compatible with most routine peptide transformations, importantly with metal free dethiylation (MFD), yet is cleaved under mild conditions, enabling discrimination between available cysteine residues regardless of their sequence context. This protection strategy is currently only available in synthetic peptide chemistry, yet here we aim to use fully recombinant precursors that can be generated cost-effectively from renewable resources.

Initially we will randomise Mb tRNA synthetase residues that are proximal to the substrate giving rise to a library of mutant enzymes. Those which can successfully charge Mb tRNA with Cys(Acm) will be amplified and isolated using an established genetic selection. While this progresses we additionally aim to synthesise our protein targets, albeit in simplified form, in order to optimise &amp;quot;late-stage&amp;quot; modification and peptide/protein refolding. Rather than serving as a needless duplication of effort, the synthetic work is designed to create new opportunities for innovation in the protein ligation arena. 

First, the protection/targeting strategy will first be applied to a model therapeutic protein. Expression of this protein with 2 x Cys(Acm) and a single glycosylation site replaced with cysteine allows unambiguous targeting of the glycosylation site with sugar bromoacetamides. Following glycosylation and deprotection of the Acm groups the protein will be oxidatively refolded. Next the process will be applied to designed tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR's). Head-to-tail oligomerisation of these designed repeat proteins has been shown produce a diverse range of protein-protein interaction scaffolds. However the existing strategy is limited by repeated exposure of the growing polypeptide to proteases, and the introduction of one new cysteine residue per native chemical ligation (NCL) step which results in unwanted disulphide bond formation. Following introduction a single N-terminal Acm protected cysteine residue, iterative NCL/MFD reactions obviates the need for repeated exposure to proteases and prevents interference from free cysteine residues as the oligomerisation progresses. Finally, protected Cys residues will be introduced to a single chain insulin analogue. Whether Insulin is produced chemically or biologically the major factor compromising efficiency is the oxidation step to form the disulfide bonds. Consequently, in order to bias formation of a crucial folding intermediate one pair of cysteine residues (corresponding to A7-B7) will be expressed in Acm protected form. Folding will be examined using standard biophysical techniques including NMR and CD spectroscopy, and compared with a synthetic counterpart. 

Successful completion of each model study serves as an important proof of principle and highlights the versatility, and wealth of potential applications for this new addition to the protein toolkit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>With hundreds of therapeutic peptides and proteins on the market, and even more in development, it is clear that this research field will continue to play a significant role in emerging therapeutic areas. This proposal concerns development of a new &amp;quot;apparatus&amp;quot; capable of incorporating 2-acetamidomethylcysteine (3) into biologically produced proteins in response to an amber (TAG) stop codon. A successful outcome has the potential to direct the multiple site-specific modification of large protein hormones with unprecedented reliability, accelerate head-tail cyclisation of polypeptide macrocycles, and assist in the productive folding of cysteine rich peptides and proteins. 

Homogeneous and stable modification of protein hormones is useful for attaching labels and affinity tags, but is also a tried and tested method to increasing their therapeutic potential while reducing dosing regimen and toxicity. When applied to antibodies, this forms the basis of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC's). With a view to lowering production cost and increasing the safety profile of such bioconjugates, more reliable and robust methods are in constant demand. Here, multiple protein sites could be targeted with e.g. PEG simultaneously, without the need for painstaking proteomics analysis to ensure the correct cysteine residues were modified, regardless of whether the protein is folded or completely reduced and denatured to begin with.

Highly optimised peptide synthesis at scale still requires excess regents, stoichiometric coupling reagents, and generates considerable chemical and solvent waste. Furthermore several of the raw materials (protected amino acids) can also be difficult and unreliable to source in sufficiently large quantities. All of these obstacles are overcome through biological protein production. Bacteria are excellent bioreactors and are already employed by several pharma companies for biotransformation purposes, and &amp;quot;clean-up&amp;quot; of contaminated waste effluent streams. They are cheap to culture since they grow in suspension to high optical densities, and produce countless proteins efficiently. 

We anticipate that this research would be of great interest to several large and small pharmaceutical companies with interests in developing protein therapeutics. To promote this type of interaction we would aim to publish our results in high impact publications and attend more industry-based conferences where coal-face issues (stability, commercial viability, sustainability and delivery) dominate the agenda. As a consequence we would hope to find a partner for production of user-led therapies and develop this through follow-on support.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>375298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R008973/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
