Bacteria use protein kinases as sensors of environmental signals. In response to its signal, a kinase transmits information by modifying its substrate protein in a process called phosphorylation. The modified substrate protein then causes appropriate changes in cell behaviour. At the University of Leicester we have uncovered a system where two kinases transmit information by phosphorylating a single substrate 'GarA' and thereby cause a switch in the metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). M. tuberculosis causes the disease tuberculosis (TB). It is able to survive inside the immune cells that kill other bacteria. It is also able to switch between active growth and non-growing forms, depending on whether conditions are favourable. It is estimated that a third of the worlds population may be infected but not show symptoms because the bacteria are non- growing or dormant. We aim to uncover some of the signals that cause M. tuberculosis to alter its metabolism, and deduce how these 'signals' are detected and how they cause appropriate changes in the bacterium itself. We will study M. tuberculosis grown in the laboratory and measure two key parameters: 1. When signaling is active 2. Changes in metabolism under different conditions We will make measurements during active growth, non-growing cultures and the transitions between growth and non- growth. This will allow us to establish when each kinase is active (during growth or dormancy) and which signals might cause kinase activity (nutrients, growth rate etc). M. tuberculosis can be grown in nutrient broth, but its normal environment is the human body - a much more complex system. Human immune cells can be grown in the laboratory and we will use these cells to study the nutritional status and kinase activity of M. tuberculosis growing inside the cells. This research will improve our understanding of information pathways in bacteria, and the differences between growing and non-growing states, as well as how M. tuberculosis survives the immune system to cause disease. Inhibitors of protein kinases might be promising future drugs to treat tuberculosis, but it will be important to know when the kinases are active in order to predict whether such a treatment would be effective in patients who have active or latent disease. What we learn about the protein kinases of M. tuberculosis will also impact on our understanding of the kinases of other bacteria, including environmentally important bacteria and strains used industrially for food and antibiotic production.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Reversible protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous mechanism of signal transduction. Recently eukaryotic-like serine threonine protein kinases have been found to be widespread in prokaryotes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with eleven serine threonine kinases, has become a focus for study of signal transduction. Despite intense international interest, the stimuli that influence kinase activity in M. tuberculosis are completely unknown. We have studied the kinase substrate 'GarA', an abundant metabolic regulator in M. tuberculosis and all sequenced actinobacteria, and have recently been able to measure the physiological phosphorylation state of native GarA in cultured M. tuberculosis using mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS). Unphosphorylated GarA inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle and promotes glutamate synthesis, whereas phosphorylation by protein kinase G or B reverses these effects. Thus the phosphorylation state of GarA serves as a unique reporter of each kinase activity and the conditions the kinases sense. Building on our recently established methods, we will investigate the hypothesis that unphosphorylated GarA is involved in the metabolic changes that occur during adaptation to non-replication. Conversely, stimulation of kinase activity may be one of the key events in re-starting growth and replication. By measuring the phosphorylation state of GarA during these transitions, we will generate the first profile of kinase activities in relation to physiological conditions and hence identify the conditions that stimulate each kinase activity. These studies will provide a paradigm for unravelling the stimuli transduced by this important family of prokaryotic kinases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The University of Leicester is a leading centre of research in the field of signalling and tuberculosis, and 'microbial science' is one of six cross-disciplinary themes specifically supported and encouraged by the University. Continued investment will strengthen and maintain this position of international competitiveness as well as providing training for a PDRA, investing in skills that will benefit the economy in the future. This proposal will have impacts in three specific areas, described in further detail in the impact plan: 1. Public engagement in science This research will impact on the public through the media (by press release of results of studies of general interest) and through personal contact (school outreach and open days). The research will also be available to the science community through publication in high impact peer reviewed journals. 2. Benefits to human health and well-being This research will improve understanding of metabolism and signalling pathways of M. tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The knowledge generated may have downstream applications in treatment of M. tuberculosis since protein kinases are potential new drug targets. 3. Economic benefits Anticipated economic benefits will arise from an improved understanding of the signalling systems of actinobacteria, which include human and animal pathogens as well as industrially important strains. The knowledge generated may improve our ability to control industrially important processes, including the production of amino acids for human and animal consumption and the production of antibiotics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356007</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pasteur Institute, Paris</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pasteur Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>0DFA39B7-179D-442A-BEB6-60F00F124BAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration was strengthened by the award.

The project is still in progress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The vulnerability of M. tuberculosis to disruption of glutamate metabolism could be exploited to develop new drugs to treat tuberculosis.

The GarA regulatory pathway is conserved in other actinobacteria, including industrially useful Corynebacterium and Streptomyces species. Knowledge of their metabolism could be applied to improve the use of these organisms. We are collaborating with Prof Riccardo Manganelli's group at the University of Padua to investigate the essentially of GarA in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
