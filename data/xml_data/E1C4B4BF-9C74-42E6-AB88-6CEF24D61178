Such depth-limited flows always have patterns of small waves on the air/water boundary. We believe that the dynamic behaviour of these small waves carries information about the turbulent mixing and energy losses within that flow. Normally in engineering calculations the water surface is assumed to be flat and so this source of potentially very valuable information is ignored. This project will use laboratory observations and a complex 3D numerical model to study and predict the turbulent flow structures that are created by turbulent flows over rough solid boundaries. These flow structures then rise to the water surface and cause it to oscillate and create a distinct pattern of small waves. The numerical model will be able to predict the generation, growth and transport of these flow structures in 3D, and capture their effect on the water surface pattern. It is believed that by measuring the wave pattern it will be possible to predict the mixing and energy losses within the flow. The numerical model will be used to simulate this process for a wide range of physical scales, bed roughness types and flow depth to width ratios, so that a very wide range of flow regimes will have been examined.The wave pattern on a water surface can be measured using a number of methods; e.g. optical, eletromagnetic and acoustic. Acoustic measurements are particularly suited to hydraulic applications because they are fast, low-cost, non-invasive, and can be easily used at both small and large scales. An airborne acoustic sensor that can project sound energy onto the moving water surface pattern will be placed above the water surface in a channel or pipe. By examining the acoustic reflections, the behaviour of the air-water boundary will be measured. New methods of acoustic signal analysis and sound propagation theory are needed to re-construct the fine detail of the water surface patterns from the measured acoustic reflections. The processed acoustic data will then be combined with the knowledge gained from the laboratory and 3D numerical studies to provide engineers with relationships to estimate energy losses and turbulent mixing solely from measurements of the air-water boundary. Information on energy losses and turbulent mixing is needed to predict water levels for flood studies and to predict the mixing of pollutants and sediments accidentally released into rivers and pipes. This system will be able to improve flood prediction and warning, so providing better protection for people and their property. Better assessment of turbulent mixing in water bodies will help to protect better the natural environment and sensitive habitats. In the final part of the project, a prototype sensor system will be manufactured and tested at full scale in the River Taff, at an Environment Agency test facility. The results will be used to demonstrate the practical applicability of the concept and the technology to end users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>305745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The current project is a part of a joint project between the Cardiff University team and a team at the University of Bradford led by Professor Simon Tait (EP/G015341/1). The Cardiff team has developed 3-D large eddy simulation model to simulate coherent flow structures in shallow water flows, and the interactions these features have with the bed surface roughness and surface water waves. The main outcome of the project was the development of an acoustic-based systems capable of the remote measurement of bed friction of shallow water flows from rapid scanning of the air/water interface. This technology will have a wide range of potential applications, e.g. improved accuracy in modelling riverine flows (particularly with flooding), catchment and floodplain surface hydrologic predictions, improved predictions of flow in partially filled pipes, estuarine hydrodynamics for unsteady frictional flows over intertidal reaches and water quality/turbidity predictions in turbulent flows.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B747D45C-B965-4033-991A-389266BA8B95</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e12395ca2226.66127320</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A LES model has been developed to predict shallow water free surface flows. The dynamic sub-grid scale model is employed in the model, with the partial cell treatment being implemented on a Cartesian grid to represent the bed topography. The VOF method is used to capture the moving water surface. Model simulations have been undertaken to get a better understanding of coherent flow structures in shallow water flows, and the interactions these features have with the bed surface roughness and surface water waves. There are four main project findings. 



(1) The movement of water surface has a significant effect on the distributions of turbulence intensities and the Reynolds stresses along the water depth. 



(2) For very shallow water flows the value of predicted surface fluctuations is in an order of 1% of the water depth. As the submergence ratio increases, a larger velocity is required to maintain the level of fluctuation. 



(3) Three-dimensional dunes induce a system of counter-rotating secondary currents, directing high-speed fluid downwards and low-speed fluid upwards. 



(4) In regular-shaped compound channels the temporal and spatial velocity fields are significantly different at different cross sections, but their time-averaged secondary velocity distributions are similar.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from the research potentially can be used to develop equipment for rapid measurement of bed roughness in shallow rivers and channels. This would help river managers and engineers to determine flow rates, which would be very useful in flood risk assessment. The new understanding of shallow water flows could also be used to develop new software to enable improved predictive capability to be developed. The research findings have been presented to Yorkshire Water and Halcrow through regular meetings during the whole project period. The findings have also been presented in three international conferences and submitted to three international journals, with one published, one in print and one under review. 

The main outcome is the development of an acoustic-based systems capable of the remote measurement of bed friction from rapid scanning of the air/water interface. This is developed at Bradford University and the exploit routes are described in the report by the Bradford team.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DC3B8FA0-01A2-4D15-9F16-6FC3F26CD1C0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3725428379.8164024779312a2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC3E5A9E-A09A-4DB6-8947-DA9F04D39219</gtr:id><gtr:title>Large-eddy simulation of turbulent open-channel flow over three-dimensional dunes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Hydraulic Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc"><gtr:id>580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xie Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_3835437082136b686e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36FB6F60-6033-4659-9EFC-9F983DDD956F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Cartesian grid method for shallow water flows over a gravel bed</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f9e030bd924303fc8b3bf0832664444c"><gtr:id>f9e030bd924303fc8b3bf0832664444c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhihua Xie (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_9902856155140bdc86</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BAE38C84-6183-4B62-A71A-D2ABC78719FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Turbulence characteristics in free-surface flow over two-dimensional dunes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Hydro-environment Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc"><gtr:id>580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xie Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_8832589473136b692c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>83BCC3E4-2C3E-4599-BB2B-43FDCEE13021</gtr:id><gtr:title>Large-eddy simulation of the turbulent structure in compound open-channel flows</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Water Resources</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc"><gtr:id>580de079e95ef5478e5bf669104c2adc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xie Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe2fe24304c36</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3051FCD2-A11D-4E5B-9FA8-ECB60339BA0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>LES of flow over 3D dunes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f9e030bd924303fc8b3bf0832664444c"><gtr:id>f9e030bd924303fc8b3bf0832664444c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhihua Xie (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_4374472836140bdd30</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C56C4BD-F9A7-4734-8772-B18186A0C689</gtr:id><gtr:title>Development of a 3-D non-hydrostatic model for free surface flows</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9e617e40e3c3d52145d09adbdfa51d50"><gtr:id>9e617e40e3c3d52145d09adbdfa51d50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ulrich R.
