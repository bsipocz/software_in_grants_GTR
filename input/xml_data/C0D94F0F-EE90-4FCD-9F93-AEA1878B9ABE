Design</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M001296/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will be a collaboration with community partners to co-design and evaluate new approaches to consultation. Consultation, the engagement of communities in public service decision making becoming an increasingly important part of local and regional life, with moves to help communities be more active and connected to their wider environment. This encouragement of ground up activity reflects a groundswell of new community, friends and special interests groups forming across the UK. It is also recognised by national government with legislation such as the Localism Bill (2011) laying out a sweeping agenda for empowering communities, e.g. giving residents the power to instigate local referendums on any local issue.

Public bodies have always been involved in consultation with their communities and there is a strong desire for this to increase in the future and to support communities in playing a larger, more active role in society. This need (and desire) for more consultation coincides in dramatic reductions of Council funding. In the last 3 months one of the public sector partner departments we work with has been reduced from 22 to 4 people. Clearly new consultation practices are needed to accommodate both the opportunity presented by the demand for more consultation and a quite different funding landscape. Leapfrog will help create and evaluate these new models, working initially with test beds in Lancashire and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and then more broadly across the UK. Lancashire has closely packed overlapping communities that are hard to engage, e.g. with low rates of English literacy. The Highlands and Islands communities are very geographically dispersed and isolated and are strongly motivated to innovate by the hardships they face in terms of communications and access. Working across these two test-beds will stress test our new consultation approaches and help make them more robust when applied in other parts of the UK.

We will develop these new approaches through a process of co-design. This involves collaboration with communities and public sector partners where all parties play an active role in the creative process (Cruickshank et al 2013). Communities will engage in a co-design process that results in a range of new consultation tools that specifically meet their local needs. For us a tool is something that, with skill, can be used to make wonderful, diverse, creative things (just like a real physical tool). In this proposal we are developing tools to help all people create their own amazing consultation processes.

Our consultation tools will be used by communities directly, they will also be exchanged with other communities who will be encouraged to appropriate and adapt these tools to fit their own needs. Tools could be physical, digitally downloaded and printed or entirely digital in nature. We will use these tools to develop toolboxes containing a themed set of tools (e.g. consultation without writing, for groups with low levels of English literacy). We will produce at least 50 of each of the 5 toolboxes we produce. We will seed these toolboxes in at least 80 communities and public sector bodies across the UK.

Underpinning all our actions, from co-design to innovation in local consultation to widely distributed toolboxes will be a series of new evaluation frameworks. These will be used to understand the real value and impact of the new tools. With strong guidance from Gareth Williams, our applied ethicist, these evaluation frameworks will be designed to be unobtrusive but also to examine activities in terms that make sense and are seen as valuable to communities. Rather than evaluation being something that is 'done to' communities this will also be a collaborative, mutually beneficial shared process.

Cruickshank, Coupe and Hennessy, 'Co-Design: Fundamental Issues And Guidelines For Designers: Beyond the Castle Case Study', Swedish Design Research Journal no 2, 2013. page 4</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the Pathways to Impact document we identify 5 key types of impact and how the actions within the project will achieve these impacts. Here we expand on the definition and explanation of these impacts.

i1) To transform our public sector partners` ability to co-design, consult and engage with communities. This will be manifest in new tools, approaches and practices but will be driven by a change in culture of how these institutions think about engagement: Public services need to do more and more effective consultation with diminishing resources. We will help our partners to transform their consultation and engagement practices. We will do this through the collaborative creation of new tools with a focus on hard to reach groups such as teenagers and the socially disengaged. The use of these tools will be complimented by helping partners develop the skills to use the tools in their own, creative ways. These skills and successful new consultation activities will start to build a culture of innovation and peer-to-peer exchange within the council and other public sector partners.

i2) To have a material economic benefit for public sector participants by making consultation more effective and reducing the need to employ external consultants: Public services often use external consultants to undertake activity with communities. Inevitably these consultants are costly and somewhat dislocated from the communities they are working with. The aim of the tools and toolboxes designed as part of Leapfrog is to give public sector workers a greater capacity to do more and better consultation themselves and that communities can be much more self sufficient in undertaking their own consultation (see i3). An important result of these new tools is that our public sector partners will have to employ external consultants less often, offering a significant cost saving. On reviewing our plans for Leapfrog, our public sector partners predict that this will result in a saving of over &amp;pound;500,00 over the duration of the project.

i3) To transform the ability of local community partners to organise, form effective groups, to productively 'self consult' and engage more actively and productively with the issues most relevant to them': Our tools will help local communities have a more effective voice. This will help community groups at all stages of maturity. For emerging groups it could be to help a loose collection of people to form into a coherent group with the tools and experience to back up their aspirations with evidence of the strength of feeling in the community (self consultation). For more developed community groups our tools could provide the key to unlocking lottery and heritage funding. Successful applications to these funding sources depends on evidence of a real groundswell of community feeling. Our tools will give community groups the ability to understand and evidence their communities` feelings more effectively and reliably.

i4) Provide a strong impetus for the improvement of consultation, engagement practices and approaches nationally (and internationally): We will enable this through the creation of numerous tools (digital, physical and hybrid) and 5 distinct toolboxes. These will be promoted and freely distributed across the UK to community groups, local authorities and other public services, with active seeding of tools in over 80 groups and an open platform for the free distribution of tools.

i5) To help any group or institution that undertakes consultation activities to understand, evaluate and improve their engagement activities: Good evaluation of engagement and consultation in the private sector is both critically important and rare. The innovative, unobtrusive, creative evaluation frameworks we develop and share will enable any public consultation process to be evaluated more effectively.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>991633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>It's difficult to find effective and appropriate ways to encourage young people to attend consultations and stay engaged throughout the process. It is also hard to make sure the right language to use with young people.

The Right Ideas is a collection of tools including The Right Words, The Right Opinions and The Big Idea that can be used together or separately with young people to help them find the right words to express their opinions and help them to generate ideas that other young people can respond to. This means that the young people receive ownership of the process and therefore more likely to continue to engage. 

The three tools can be used separately depending on the context or together with either the same or different groups of people over the stages of consultation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E5E61F1-8DEC-4890-86AB-DB6F190046AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool was used at Lancaster City Council's Local Plan consultation event for future employment and housing for young people on 25th November 2015 for evaluation of the event. A qualitative evaluation interview conveyed that using the tool made for a very engaging process where feedback that the young people gave will be written into policy. The Right Ideas tool was also used at a 'Pupil Power Event on the 29th June 2015, a half day event at the Town Hall with six form pupils and district councillors, hosted by the local mayor to good effect. Other events the tool has been used at are a National Citizens Student Service full day event for 16-17 year olds. Another detailed evaluation case study showed The Right Words tool being used by Lancaster Arts with a group of young people asking them to think broadly about creating workshops. In this instance the tool allowed the young people to set the question themselves, which had a very positive effect where they felt much more enfranchised and engaged in the process. The tool helped the young people to feel that the project was about and for them, as opposed to something that they felt part of but don't have ownership over.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af27a209dd08.93058070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Right Ideas (LU MP1)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/tool/the-right-ideas/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Grid is a Leapfrog tool to create interactive grids anywhere, on any surafce, indoors or outdoors.

Target Control has been used over 500 times to gather both adults and young people's views on a variety of topics such as health and wellbeing, loneliness and isolation, mental health and domestic abuse. Target Control has been very effective in a pupil referral unit and in schools. School counsellors and health and social care tutors have also been using Target Control with young people. Evaluation shows that once a school counsellor uses a tool and sees an improvement in someones behaviour there is a ripple effect and feedback from young people is always really positive. Target Control has been used with boys with anger management issues. The tool managed to really engage them with reflective breakthrough moments for the child participants due to &amp;quot;the way the tool made him think&amp;quot;. The family support worker felt the dialogue had been transformed using the Leapfrog tool. The tool changed how the child thought and enabled them to genuinely reflect on the own behaviour and situation. The family worker described this as a profound experience for them and indeed the child. 

Many of the the groups that have used Target Control have been asylum seekers, refugees, homeless residents, LGBT community and men. A lot of these groups are seldom heard, sometimes vulnerable and hard to engage with. The tools allow for a creative engagement and for them to share their views in a way they are able to. Tools normally give control to the practitioner. Leapfrog tools when evaluated give control back to the end user and helps to enable them make decisions to change their lives. 

Target Control has also been used by independent reviewing officers who are responsible for chairing children's review panels and ensuring their views are included in their reviews and care planning. Both Target Control and Storyboard contract have been used to bring the children's voice and views to review meetings and have been an excellent way for young people put their ideas access and bring an element of fun to the discussion. It can be difficult for young people to meet with professionals and give their views if asked directly. Officers have found that tools can make it more fun and non threatening. The Safeguarding unit are working closely with partners to encourage them to understand the meaning of participation in their own reviews. They have been surprised by the willingness of other professionals and foster carers to try new approaches and support new ways of holding child centred reviews that aim to be more relaxed and focussed on the child's needs. Feedback on using the tools has been very positive.

After creating one from a flat sheet of paper, you use your hands to pinch the four sections together either lengthways or across to reveal a second layer. Unfold this part of the layer to discover your fortune in the centre.

Word Play uses the same origami as a tool for people to make, share and exchange with others. It aims to tackle the challenge of translating language between young people and public services both ways. Word Play can be a fun activity for young people and adults working in public services to use together to share the meanings they have for particular words associated with a consultation topic and break down barriers.

Our take on the origami fortune teller includes a simple A4 template with cut-off section with step-by-step instructions for how to fold Word Play that can be printed and given out to a group of young people. There is an A4 set of facilitator notes that gives suggestions on how to structure Word Play so that it either gives the definitions of terms used in consultation or by young people or as a way to share and explain an idea based around a consultation topic</gtr:description><gtr:id>D96C4939-DD73-4DCC-9446-B32B0F0B85A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Word Play was used by the Advocacy and Engagement Officer at Trafford Council at the 'Let's Talk Primary 2016' conference for primary school pupils from 13 different schools with 90 children.

It has been particularly successful in encouraging young people to open up about their lives, their experience of local services and local provision and where interventions can be designed into services. It has been used to look at relationships, body image, homelessness and in a project with people with sensory impairment and a domestic abuse workshop with 120 young people. A pupil referral unit were shocked at how engaged the young people were when using the Storyboard Contract tool. A family Support Worker told of a boy who was at the point of being permanently excluded from school due to very poor behaviour and who refused to do any work or engage in any activities that had the qualities of work. Using the Storyboard Contract led to the child engaging and a deeper conversation and drew the boy into wanting further contact with the support worker. Psychological analysis of the storyboard was suggested by the school headteacher. In subsequent weeks the same boy asked for specific help. The tool gives young people the freedom to make it their own without &amp;quot;asking for something&amp;quot;. 

Health watch Blackburn with Darwen volunteer facilitators have taken up the tools very successfully and found the tools very easy to pick up, adapt and use with minimal training. Healthwatch work closely with Public Health at Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and their engagement findings using the tools influence policy. Young people have been trained to use the Leapfrog tools with other young people which has been very effective.

Sharing co-design methods and tools for engagement, in July 2016 the Summer School aimed to develop Early Career Researchers' (ECRs) capabilities in carrying out Action Research with communities and to stimulate discussion and debate around the academic and societal impact of these approaches. Taking place at the Institute of Design Innovation at The Glasgow School of Art in Forres, Moray, 20 delegates from fields of design, architecture, health and social care, and community development took part in a series of paper presentations, discussions, and creative workshops to enrich their understandings and applications of Action Research in community settings. Featuring presentations from the wider Leapfrog team, the Summer School also welcomed a series of international speakers who delivered keynotes and lightning talks across the event. Areas of discussion included Action research, participation, and co- production with communities; design-led methods and tools in Action Research; relationships, power, and ethics; engaging with diverse and minority communities; moving across disciplinary boundaries; case studies of research with the public, private, and third sectors; innovative research outputs; collaborative evaluation and dissemination; and the value, impact, legacies, and sustainability of these approaches This program of activities offered an inspirational and supportive space for a network of ECRs to exchange insights on broader aspects of research and career development, including approaches to generating research questions, writing research bids, and dissemination to diverse public audiences, and to consider how they might work together in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>39463BA3-F12A-42B0-94E5-2F169F5D7AEA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Aiming to provide an insight into the experience of participating in a Leapfrog Summer School, the film was launched in February 2016 to accompany and promote the current call for participation in the 2017 Summer School, taking place in July at Lancaster University under the theme of Exploring Community Engagement for Research: Power, Impact, &amp;amp; Collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2771d088bb5.86496710</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Leapfrog Summer School 2016: Action Research, Engagement, &amp; Co-design - Event Film</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://player.vimeo.com/video/204044871</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Seeing things is a creative tool that uses set of cards that focus on the WHO, WHAT and WHERE of a community issue.

Six-month evaluation interviews have just been completed with a number of the people who participated in the workshop. The data from these interviews await comprehensive analysis. However, some early indications would suggest that there is greater impact on creative engagement for individual engagement practitioners who have some technical proficiency with MS PowerPoint. 

For instance, one individual has reported regular use of the tool which has enabled participants to respond actively and with equal depth in focus groups for public health research, allowing participants to become more autonomous in the group while the facilitator takes a less directive role. Another individual in a different engagement team is gradually building a library of customised templates for different consultations for other members of her team to quickly grab and go at a later date. For those with less technical proficiency, while they can see the potential benefit of it, they may not have yet used the tool. This is because the opportunity has not yet arisen. For another individual, there appears to be a tendency towards using the physical components of the tool in a mode adapted from the original intended use of the tool, in combination with other techniques to get a greater depth of information quickly from a group of young people than normal. A number of partners have reported that they either have received a greater depth of information during consultation than before or that they can see that the tool has the potential for this. 

For the Leapfrog team, people's experience of using the tool is offering insight into where people experience technological and time barriers in order to meet the following combination of challenges: 1. conceptualising the nature of the engagement (ie what information do they want to find out from people); 2. initiating and completing the design of a tool, and; 3. technical production. Given this challenge, all partners have pointed to the need for more stories and examples of the tool being used within the Leapfrog community of engagement practitioners to give confidence, inspiration as well as more completed ready-made templates for those who have less time or inclination to make and adapt their own tools.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c20cb9985394.99945238</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>(LU SP2) Make It Stick</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/tool/make-it-stick/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Comms Stretcher and Comms Focus encourages teams to think creatively about communication for different communities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A361AA3D-DE9E-4143-AE9A-4ACEA9A19DE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool was shared in an event with over 20 librarians and professionals from other services within Lancashire County Council in January 2017.

The participants were from various teams within their organisations and in some cases were invited as external partners too. Following on, 10 of the 18 participants involved have taken the time to complete both design research and evaluation interviews to reflect on their experience of: 1. attending the workshop and; 2. making and using the tool, and what impacts either of these might have made since.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This short project led on from LU SP1. To shape the project and meet existing need in the growing Leapfrog community, the PhD candidate Hayley Alter designed the research project with input from public sector partners from across the region who engage often with the members of the public interacting with the services they represent. Hayley liaised with those partners to organise, develop and facilitate 5 technical workshops to 18 participants in total at their places of work. The workshop was designed to both exchange ideas and transfer new skills specific to co-designing new variations of the Make It Stick tool in different contexts. We also supported partners to market the workshops to their own teams and networks. Hayley produced supporting materials to guide people in creating and we also provided packs of free blank sticker sheets ready for use which form the physical component of the tool.

Practitioners identified Seeing things tool as a creative, attractive and relatively simple tool to use. The tool was used by our partners with the communities in Cairngorms National Park to identify future engagement exercises.

We worked with our project partner Cairngorms National Park Authority from February 2016 from organising scoping workshops to co-design session and testing tools. One of their main concern in engaging with the communities was that their activities are not reaching the right people and they would like to reach out to the unusual suspects within the Cairngorms communities. Along with other public sector and third sector organisations such as Aberdeenshire Council, Angus Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Tomintoul and Glenlivet Development Trust, Marr Area Partnership and Voluntary Action in Badenoch and Strathspey who work with the National Park we co-designed the Seeing Things tool.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mull &amp; Iona Community Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Peer to Peer Engagement (GSA MP1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>A30A1641-EFBD-4A05-B429-E9A978CBB406</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2 co-design project proposals, scoped and underway.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56a68ae8ebf955.87337505-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our major partners during the scoping phase of our first major project were the community broadband Scotland adviser for Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the community assets sector lead also for Highlands and Islands Enterprise. They were extremely valuable partners for us who brought their expansive knowledge of community engagement issues across Scotland and unique insight into the activities and people that would be key for us to engage with for a successful future co-design project. 

The partners met with us initially to exchange knowledge, conceive and develop the idea for our major project. Our partners came together for an exploratory scoping workshop where they helped us to define the boundaries for our projects, and were instrumental in selecting the community led initiatives we would go on to partner for co-design workshops. They also assisted us with recruitment for future workshops.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The first major project for the Glasgow School of Art team engages with community led initiatives in isolated islands communities to develop peer to peer engagement tools to support community projects. Tools that can be used in and by communities to engage people in development plans for their local area and crucially maintain engagement in projects once they have begun. Through the project we hope to embed practices that will lead to sustainable community led and owned projects. With a large spread of islands communities around the Scottish coast it was important for us to scope the right partners who would help generate great engagement tools and have the biggest impact. To help us gain the right insights into potential community partners the Glasgow team, including the Co-I and RA, hosted a series of scoping workshops with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, our key partner in this project. We worked with their project officers to highlight some of the most pressing issues around developing and sustaining community projects. During these sessions we designed a framework to support our decision making process when looking at projects to partner with and scoped out the most promising 'leads' for us to follow up.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Child Action Northwest</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Co-Design with Young People (LU MP1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>E4CF9D95-835A-48B0-A593-536EA97DBFAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>List tools here and newspaper - to do.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56657a9bd79f09.52821823-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners took responsibility for the recruitment, safeguarding and health and safety assessments for the Residential.

This project will work with key stakeholders in the public sector but also, and critically young people themselves to co design new tools for engagement. In the second phase of the 'Working With Young People' project we collaborated with the Children and Young Peoples Participation Officer within the Safeguarding Unit in the Children's Services Department at Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council. (BBWD). Also Child Action Northwest (CANW) who work with over 6000 children, young people and families in the North West of England every year. 
Over several meetings with BBWD and CANW Leapfrog we formed a partnership that would co-design with a group of vulnerable young people, to design ways their voices could be involved in the decisions that affect them. Lancaster University led the development and delivery of the co-design workshops and funded the residential accommodation. Leapfrog recruited a highly experienced facilitator Dee Hennessy who is passionate and experienced at working with vulnerable young people to lead the co-design programme with young people.

This is detailed under 'Publications'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>566076a30b68d3.77116353-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Before the focus of the Young People's project was confirmed, two City Council officers met with Leapfrog to discuss the potential collaboration and input into the project. They also attended a scoping session at the university along with other people from different organisations to frame the focus of the research project. 

Five Lancaster City Council Officers participated in three co-design events in August. They were the: Public Realm Development Manager, Public Realm Assistant for Environmental Services, the Lancaster Children's Trust Coordinator, the Tenant Participation Officer and the council's Consultation and Engagement Officer. The group also met inbetween events to discuss ideas and come up for ideas for tools themselves. The officers also attended a tools show and tell event to see and try out the final tools in October 2016. 

The officers are currently trialing the tools with young people when they have engagement events and activities. They agreed to help Leapfrog evaluate the tools and the impact they have on their engagement processes with young people.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>ImaginationLancaster's first major research project (LU MP1) asks the question 'How can ideas and information be translated in a more effective way as they move back and forth between the public sector and young people?' The overall project and research question was developed by Leapfrog through a series of meetings and a scoping session with people who deliver services and create Policy relating to young people's services. 

In this first phase of the 'Working With Young People' project we invited Officers from Lancaster City Council who deliver frontline services to young people to a series of co-design events. Within their roles there is often a requirement to engage and consult with young people to ensure services are designed to meet the needs and preferences of young people. 

During the co-design phase with Service Deliverers three afternoon Leapfrog Co-design events were held at ImaginationLancaster during August 2016. The information and outcomes of these events informed the creation of three tools for engagement with young people (reported under 'Artistic and Creative Products'). The Service Deliverers returned to see and try out the final tools in October. The Scoping Session and co-design events are reported in detail under the 'Engagement Activities' section.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancashire County Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>LU Major Research project 2: Collaboration with Lancashire County Council - Neighburhood Centres Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>00AD8382-A1FE-4DB2-9D25-5AE20A093C24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>7 tools have resulted from this project, which are also reported under Artistic and Creative products. These tools will be used across Lancashire in the process of creating new Neighbourhood centres in 2017 and beyond. They will also be shared more widely with public sector and community partners looking to create multi-use spaces. The collaboration was multi disciplinary involving Senior Management in Lancashire County Council Library service and also a representative sample of senior management and employees from other services using the new spaces, in particular Libraries, Museums, Culture and Registrars, Wellbeing, Prevention and Early Help Service and Asset Management being responsible for the establishment of Neighbourhood Centres.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898884516fd36.42244631-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Lancashire County Council, particularly the Head of Libraries, Museums, Culture and Registrar supported Senior Management to scope and collaborate on the project with Leapfrog. Senior Management recruited a team of 28 committed, motivated LCC professionals from across many services to work on the co-design project. In total LCC employees attended 10 Leapfrog events. 3 of the full day co-design workshops took place at County Council libraries for which there was no room hire charge. County County professionals brought their expertise of running libraries, childrens services, faciliites and engaging with communities to the project. The co-design team also worked on their tool ideas inbetween events in work time. Senior Management maintained communication with Leapfrog's Principal Investigator and Design Manager in meetings outside the co-design process to ensure good communication and to plan for the project and tools to have a long term impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project aimed to develop a series of tools and approaches that can be used to enable the best possible transition from libraries to multi-stakeholder neighbourhood centres. Leapfrog developed the project proposal, aims and objectives with the Senior Management team of Lancashire County Council. Leapfrog organised a series of scoping and co-design workshops from June - December 2016 that took LCC professionals through a detailed co-design process. Many of these events were held at Lancaster University and Leapfrog provided all catering and materials for the project. Leapfrog brought expertise and knowledge of designing tools for creative engagement to the project. The final tools were shared with the County Council in January 2017.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Third Sector Interface Moray</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gathering Stories Through Evaluation Tools (GSA SP2)</gtr:description><gtr:id>429557BF-A624-43BD-B9D3-DCF845B8F50D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We co-designed and developed the Evaluation Game Tool as a part of the GSA Short Project 2 along with our partners (tsiMoray, Moray Art Center, Moray Council and Eden Court Creative). Following the successful use of the Evaluation game tool, we have organised evaluation tool delivery workshops within the Highlands and Islands which opened up more dissemination opportunities such as NHS Scotland, Evaluation Support Scotland, Keith Youth Community, Health Care Scotland and Mental Health, Moray, Greater Pollok Integration Network, Edinburgh Women's Aid and many more. 

So, far 25 Evaluation Game tool has been used by practitioners from various organisations. We have evaluated the tool use as a part of the project's interim evaluation. From the analysis, it was identified that the Game has transformed the way some of the practitioners did the evaluation. One of the practitioners from 'Greater Pollok Integration Network' said her user groups were more engaged and helped them to open up and have a discussion with other participants. Another practitioner from TSI Moray had been using the tool for the last 14 months with her user groups and has reported during the interim evaluation that the tool has helped her to gain a deeper understanding of her user groups. Another practitioner from Edinburgh Women's Aid used the Game with vulnerable young people who had witnessed domestic abuse.

The partners met with us initially to exchange knowledge, conceive and develop the idea for our major project. Our partners came together for an exploratory scoping workshop where they helped us to define the boundaries for our projects, and were instrumental in selecting the community led initiatives we would go on to partner for co-design workshops.

Tools that can be used in and by communities to engage people in development plans for their local area and crucially maintain engagement in projects once they have begun. Through the project we hope to embed practices that will lead to sustainable community led and owned projects. With a large spread of islands communities around the Scottish coast it was important for us to scope the right partners who would help generate great engagement tools and have the biggest impact. To help us gain the right insights into potential community partners the Glasgow team, including the Co-I and RA, hosted a series of scoping workshops with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, our key partner in this project. We worked with their project officers to highlight some of the most pressing issues around developing and sustaining community projects.

The event concluded with an invitation for Leapfrog to deliver a workshop with Elgin Youth Caf&amp;eacute; and Community Health and Social Care Partnership to train practitioners in using the tools for engaging with young people which we will organise this Summer.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b57b8b580c60.49876816</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/sharing-the-young-peoples-tools-in-scotland/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tool Sharing with Service Deliverers (LU MP1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>88783C45-086B-45B8-BE3C-B58397143884</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In August 2015, Leapfrog ran a series of co-design workshops with a group of consultation experts from the public sector, referred to within the project as the 'service deliverers', who engage with young people in their work to inform things such as the development of public services, spaces and policy. The aim of these workshops was to imagine new ways to engage with young people and improve how ideas are translated between the young people and the public sector. Many ideas came out of the workshops but three were selected by the service deliverers to be developed further by the Leapfrog project. The tools that were created are called The Right Ideas, Wordplay and Everybody.

The service deliverers joined us to see and experience the tools for the first time. Following a recap of the process with photographs, the group discussed about what they thought were the best bits, what was most challenging and if anything had surprised them.

Jennifer Milligan, Consultation and Engagement Officer said:
&amp;quot;the process showed us that we do have those ideas, they are in there somewhere. It helped pull them out and gave us that space.&amp;quot;

The group agreed that the opportunity to come together, in a different space and go through a detailed co-design process had really helped them to pull out their ideas.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1ef2ac35ea6.55824569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/tool-show-and-tell-with-consultation-experts/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scoping with policy makers (LU MP1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E63FC23F-E7F5-41FE-BAD5-2C7D41DEFBFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In September 2015, the Leapfrog team held a scoping workshop for policy makers at Lancashire City Council. This scoping session with policy makers was the first step in a co-design process to help policy makers translate the results of creative engagement and also to communicate the effects of new policy to young people. In this session there was a great deal of positivity in the room about the need to consult with young people but this was placed in a framework of incredible time pressure and demands by management to produce policy quickly. One of the overriding requests was something to help policy makers communicate to others where consultation could contribute to policy development.

Through this event we have made several connections with policy makers who continue to be involved with the project and are shaping future projects with us.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1edc9c529b3.62985413</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/policy-makers-and-young-people-engagement-scoping-and-information-gathering/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/developing-the-tools-for-exploring-creative-processes-for-engagement-session-2/ (LU SP5)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4ADFFF0-C87D-475B-98FF-381FAD642689</gtr:id><gtr:impact>After the first co-design session Sarah had had time to reflect on the session, the pre-tools generated together, and had prototyped them in test interviews with a few colleagues.

Taking place at the Institute of Design Innovation at The Glasgow School of Art in Forres, Moray, 20 delegates from fields of design, architecture, health and social care, and community development took part in a series of paper presentations, discussions, and creative workshops to enrich their understandings and applications of Action Research in community settings. Featuring presentations from the wider Leapfrog team, the Summer School also welcomed a series of international speakers who delivered keynotes and lightning talks across the event. 

Areas of discussion included Action research, participation, and co- production with communities; design-led methods and tools in Action Research; relationships, power, and ethics; engaging with diverse and minority communities; moving across disciplinary boundaries; case studies of research with the public, private, and third sectors; innovative research outputs; collaborative evaluation and dissemination; and the value, impact, legacies, and sustainability of these approaches 

This program of activities offered an inspirational and supportive space for a network of ECRs to exchange insights on broader aspects of research and career development, including approaches to generating research questions, writing research bids, and dissemination to diverse public audiences, and to consider how they might work together in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2695b11fb65.02368494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/project/leapfrog-summer-school-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LU MP2 - Tool Refinement Meeting for Comms Stretcher, Building Success &amp; Small Things</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71515E75-5DA2-4023-A40F-8DBBD2D98ADD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Anita, Elaine and Alison returned to Lancaster University to refine the tools they have co-designed to be used primarily in neighbourhood centres and re-structured libraries in the county.

During the morning, CANW led a session for practitioners from a wide range of organisations and backgrounds on why listening to and involving young people in decisions that affect them is so important and how this is promoted in law, policy and guidance such as United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child where Article 12 characterises participation work. CANW believe a creative approach and the use of tools can bring real benefits when engaging with young people. The Leapfrog afternoon session was ideally placed to lead on from the mornings activity by giving practitioners the opportunity to try out and adapt tools that could be used to engage a wide range of ages. 

The team introduced the group to Leapfrog, talked about the work our group of young people recruited by CANW, including The Inspirer tool newspaper produced as a result, and shared four tools; Make It Stick, Everybody, Target Control and Storyboard Contract.

The group had the opportunity to be hands on with each of the tools and discuss together how they might adapt the tools for their own needs. The Leapfrog team were blown away by how many ideas the group had and how quickly they became absorbed in changing the tool templates we had brought with us.

The participation practitioners will be sent a copy of the Inspirer tool newspaper as soon as we receive it from the printer so that they can try out their new ideas.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1f087cf7863.45799848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/participation-practitioners-generate-many-ideas/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young Designers Celebration Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E7B9889-13FD-4F33-976A-09784B3426EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Leapfrog celebrated the achievement of the young designers in the major project by holding a Celebration Event at Blackburn Museum last week.

We looked at the ideas carefully before each member of the group chose their favourites to develop further, paired with a member of the Leapfrog team. Everyone discussed and critiqued the ideas again. We then asked each member of the group choose one to develop further, this time filling in a pro-forma that asked for a name for the tool, a compelling reason to make the tool, who would use the tool and what resources the tool would need. These refined ideas were then presented to the group.

Following this, everyone rated each of the ideas on adaptability, how cool it was for young people, if it allowed the facilitator to do things they could not do before and/or do more and if there was an instinct to make it. This enabled us to get a clear idea of which tools were preferred in the group.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af2c7f455ec9.52005003</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/right-service-deliverers-lets-really-get-down-to-co-designing/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LU MP2: Neighbourhood Centres Scoping Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F029916A-5975-4CA0-9BCC-47C13C0692BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the first steps in the Leapfrog Neighbourhood Centres project brought together Lancashire County Council professionals across libraries, Wellbeing, Prevention and Early Help Services, Asset Management, Facilities Management and the Public Service Integration Team.

The aim of the 3rd co-design session at Chorley Library was for the group to work in established groups to co-design tools to help each Neighbourhood Centre address challenges in their own way.

In the spirit of co-design, we produced a draft copy to take to show the young designers to get their input, which would include the name of the newspaper and features throughout. On Tuesday 19th January, facilitator Dee Hennessy joined Gemma and Laura at Child Action Northwest Headquarters to reveal the newspaper to the young designers and their social workers. Dee got everyone warmed up by asking partners to draw each other with only their left hand and choose a 'designer name', during which there were plenty of giggles! We revealed each spread of the newspaper one by one to the group, which caused great excitement from the young people and the social workers. Dee then asked for the group's feedback and suggestions for names of the newspaper, whilst Laura and Gemma recorded the young people talking about what they thought about each tool and the newspaper. Overall feedback was very positive with the young people saying they would show the tools to their social workers and that their confidence had grown as a result of attending the residential.

The young people and their youth workers reacted very positively to the newspaper and are interested in attending another event to receive the paper.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1bcd51d8d73.28529982</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/young-designers-become-young-newspaper-editors/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Discussion Around Tool Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0806E3A5-9BB6-4CBD-B619-3DF5111E564F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It was a discussion around tools and engagement with a group of researchers within the Institute of Design Innovation.

As part of the project, Mike Rawsterne and Ben Pearson both attended a creative session on Monday 21st November at Lancaster University. The focus of the session was to specifically see how Leapfrog could assist with the analysis of the data and come up with ideas for tools and techniques to enhance analysis so outcomes from the event are evidence based and impartial. One of the ways we approached this, was to ask Mike to map what he did before an event to prepare for the report, what he did during the event to prepare for the report and what he did after the event to prepare the report. The most significant insight here was that Mike wanted to gather data that could be fed into a narrative about the people who use health provision. This would cover where they have come from, how they arrived at where they are now and where they are going.

The need to record data that produces a narrative was recorded as one of the key aims of the analysis tool. The other aims included inclusivity, clarity for participants and facilitators, clarity that health affects people all the time and provides ownerships of decisions and representation of different people. Due to the lack of time, we acknowledged that some of these aims would be transferred to the next major Leapfrog research project, 'Rigorous Stories' rather than this short project, 'Healthy Stories'.

The plan for the activities to take place during the event had already been decided by the planning team for the event. The decision was to use Leapfrog's target control tool to help groups indicate how they felt about 36 health topics by placing them under three headings according to how important the services were to them. Both during and before the session, Leapfrog and Ben made suggestions for ways this activity could be improved, as well as additional activities to vary the data collected.

With the information we had, we came up with some ideas that could support the analysis of the data. These included the use of photographs in the report document, taking the information to other groups to see what they think, making it more accessible to the public, making it more visual. More specifically, we discussed a tool to make a one page infographic summary of data or an event, photographs of people holding up the data and a structure of prompts to build a narrative or case study.
The session was quick-paced and productive. It became clear to us that even though our focus was on supporting the analysis of the data, it would be difficult to decide how to analyse it without firm decisions on the form of the activities taking place. Also, if the aim was to use the data to communicate a narrative for the people who use health provision, the activities would have to be structured to collect rich data on narrative. 

Since this event, we have been informed that the Healthtalk event due to be held on the 26th November has been cancelled and we waiting to find out if it will be rescheduled and how this effects the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad6c8cb9bfa4.43251924</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/healthy-stories-creative-session/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young People's Co-Design Residential (LU MP1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A946A275-B2FA-429C-AA3C-97CB56C187B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The two-day Leapfrog young people's co-design residential took place at Lancaster University in November. 11 young people aged between 12 and 17 and their youth workers attended the residential. They were all recruited by Child Action Northwest and Blackburn with Darwen Council and were either in-care, young carers or on the edge of care and had lots to say about their experiences interacting with public services. We asked them to identify problems they wanted to fix and then we worked together to co-design tools to fix these problems. They young people came up with and agreed five tools altogether over the two days.

This was a challenging group to work with and it was hard to get them to focus but they did all focus and come up with creative ideas. The youth workers commented on how impressed they were with the hard work they put in as many of the group struggle to engage at school for longer than half an hour.

All of the young people said they would like to continue to be part of Leapfrog. Each member of the group said they had found out something new about themselves and many of the group said that it was engaging and that their confidence had grown as a result.

Leapfrog produced a newspaper, edited by the young people with the 5 tools inside it, accompanied with comments and tips from the young people themselves. This paper will be disseminated nationally. We held the tool sharing event with over 50 engagement professionals to share these tools.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c1bb843fba86.89906811</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/leapfrog-young-peoples-co-design-residential/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tools for Non-Written Consultation: Tools Demonstration (LU SP1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B5E9E1C-D761-48B3-AC34-1C8EC48B88AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Friday 7th February 2015 Leapfrog invited our public sector partners back to ImaginationLancaster for an interactive demonstration of the tools they had helped to create earlier in the week.

The new tools were also made available to anyone else who wished to download them on Leapfrog's web site. Several of the group went on to be involved in future Leapfrog projects that year.




Three Leapfrog tools for non-written consultation were realised as a result of this activity. These are reported under 'Artistic and Creative Products' and in brief are:

1) Interactive Journey
2) The Grid
3) Visual Voice

A report of the first short project 'Tools for non-written consultation' is uploaded in 'Publications'.

Finding effective and appropriate ways to encourage young people to attend consultation and stay engaged throughout the process was voted the most important and challenging, the translation of language both ways came second and understanding what consultation is and enabling young people to communicate what they want came joint third.

The four consultation experts worked with the Leapfrog team in a high tempo, slightly pressurised session, generating lots of ideas to tackle the prioritised themes. The ideas were laid out on a table together while everyone undertook a critique of the ideas. Members of the group were encouraged to highlight, amend and extend the ideas as they were discussed.

We discussed the possibility of working on a project that could bring expert knowledge from both teams to address some prevailing issues we face in evaluation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56a7a20f6a8479.14315028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/talking-evaluation-with-evaluation-support-scotland/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creative Processes for Engagement in a Museum Context (LU SP5)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>858245DF-9173-4174-A547-CCD5B9EC9014</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A collaboration with Sarah Campbell, Head of Learning Programs, The Victoria and Albert Museum, London. This workshop was the first in a series to collaborate with Sarah who has been awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Traveling Fellowship. Sarah will be travelling to the US in September 2016 to meet with learning staff in four museums and at one tour company. Teams in these organisations are particularly creative and their programmes are particularly innovative and Sarah wants to get a better understanding of HOW they do these things so well. The aim is that Leapfrog would co-design a set of tools that Sarah could apply during her travels. The first workshop developed 2 major research questions and 9 sub questions to explore over the course of 3 workshops. The team are meeting again to further finesse and refine our ideas and put the tools developed into action over the course of Sarah's travels. An important component of a Churchill Fellowship is that the learning is shared as broadly as possible and for the benefit of the sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c166719d99d9.17481089</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/creative-process-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tool sharing session with Amplify Champions at Healthwatch</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF80AE2E-F0D1-450A-90F8-8A19D426EB9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Leapfrog shared tools in a lively session with an engaged and exciting group of young champions from the Amplify Community Researchers Project, a part of Healthwatch Blackburn with Darwen (BwD). The session was organized by Ben Pearson from Healthwatch BwD for champions, aged between thirteen and seventeen years old, based at two schools including Darwen Vale High School. Champions are responsible for facilitating conversations with their peers about health and promote healthy practices. The group had some great ideas about how they were going to use the tools and quickly envisaged lots of ways they could use and adapt them to direct specific conversations. For instance, they could use Storyboard to talk about the experience of bullying and what happens afterwards, and how and where public health services can design appropriate interventions to help.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58986644895974.29694411</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/tool-sharing-session-with-amplify-champions-at-healthwatch/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>(LU SP2) Make It Stick: research interviews</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27E1524E-0FE5-4FA0-A3C1-5D740901C3D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Make It Stick project took one of our existing tools, Visual Voice, and sought to identify and develop how the design of image and text could be controlled and created entirely by the person using the tool.

To tackle this, Laura from Leapfrog and Ben Pearson from Healthwatch decided to add a layer of tracing paper over the target controls for comments to be written on top to capture the reasons why.

Our first aim is to help our collaborating partners engage more effectively and creatively with the people they represent, support or work with. Our second aim is to use these collaborations as a test-bed for the design of tools and resources to help engagement across the UK. We are actively collaborating with (beyond dissemination) Lancashire County Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Blackburn and Darwen Unitary Authority, The Scottish Government, Child Action Northwest, Mull and Iona Community Trust, Derbyshire County Council, Derbyshire Fires Service.

In this context there is a very strong potential for impact throughout the project. Our partners are changing the way they engage as a result of their collaboration with us and the tools we have co-designed together. We are also publishing tools in an ongoing process to be shared and adopted widely in the UK.

Two years into a 3 year project we have completed 4 sub-projects and have undertaken 76 engagement activities resulting in over 16 new tools that are freely available through our project website (www.leapfrog.tools). While the measure of the people of unique visits to the tools download section of this website (over 2,000) is only a general indicator of engagement for evaluation purposes we are currently tracking 200 individuals who have downloaded one or more of the tools. We also have documented evidence of individual tools being physically deployed and used over 700 times. We are in dialogue with these people and in addition to gathering baseline data before they use the tools we will be following the impact of the tools at 2 month, 6 month and 18month periods.

Anecdotally the collaboration with our public sector and NGO partners we have strong informal indicators of impact. Our on-going evaluation process is designed to resolve these into evidence based impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DEB6555C-3865-40F5-9641-22DFABFC9C10</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e168488c31b9.30387292</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Sharing tools for creative engagement with creative engagment practitioners at the University of the West of England</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34B0CD50-ECDE-478B-A124-A39631B46F0D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58986871954fb0.43328268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://leapfrog.tools/blog/sharing-tools-for-creative-engagement-at-uclan/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation Practitioners Event - Are We Listening?
