This follow on funded project aims to commercialise unresolved findings in the original AHRC practice led grant 'Woven Concrete' (AH/E006248/1) That lab based project aimed to create innovative concrete textile surfaces. The original findings of using linen as the most suitable base fabric to withstand the harsh alkaline properties of concrete will be brought to a conclusion with this collaboration with MYB textiles, Scotland. We will develop a range of woven linen lace concrete surfaces using knowledge gathered over the intervening years to generate large scale panels. Inspired by the initial grant Belford and Morrow continued their collaboration eventually developing patented products. Those developments were an extension of the thinking and learning from the original grant however they were carried out by different means, which ultimately proved to be time consuming and expensive to produce. These new methods of production with MYB will result in commercially viable and more sustainable methods of manufacturing a linen lace. Belford and Morrow in the intervening years have generated many world wide contacts, through promotion of the existing expensive technologies, also finding time to present and write about the process, reflecting on the cultural significance and tension of bringing two diverse cultures - concrete and textiles into one process. Marketing feedback has indicated that scale and a one stage process for making would place this product in a much stronger position. This has been unachievable due to limitations on current technology available.
This project application is therefore intended to: 
a) Return again to the original findings of the earlier grant and with the knowledge and experience developed in the intervening years by using large scale textile manufacturing techniques to make commercially viable lace textiles for infusing with concrete, hence opening up new commercial opportunities . MYB currently weave lace with cotton yarns and a diversification to linen will be a response to recent client interest in linen. 
b) Present the story of this collaboration in an imaginative way that engages the general public; specialist interest groups in traditional and innovative textiles; and the concrete industry. 
The lab based research of 'woven concrete' identified linen as suitable to withstand the alkaline conditions of concrete, in the original grant the textile pattern was created by a post devore (burn out) print process to create lace-like textiles, this however was laborious, costly and uncontrollable, so in order to try and commercialise the embedded textile processes the researchers later created the lace structures by laser cutting on pre woven imported textiles. This is currently one of the three patented processes that went forward for commercialisation. However this is costly, energy inefficient and time consuming and we have now identified a need to find an alternative method for creating lace linen. A feasibility study funded by Ulster University research confirmed MYB as the most suitable Company to collaborate with, they have the technology and a forward thinking outlook, but are not yet weaving in linen lace. MYB, is a 115 year old textile company based in Scotland and the only remaining UK industrial producer of woven lace. They currently only weave lace effects with cotton but are willing to collaborate and alter loom settings and yarn in order to take part in this project. They view this as a valuable addition to their existing portfolio. The final pieces of work (large panels) will be exhibited in both Scotland and Northern Ireland, attracting audiences from both Textiles and Architecture</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact generated from this project will, on the first level, be through knowledge exchange between; the applicants and the community around QUB concrete labs, and more specifically with MYB and their design team. The project will stimulate new processes, new skills and potentially new clients for MYB. MYB aim the generate new sales platforms through the development of a new linen woven fabric that is not only suitable for embedding in concrete, but also as a stand alone linen fabric that could be incorporated in the MYB range. In this project we are asking MYB to weave with linen, to date they only weave with cotton. This diversification to linen is less expensive, with improved sustainability, as weather does not factor so much in the price fluctuation, a recent observation when purchasing cotton yarns. The flax plant is hardier, and therefore not so vulnerable to climate changes. The robustness of linen is one of the characteristics of this fibre that deems it a suitable yarn the use within concrete. MYB has had recent requests from the Russian market for a linen product, one reason being they do produce a lot of linen yarn but MYB are the only design and weave source of damask lace weaving. MYB would like to be able to offer a new innovative product to their existing market plus opening doors to a wider customer base e.g. architectural clients and building contractors. Impact will also occur through dissemination to the concrete, textile and architecture disciplines and related industries. Support and evidence of Impact will come from existing networks with BRE (Building Research Establishment) and The Concrete Society who to date have actively supported the work and development of the researchers, and are always keen to report new developments through their extensive networks both locally and globally. The work of Belford and Morrow has been previously been cited across a range of publications (in textiles, innovation, interiors and concrete) and also trade magazines and on line blogs. This project in its entirety will be disseminated through pre-existing networks, using tweets, blogs and Instagram to engage the public and research communities encouraging feedback and comments. Due to the researchers diverse range of networks (across textiles, construction and architecture) a wide-ranging view point will be available. Interest will be stimulated from a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, who will not only be engaged in the Impact but the information gathered will be used to inform the researchers of further potential opportunities of development. The proposed activities outlined will take place in 5 stages, drawn up in consultation with MYB, each stage will generate its own Impact pathway, ranging from design development to concrete lab developments, these will be monitored and reported, informing the final stage of the project through dissemination of the work through different channels, commercial, industrial and academic. Both the PI and Co I have witnessed their collaborative work referenced in student portfolios across the UK, being referenced on Northern Irish A'Level Art and Design course work documentation, the work appeals to all levels of learning, we are particularly keen to influence the next generation.The final stage of the project will be two exhibitions; in Scotland and Northern Ireland, each supported by a public lecture to a range of communities from academic to commercial and textiles to concrete. The Impact generated from this project will be used not only as a powerful tool to promote the collaboration with MYB and academia, but to also bring new solutions to concrete and textile industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79515</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P008526/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA992CBF-8F56-4B55-AF51-A6876E825318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design &amp; Testing Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A6348FE-CF33-4F09-B4DA-BA731821F803</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Product Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
