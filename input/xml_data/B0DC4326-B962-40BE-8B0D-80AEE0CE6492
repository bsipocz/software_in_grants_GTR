Of particular interest is how bubbles collapse as a result of strong changes in pressure, which happens in sonochemistry applications, ultrasonic cleaning and is responsible for the cavitation damage in hydraulic systems. In the absence of any boundaries, an initially spherical bubble will remain spherical and collapse towards a single point. The same collapsing bubble near a plane wall, however, will result in a fast liquid jet shooting towards the wall. But what happens to such a bubble in more complex geometries, as appear in most applications, is currently unknown. This project aims to answer this fundamental question by investigating the controlled generation and collapse of bubbles in increasingly complex geometries.
There are three main subjects that will be investigated in this project. The first one is large cylindrical cavities that are analogues to two-dimensional cavitation bubbles. The large scale of these bubbles allows us to investigate the evolution of the shape and the flow field around the bubble in great detail. The second subject is laser-induced cavitation, where three-dimensional vapour bubbles are generated through a short focused laser pulse. Both techniques allow us to accurately control the position and size of the (two- or three-dimensional) cavitation bubble with respect to the surrounding geometry. The third part of the project is in collaboration with an ultrasonic cleaning company to investigate the influence of the observed phenomena on cleaning applications, with the aim to find routes to improve and optimize current ultrasonic cleaning techniques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although the main purpose of the proposed research is fundamental understanding of collapsing bubbles, there are many connections to applications. Through these connections, our research has on the longer term a potential for beneficial impact on the economy as well as society and the environment. The behaviour of bubbles and specifically their interaction with solid boundaries are in the heart of ultrasonic cleaning applications, sonochemistry, industrial cavitation damage and underwater noise. This project will investigate the basic principles of bubble-wall interactions that form the foundation for these applications, and thereby potentially enable further technological innovations. To make the connection from the proposed research to potential applicability there is a project partner BuBclean that specialises in innovations in ultrasonic cleaning.
A specific example in ultrasonic cleaning applications could be in fine-tuning parameters to achieve a specific level of cleaning. Ultrasonic cleaning is preferably done at the lowest power possible to save energy and avoid cavitation damage, while still having a short processing time and sufficient cleaning. Recent technological advancements make it possible to inject bubbles with a very specific size into a cleaning bath. Knowing exactly how each bubble behaves in the vicinity of surfaces would then allow us to predict how well these bubbles perform as cleaning agents, and how this can be improved by tuning the bubble size or the sound field. These steps will result in improved ultrasonic cleaning while reducing energy consumption and minimizing cavitation damage.
As bubble interactions with boundaries have a wide range of applications, there is an expected economic impact on the longer term resulting from a better fundamental understanding. These economic benefits can arise from increased efficiency of ultrasonic cleaning applications or competitive advantages from better quality of cleaning. Better control or techniques to prevent cavitation damage in hydraulic systems, on the other hand, will reduce reparation costs and prolong lifetime of equipment. 
One of the advantages of ultrasonic cleaning over other cleaning techniques is that it reduces the need for chemical cleaning agents. Improving the efficiency of ultrasonic cleaning would have a direct impact on the environment by reducing the amount of chemical waste. It also has an impact on society by increasing health and safety when the use of aggressive and potentially dangerous chemicals can be reduced. This is important for the emerging 3D-printing industry, where currently chemical cleaning is often recommended in combination with ultrasonic cleaning to remove support materials.
Finally, besides the applicability of research into bubbles, collapsing cavities can develop fascinating free surface shapes that are intriguing for a wide audience. Previous research from the PI on this field has featured in the art gallery of the University of Twente, and also has received the APS/DFD Milton van Dyke Award in the Gallery of Fluid Motion. This has been a successful way to engage the public in our research and to indirectly raise interest in fluid dynamics generally. Generating public awareness is one of EPSRC's objectives under its Royal Charter and will also be actively pursued in this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100545</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P012981/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
