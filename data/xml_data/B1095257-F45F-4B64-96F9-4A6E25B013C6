However, the primary focus of the KE Fellow will be to deliver economic impact. Economic impact will be delivered throughout the range of core KE activities. 
Relationship Management
Economic impact will be delivered through the consolidation of existing relationships and the development of new relationships. The fellow will develop new networks of NERC funded academics aimed mainly at the NERC-Business interaction. The aim being to move the relationships up the ?loyalty ladder?.

 

New ?prospects? would be new companies, individuals and organisations who may have potential use for NERC funded research or the networking of NERC funded individuals to form new collaborations. Economic impact would be generated through the generation of new research activity, collaborations, consultancies or KTP?s.

Initial analysis has identified existing relationships with companies and organisations; Groundwork Leicester (purchaser), Magna Parva (client), ESA and SSTL (supporters). We currently have ten prospect companies to be directly engaged in the first year. The fellow would aim to consolidate these relationships around NERC funded activities thus converting prospects to purchasers, purchasers to clients etc. As there is no equity holding in a University we do not anticipate that ?partners? will be formed.

Identification of technologies/datasets for re-use in other applications or sectors
The identification of new technologies, the development of early stage technologies and the re-use of technologies/datasets for new market sectors are fundamental objectives of this fellowship. As such we anticipate that economic impact will be delivered through the formation of new products, raising investment, wealth creation through adding value to technologies, the generation of new jobs, securing existing jobs and where appropriate generatcome or a new company.

An independent report by Price Waterhouse Cooper (2006) states that ?the availability of environmental information through Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) represents a significant opportunity to exploit and develop innovative new products, services and markets?. A study carried out for the EC estimated that the commercial potential in exploiting European public sector information (mainly environmental information) represents more than ?50 billion per year. According to the European Environment Agency, properly developed environmental policies stimulate innovation in environmental technologies and services and the global market for such products is already in the region of ?425 billion per annum (State of the Environment Report 2005)
Business Assistance
Positive economic impact can be generated through business assistance. The dissemination of research outputs through seminars, workshops and meetings to bring together researchers and end users assists businesses to improve performance. Other vehicles to deliver improved performance and skills development include consultancy, student placements, CPD courses and KTP?s. 
Timetable 
During the fellowship the following economic impact KPI?s will be monitored:
? Number of academics involved in KE activities
? Number of new collaborations
? Number of relationships consolidated
? Number of people assisted in skills development
? Number of new technologies/products identified
? Money levered against NERC funding
? Number of businesses assisted to improve performance
? Commercial investment secured
? Number of licenses or companies formed

Performance against these KPI?s will be reviewed at 6 monthly intervals over the three year period. We anticipate that the activities in year 1 will be preparatory and as such the main economic benefit will be delivered in years 2 and 3. It is acknowledged within the technology transfer arena thatvities may not be realised until 3-5 years after the initial KE activities were started. As such the economic impacts of this fellowship may occur after the end of the project and as such this will be monitored by the EBDO.
The anticipated economic impacts delivered by this fellowship over the 3 year period are outlined in the table below:

Identification of technologies/datasets for re-use in other applications or sectors
The identification of new technologies, the development of early stage technologies and the re-use of atasets for new market sectors are fundamental objectives of this fellowship. As such we anticipate that economic impact will be delivered through the formation of new products, raising investment, wealth creation through adding value to technologies, the generation of new jobs, securing existing jobs and where appropriate generating licence income or a new company.
