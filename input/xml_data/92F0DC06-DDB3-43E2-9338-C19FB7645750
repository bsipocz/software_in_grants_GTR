In homotopy theory, for instance, once can ask specifically, given two topological spaces, what is the set of all homotopy classes of maps between them. Similarly, in group theory the question becomes, given two groups G and H, what is the set of all homomorphisms, or representations between them. The theory of p-local finite groups sits squarely in the intersection between homotopy theory and group theory. It was introduced by Broto, Oliver and the PI in the early 2000's with the aim to create a unified framework in which the p-local homotopy theory of classifying spaces of finite group can be studied and generalised. They obtained a number of fundamental results, and created a field of study which attracted significant attention among mathematicians working both in group and representation theory, and in algebraic topology. In particular the setup of p-local groups enabled them to obtain an algebraic classification of the group of all homotopy classes of self homotopy equivalences of a classifying space of a p-local finite group. This, along with numerous other successes in the subject, raised the expectation that p-local group theory will become instrumental in understanding homotopy classes of more general maps between classifying spaces. To date however, all attempts to reach this goal have failed. 

A p-local finite group consists of three bits of data, a finite p-group S, and two categories, F and L. The category F called a saturated fusion system over S, has subgroups of S as its objects and homomorphisms between them as morphisms, such that certain axioms are satisfied. Such categories arise naturally in group theory and modular representation theory. The category L, called a centric linking systems associated to F, is in a precise sense an enrichment of F which allows one to associate a topologically meaningful classifying space with F. Broto, Oliver and the PI developed an obstruction theory to the existence and uniqueness of a centric linking system associated to a given fusion system F, but were not able to show that such linking systems do exist, and indeed are unique if they do. Chermak (the VR) recently introduced a further abstraction of the concept of a linking system which he named partial groups, or more specifically localities. A careful study of these objects allowed him to deliver a spectacular positive solution to the existence/uniqueness problem.

Partial groups, unlike linking systems, come equipped with a very natural concept of morphisms between them. The further refinement - localities - on the other hand still do not possess a good concept of morphisms between them, but there are several natural ideas which deserve serious consideration. It is the close relationship between localities and p-local finite groups which suggest that revisiting the theory from this perspective may give information about mapping spaces between classifying spaces of p-local groups. This project is aimed at a careful study of localities, morphisms between them, and the interaction with linking systems/p-local groups, in order to gain insight into the question of how to classify maps or homotopy classes of maps between their classifying spaces.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The theory of p-local finite (and later, compact) groups was developed by Broto, Oliver and the PI with the aim to study the homotopy theory of p-completed classifying spaces of finite and compact Lie groups. One of the main result they obtained was a full classification in algebraic terms of the group of homotopy classes of homotopy equivalences of a p-completed classifying space, or more generally the classifying space of a p-local group. It was predicted since the creation of the subject that these techniques will afford us a better understanding of more general mapping spaces between classifying spaces of p-local groups. This is considered to be one of the most important and hardest problem in the homotopy theory of groups. Several attempts in this direction all reached a dead end. With the introduction of partial groups into the subject by the VR and the success he had in resolving another very difficult problem using his newly created techniques, hope is now high that partial groups will pave the way to understanding of mapping spaces. If successful, even in part, then the interaction which already exists between group and representation theory, as it expresses itself in the study of fusion systems and classifying spaces will become even deeper and more involved. Since the theory of fusion systems is deeply embedded in modular representation theory, it is very likely that a successful description of morphisms between localities will also have a significant impact there.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My article joint with A.

At present Libman and I continue collaboration on maps between classifying spaces. We have made some progress in this direction, but it is still premature to report on results. In addition communication with Chermak on the use of Partial Groups technology in the study of maps between classifying spaces continues. Justin Lynd will be joining our research group next year and collaboration on this subject may grow.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The existence and uniqueness question was fundamental in the subject. Basically, this means that the linking system and hence the homotopy type associated to a fusion system exists and is unique up to equivalence. This theorem simplifies and made many existing questions easier, and so it is expected to have a long lasting impact in the subject.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4840E0DF-CD00-46F2-ACD5-EFB8451A4324</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2791900292.7764327798b1f8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B9F9B596-CCB1-46DB-BA63-59453149E0C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Existence and uniqueness of classifying spaces for fusion systems over discrete
