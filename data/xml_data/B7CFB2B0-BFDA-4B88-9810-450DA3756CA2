It involves removal of the cancer together with any cancer cells that have spread along draining channels (lymphatics). This strategy of radical surgery minimises the risk of the cancer recurring, but subjects all patients to high-risk surgery; one-third of patients will suffer a complication with one-in-twenty patients dying as a result. In addition, only 30% of patients will truly benefit from radical surgery, as the remaining 70% will not have spread beyond the cancer meaning that removal of the draining lymphatics is unnecessary - they would have been cured by simple removal of the cancer alone. 
The pattern of colorectal cancer is changing. An aging population means that more elderly patients are suffering from colorectal cancer and are less able to tolerate major surgery. In addition, the introduction of National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) has resulted in many more cancers being diagnosed at an earlier stage without spread to the lymphatics. The current strategy of removing all cancers along with the draining lymphatics therefore has to change. A strategy is needed whereby the extent of surgery is tailored to the spread of the cancer and the fitness of the patient.
Central to such a strategy is the ability to distinguish those patients that have cancer spread to lymphatics, who will benefit from radical surgery, from those without spread to the lymphatics, who will be adequately treated by a much less extensive operation to remove the cancer alone. Unfortunately, current imaging methods are only 50% accurate in determining cancer spread to the lymphatics - no better than tossing a coin.
This research proposal presents a solution to this clinical problem. A small particle (nanoparticle) will be developed that can be injected into patients and will specifically concentrate in cancer due to the incorporation of a targeting molecule (anti-CEA adhiron) on the particles surface. The nanoparticle will contain a fluorescent molecule (photosensitiser) allowing it to be easily detected at laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery, where a light is shone into the abdomen. It will also contain a molecule (gadolinium) that allows the particles to be visualised by special radiological imaging methods (MRI scan). For the first time, this will allow cancer images taken before surgery (MRI scan) to be matched to the images obtained at the time of surgery (laparoscopic fluorescence). This will enhance the surgeon's ability to be sure of the location and spread of the cancer. The cancer surgery can then be tailored appropriately so that only patients with evidence of cancer spread to the lymphatics are subjected to high-risk, extensive surgery. In addition, the fluorescent molecule in the nanoparticle will be chosen so that it has cancer-killing properties when it is activated by light, adding another important anti-cancer feature.
This research project will develop the above nanoparticle and test its usefulness in the laboratory using colorectal cancer cells and a small animal model of colorectal cancer. If it is successful, it will lead to further pre-clinical studies to determine how best to bring the nanoparticle into clinic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Curative surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) involves radical surgery to remove the primary cancer along with the regional draining lymphatics to minimise the risk of locoregional recurrence. Only 30% of patients have lymph node disease, meaning that 70% of patients undergo unnecessarily radical surgery. There is a clinical need to distinguish patients with and without lymph node disease, but current imaging modalities lack sensitivity, with CT scan having only 50% accuracy. An aging population means that more elderly patients are developing CRC and are less able to tolerate radical surgery. In addition, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) is resulting in a shift to earlier stage disease. A proposed solution is to develop a multifunctional nanoparticle that will allow accurate intraoperative cancer staging and surgery tailored to the individual patient. 
Aims: To develop a multifunctional silica NP, targeted to CRC and incorporating an MR contrast agent and photosensitiser, for accurate intraoperative staging to facilitate stratified CRC surgery. 
Methods: We have previously identified carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as the preferred biomarker for CRC and conjugated an anti-CEA antibody to a fluorescent silica nanoparticle (Si-NP). Testing of the functionalised Si-NP in vitro and in a small animal model has shown it to be specific and sensitive for CRC. We will build on the Si-NP platform, incorporating a photosensitiser (PS) and MRI contrast agent (Gadolinium, Gd) for added functionality. The anti-CEA antibody will be replaced with an anti-CEA adhiron to enhance sensitivity and specificity and to enable mass production of the targeting element. The multifunctional nanoparticle will be tested in vitro and in a small animal model of CRC for sensitivity, specificity, and phototherapeutic efficacy. 
Novelty: This will be the first time a theranostic NP, combining a PS with a paramagnetic agent, has been developed against CRC.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will result in the fabrication of a multi-functional nanoparticle to enhance intraoperative CRC staging and facilitate stratified cancer surgery. It has potential to impact on:

1. Patients
 -More patients, including more elderly patients, will benefit from surgery tailored to the stage of their cancer.
 -Reduced morbidity from more targeted and less invasive cancer surgery.
 -Quicker recovery from surgery with less functional deficit and better preservation of physical independence.
 -Improved oncological outcomes resulting from more accurate disease staging.

2 Clinicians
 -Provide a means of more effectively treating colorectal cancer, with particular benefit in the elderly and frail.

3. Healthcare Providers
 -More targeted surgery will result in less morbidity, particularly in the elderly, and less mortality. This will produce cost-savings from a reduced need to undertake expensive remedial interventions.

4. Society
 -Re-align the treatment of CRC with the changing needs of the population in terms of increasing age and shift to earlier stage disease.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207859</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Toronto</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration between the nanotechnology group at the University of Leeds and University of Toronto in Canada.</gtr:description><gtr:id>96702FD5-495C-4677-B4E9-D362F90ED8FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None so far</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c12b7eb167.61902009-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our contribution is to functionalise the PLP particles with synthetic binding proteins targeted against colorectal cancer.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have established a strategic collaboration with one of the best nanogroup units in Canada where we have explored strategies to improve clinical applications of cancer imaging, diagnosis and therapy using nanotechnology.
