In late antiquity, from the end of the fourth century onwards, Christian authors wrote encyclopaedias of heresies and deviant beliefs, creating a genre of literature that has come to be known as heresiology. What is striking about these texts is that, rather than merely basing their arguments for a particular theological viewpoint on biblical exegesis or Christian tradition, they also employed techniques from classical technical writing to present themselves as definitive guides to orthodoxy, communicating reliable information that had been collected and organised in the same manner as in a natural history or a guide to anatomy. Like an encyclopaedist or physician, the heresiologist became a new type of scholarly expert, while heresiology was constructed as another branch of scientific knowledge to be studied, classified and defined. Moreover, even though imperial support by the emperor Constantine and his successors had freed Christianity from the danger of pagan persecution, it had also revealed, and even exacerbated, disagreements and divisions among believers. While heresiologies have often been dismissed as haphazard and distasteful agglomerations of attacks on the Church's enemies, this project will both rehabilitate them as sophisticated examples of technical literature and also place them firmly back into a context of theological and institutional instability, interpreting them as attempts by authors to secure their own orthodox status against dangerous challenges from opponents.

My most recent completed project, which produced a monograph for Cambridge University Press in 2013, explored the role of invective in the political life of the fourth-century Roman empire, including its renegotiation in response to the novelty of having a Christian emperor whom some of his co-religionists regarded as misguided or even heretical. During the course of the fellowship, I will be writing a monograph on the development of heresiology - and the persona of the heresiologist - during late antiquity, illuminating its repeated reinvention in response to both changing cultural and political circumstances and also the growing literary tradition of the genre. In addition, I will organise an international conference on the theme of cultural interactions and identity in late antiquity, and also edit a volume of papers resulting from it. I will also be visiting Germany and North America to disseminate my own research and engage with other academics working in both Classics and related fields, as well as bringing my own research - and that of other innovative scholars working on similar themes - to a wider audience through a series of podcast interviews, entitled 'New Adventures in Antiquity'.

By viewing the emergence of heresiology not as a dramatic, Christian-inspired break with the Greco-Roman past, but rather as a direct development from it, my work will illuminate a vital aspect of the re-use and transformation of classical literary conventions and methodologies for new contexts. In doing so, it will explore shifting attitudes towards the creation of authoritative knowledge during this period and, through comparison with epitomes, chronicles and other encyclopaedic writings, will contribute to the wider intellectual history of late antiquity. Moreover, by examining the variety of strategies employed both for the invention and redefinition of tradition and for the demarcation and policing of boundaries of acceptable behaviour and belief, it will, more broadly, provide a significant insight into the complex and often paradoxical ways in which science and religion can interlock, even - and perhaps especially - at times of rapid social and historical change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the problems of the early twenty-first century may seem far removed from those faced by people living almost two millennia earlier, this project will explore two questions from late antiquity that remain causes for concern in the present day: firstly, how are the identities of communities and groups to be defined, using a variety of mechanisms of unification and inclusion, of labelling and exclusion; and, secondly, how is the relationship between the concepts of 'science' and 'religion' to be understood, especially since these methods for making sense of the universe, and man's place within it, might appear to be mutually contradictory and fundamentally irreconcilable? By looking at late-antique heresiologies - catalogues of heresies that were structured as encyclopaedias or scientific handbook - my research offers an insight into potentially surprising answers to these questions, inviting people today to see how Christian Romans in late antiquity sought to mould their sense of a religious identity negatively, defining what they were by reference to what they were not. In pursuit of this end, they produced texts that presented the intricacies of theological speculation as a stable branch of knowledge to be studied, classified and disseminated in the same manner as any other field of scientific enquiry, such as anatomy or zoology. What many people in the modern world would see as matters of subjective faith were imbued with the status of objective fact.

By raising these questions and illuminating some late-antique answers to them, my research will be of interest to the general public at large, many of whom find themselves dealing with similar issues today. However, this project also seeks to alter the ways in which the classical period is perceived within society by drawing attention not merely to the similarities between the ancient and modern worlds (such as in concerns about community identities), but also to some of the surprising differences in beliefs about topics such as religion, ethnicity and sexuality. While some of the questions being asked by Romans seem very like those causing anxiety today, the answers were often radically different, with ancient attitudes often being difficult to comprehend for modern audiences. 

As the 'Pathways to Impact' document describes in greater detail, these issues will be brought to the attention of the wider public through a series of podcasts entitled 'New Adventures in Antiquity'. These talks, which will include interviews with scholars working on a variety of facets of identity in the ancient world, will have a light tone and will be aimed at a general audience, making potentially dry and difficult concepts more accessible and entertaining. In particular, it is hoped that they will appeal to people who are considering studying the classical world at university, especially if they have not previously had a chance to do so as part of their school curriculum. The success of the television series 'QI' demonstrates the popular appeal of a programme that informs the audience about a variety of different subjects by debunking widely-held misconceptions. These podcasts will perform a similar function by arguing that, in order to comprehend the classical world in all its fascinating complexity, it is vital to stop seeing it as 'the present day in funny clothes'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog for History Matters (Sheffield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34DA5C14-8C97-4271-B02E-52B8E94E2F99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I wrote a piece for the 'History Matters' blog run by the University of Sheffield.

This can be linked, in part, to the growth of Christianity, and of the Christian Church as an institution, in the decades after the emperor Constantine gave it his imperial support; I have, however, been examining it from a different angle to see how it built on techniques of creating, organising and classifying knowledge that had a much longer history in the ancient world. In reconstructing this context, my main focus has been on medical and encyclopaedic literature from classical Greece and Rome, exploring the methods by which authors of these texts constructed a sense both of their own scholarly fields and their places within them as authoritative experts.

This has involved looking at a range of different classical writers on a variety of topics, including Aristotle on zoology, Varro and Columella on agriculture, Vitruvius on architecture, Celsus and Galen on medicine, Pliny the Elder on natural history and Artemidorus on the interpretation of dreams. I have then been comparing their approaches and techniques to those employed by a number of heresiological authors from late antiquity, most notably Epiphanius of Salamis, Filastrius of Brescia, Augustine of Hippo and the anonymous figure responsible for a text known as the 'Praedestinatus'. My research has shown a significant degree of continuity - and even development - of these earlier literary methods for presenting oneself as a recognised authority within a stable and ordered branch of knowledge. Despite the fact that the heresiologists' subject area of interest was religious beliefs (which might, at first glance, seem unsuitable for being studied in the same manner as anatomy or botany), they used the established forms and rhetoric of scientific literature to present their own field as a topic of scholarly research, thereby reinforcing their own view of who deserved to be classified as orthodox or heretical. By examining the development of heresiology over time, I have also discovered how it began to be recognised as a distinctive form of technical literature, with its own conventions and leading exponents, enabling later authors to engage competitively with this legacy for their own aggrandisement. My work thus forms part of a recent rehabilitation of heresiology as a subject of serious study, seen most notably in the scholarship of Andrew Jacobs, Todd Berzon and Young Kim.

Alongside the major work on heresiology, this project will also be producing an edited volume entitled 'Rhetoric and Religious Identity in Late Antiquity', resulting from a conference held in 2015. This will continue with the exploration of how individuals defined their own sense of the acceptable boundaries of a religious identity for themselves, their allies and their enemies. Late antiquity was a time of rapid and sometimes violent changes in the relationships between religious groups, including both Christians and 'pagans' and also between different strands of Christianity. By understanding better the ways in which these events were caused, presented and managed, we might also offer insights for contemporary circumstances.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The topic of heresiology and the wider concept of religious identity in late antiquity are both areas in which there is a growing degree of scholarly interest, especially since I started this project. My academic publications on these issues will therefore help to advance the discussion of the degree of continuity with the pre-Christian Roman world, particularly since I have approached these texts primarily from the perspective of a classicist and ancient historian, rather than a theologian or a historian of religion. My work in this area has led to me being invited to edit 'The Cambridge Companion to Christian Heresy', for which I will also write a chapter on heresiology. This will allow me to bring my ideas to a wider audience and potentially to see them appear much more prominently in undergraduate curricula.

Despite the funding for this project having come to an end, I am continuing with my series of podcasts, entitled 'The Distant Pasts', which explore aspects of the ancient world that are less similar to the modern day than they might initially appear. I will therefore be able to examine additional features of classical antiquity in this way and to help to change public perceptions of the ancient Greeks and Romans. These impact activities have already led to me being asked to write blog posts and conduct media interviews, and I hope to build on this in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0BD5D3A-E0F5-40F6-AE34-35FD4A78965D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b204fa257d71.20725307</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82A1691C-5F55-430C-9B97-E31F35418490</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reviewing The Last Pagans of Rome</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Histos</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4adefd51c02dab8bc0632eff5e4b3c64"><gtr:id>4adefd51c02dab8bc0632eff5e4b3c64</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flower, R A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cafbc23b71d7.10838841</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F871664E-CC03-4EBD-9810-16A028DBC51C</gtr:id><gtr:title>New Approaches to the Later Roman Empire</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d912eed00ec005a37f43c2fe5aad8fb8"><gtr:id>d912eed00ec005a37f43c2fe5aad8fb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Flower, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9784990192921</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b52ff9e64586.77264375</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5C18C715-8C20-4B36-83F6-8D8D0BC458B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>L.
