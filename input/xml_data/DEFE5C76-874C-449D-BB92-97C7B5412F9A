[Sources: NACE Cost of Corrosion study (2002), IOM3 Corrosion Committee (2013)] Adding the indirect costs, the figure is somewhat higher than this, likely in the region of 5-6%. 
In addition to the economic costs, there are significant environmental and other costs associated with the corrosion problem. For example, systems processing drinking water can become contaminated by corrosion products; tankers, waste facilities and pipelines containing potentially hazardous materials can be susceptible to corrosion, too - and failure of such systems has clear risks for public and environmental safety. 
Biofouling, or biological fouling, is an accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae, or animals on wetted structures, and is, particularly in marine engineering, an undesirable phenomenon.
For example, the accumulation of biofouling on ships' hulls and propellers can significantly increase drag, and thereby increase fuel consumption and, consequently, CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, it occurs in almost all circumstances involving the contact of water based liquids with other materials. In marine environments, for example, formation of a biofilm by microorganisms, in the first instance, then enables successively larger macroorganisms to attach to the surface, eventually resulting in large organisms, such as mussels, sea squirts and barnacles, attaching.
Anti-fouling is the process of removing such deposits, or preventative measures to avoid the accumulation in the first instance. Typically, such action can include the use of antifouling coatings, which may contain biocides, or other methods of preventing organisms from attaching to surfaces, e.g. biomimetic coatings.
Many anti-fouling agents used in the past, such as tributyltin (TBT), have become unsuitable and, in some cases, banned chemicals due to environmental and toxicity concerns.
Given the scale and nature of fouling as an issue in marine engineering, and the economic and performance problems caused by fouling, a good deal of research activity continues to focus on this area.

The main focus of this research proposal is to carry out a proof-of-concept study into the use of doped, multi-layered, durable amorphous DLC, in the simultaneous prevention of corrosion and biofouling.
Such coatings continue to be developed for other applications; this project is derived from research undertaken at UWS into DLC coatings for interferometric gravitational wave detectors and durable protective anti-reflection coatings for infrared optical systems. Our group is currently evaluating DLC and modified DLC in combination with other surface treatments for improvements in the strength and durability of silicon, silica and sapphire suspension elements as used in the French-Italian Virgo detector, the American LIGO detectors, and the Japanese KAGRA detector currently under construction. 
Furthermore, we have recently provided a range of modified DLC coatings for evaluation by the Virgo group for use in detector baffle tubes.
Additionally and separately, previous work by the PI applicant focused on prevention of corrosion of naval alloys by deposition of multilayer DLC-based coatings; during environmental testing it was noted that certain film compositions exhibited an antifouling effect. One design in particular, containing a mix of dopant materials in the interlayers, exhibited a similar resistance to fouling as uncoated naval nickel aluminium bronze, which prevents fouling by release of copper ions as it corrodes; the oligodynamic effect. 
Our research will therefore be targeted towards development and testing of such coatings for tubular, planar and complex-shaped substrates, and assessing their suitability for use in protective applications, as well as scalability and potential of future commercialisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several beneficiaries of our proposed research, including industry, other academic groups and the general public. 
If the concept of using modified DLC multilayer coatings to simultaneously inhibit fouling and corrosion of steels is proven, we already have an industrial partner (Torishima Service Solutions Europe, a Glasgow, UK-based and registered subsidiary of Torishima Pump Manufacturing Company) with whom we can work to develop and commercialise the technology / product. The company has committed to providing in-kind benefits to an equivalent value of &amp;pound;10k over the period of this project, including marketing development support and provision for materials testing. 
If the current proposal proves to be successful, we would seek further joint research funding between UWS and Torishima, via an STFC IPS grant or a KTP arrangement, to bring the technology to market. 
Torishima is heavily involved in enhancing and extending the lifespan of industrial equipment and components, such as drilling equipment and pumps via coating application and equipment reconditioning, particularly within the oil and gas industry, but also within e.g. the food processing and water supply sectors. The oil and gas industry, in particular, is faced with many corrosion, erosion and equipment life extension issues, given that much of the equipment utilised here operates in very harsh, often corrosive and abrasive environments.
This particular project offers Torishima the opportunity to make substantial inroads into the oil and gas sector in particular, gaining benefits of being first to market with a promising new technology offering potentially increased operating life of alloy components, e.g. pipeline installations through inhibition of corrosion and fouling and improved mechanical properties via the application of doped multilayer DLC coatings.
The project will transfer a new technology from UWS to Torishima Service Solutions Europe - delivering new knowledge, skills and capabiities to a UK company. 
We have also, in the past, worked with Sub-One Technology, a US-based producer of vacuum deposition technology and provider of protective coatings; including, but not limited to, diamond-like carbon-based coatings. Our DLC research utilises a Sub-One HC-PECVD system for coating deposition. This company may have interest in licensing novel processes resulting from this research project. 
As mentioned in the previous sections, there are also academic beneficiaries of this proposal, both within and beyond UWS - for example, those groups conducting coating research within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, and those researching prevention and mitigation of healthcare associated infections within the microbiology subject area.
Finally, successful development of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings will, when such coatings are commercialised, have positive impact upon industry and the general public, through improved efficiency and operating life of mechanical components; particularly those exposed to harsh marine environments, such as seawater-bearing heat exchanger pipes as used in power generation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45209</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scottish Healthcare Associated Infection Prevention Institute (SHAIPI) event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>142931C1-0A30-4A2E-942C-3D9328FB9BCB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>SHAIPI future collaboration and capacity building day, held at Govan Mbeki Building, Glasgow Caledonian University on Friday 10 March 2017.

The objectives of the event were to increase capability, to widen future research capacity, and to stimulate and progress research ideas relating to healthcare associated infections (HAIs). This event focused primarily on PhD students; promoting the work of SHAIPI and allowing PhD students in Scotland - both within and outwith SHAIPI - to give a '3-minute thesis' presentation on their work. This also required students to present posters on their work, and provided the opportunity for academics and students to network, and identify potential future collaborations.
Shaun Robertson presented a poster and talk covering the development and evaluation of DLC and doped DLC coatings for steel substrates, with an emphasis on mitigation of biofilm formation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c92c28b49e59.75512704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/iii/research/researchcentres/sirn/shaipi/shaipiarchive/shaipievent10032017/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings, to our knowledge, have not thus far been utilised elsewhere. However, having recently published some of our findings, demonstrating potential biocidal effect of Ge-doped DLC for the first time, we would anticipate some interest in this technology. 
The industrial partner for the award, Torishima Service Solutions Europe, are very keen to move forward and to develop our collaboration further; they have proposed to purchase a salt spray chamber for the assessment of corrosion resistance of experimental samples generated. Further, they are open to collaboration on further funding applications (e.g. IPS and/or Innovate UK schemes) based upon this research and to provide guidance on marketing and strategy as and when the technology becomes sufficiently mature.
A second UK coating manufacturer, Chemco, held discussions with our research group at the inception of this project, and have asked to be kept informed of developments as they foresee some potential commercial applications of the technology.
During presentation of the research at the SVC TechCon conference in the United States in April 2016, a further two companies expressed interest.
Firstly, Dr Yuping Lin, Senior Scientist, Coca-Cola Global R&amp;amp;D department, expressed strong interest in our research, having attended the presentation; with particular regard to the demonstrated anti-microbial properties of DLC and, especially, doped DLC coatings. It is envisaged that these properties could be of benefit in terms of coating metallic components used in the food and drink industry. 
Secondly, Dr Zhonghuai Wang, a senior process engineer with Tanury Industries of Lincoln, Rhode Island, USA, also expressed interest in holding further discussions about modified DLC coatings for protective and decorative applications. Tanury Industries currently offers electroplated and PVD-deposited coatings for a range of metal finishing applications; notably in aerospace, architectural and electronics, but covering a rather large range of industry sectors.

At the present time, it isn't possible to move forward with these particular commercial interests, since we are not currently able to conduct any further coating deposition with the HC-PECVD system, until or unless the system is repaired or reinstated. 

The research to date in DLC coatings at UWS has focused on the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), which does somewhat restrict the classes of amorphous carbon that can be deposited; only hydrogenated amorphous carbons can be produced by this method. For some applications, e.g. medical applications, it is generally believed that hydrogen-free coatings are preferable in terms of biocompatibility. 
Work is underway under a separate STFC Consolidated grant, Investigations in Gravitational Radiation (ST/L000938/1) to (amongst other things) develop ion beam sputtering (IBS/IBD) technology for application to gravitational wave detector mirror coatings. Although not developed specifically for such, the unique system developed at UWS under this grant will be used to extend our research into DLC and doped DLC coatings (as well as other materials). This, however, will require many more months of process development. Within approximately one year, it is hoped that we will have built a scaled-up version of our IBD system for gravitational wave research, which will free up the small-scale system for use in researching other materials, including DLC and modified DLC.
This system will not supplant PECVD processes, but will be complementary and allow a greater range of amorphous carbon and doped DLC coatings to be produced; hydrogen-free coatings can be produced by IBD. While IBD is a much slower deposition process than the PECVD process developed under this grant, it is also possible that DLC with very high sp3 content may be produced in this manner; this may offer a larger range of applications in which these coatings will find utility.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2C0B6647-CF85-4246-B2B5-9425D7E331D0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb1a54ebbe4.17707359</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>It has been demonstrated that suitably-formulated amorphous carbon coatings (in some cases containing a quantity of dopant) can, to some extent, mitigate the formation of Gram-negative biofilms on steels (and other metallic substrates) while affording excellent corrosion resistance in harsh chemical environments. Furthermore, such coatings are extremely hard, smooth and conformal to the substrate and possess low coefficient of friction; these qualities also offer very good resistance to abrasion.
It is also possible to apply such coatings to interior and/or cylindrical substrates; this could have clear benefits in preventing fouling and corrosion in, for example, water-bearing pipe systems. 
Modified diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings were deposited onto 25 mm diameter 316 stainless steel discs by pulsed (direct current) hollow cathode plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (HC-PECVD). Multilayer films of total thickness 1-2 ?m were deposited, both with and without germanium dopant. Characterisation of the coatings was performed by SEM/EDX, surface energy/contact angle analysis, and assessment of possible biofilm-inhibiting properties. Both modified DLC and germanium-doped DLC (Ge-DLC) coatings showed a significant anti-biofouling effect on P. aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium. A 90% reduction in P. aeruginosa biomass was observed compared to control for both DLC and Ge-DLC, however this effect could not be attributed to germanium incorporation alone. Neither modified DLC nor Ge-DLC showed a significant inhibitory effect on S. aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium. Scanning electron microscopy of P. aeruginosa biofilms on Ge-DLC coated 316 stainless steel clearly displayed disruption of the cellular wall, as well as leakage of cellular components; this effect was not observed with the modified DLC coating. This suggests that germanium-doped DLC coatings may potentially exhibit a cidal mode of action versus P. aeruginosa biofilms - this is to our knowledge, the first demonstration of potential biocidal activity of germanium-doped DLC coatings. 
Interestingly, we have also recently shown that DLC coatings can improve the robustness of silicon suspension components for gravitational wave detectors (UWS being a full member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which recently announced the detection of gravitational waves for the first time) and increase the breaking strength of these by up to a factor of 2. A parallel program of research is currently continuing into the effect of these types of coatings, various plasma and mechanical surface treatments and other, non-DLC coatings (e.g. magnetron sputtered silica) on such components. The data gathered in this ongoing research is currently being analysed and a paper being prepared for publication.

A related application of DLC-type coatings also recently investigated is the coating of baffle tubes used in the vacuum systems of GW detectors. Since these are generally made of stainless steel, a range of modified, multi-layered DLC coatings were developed on steel substrates, with a view to providing protective and high-emissive properties. The results have proven to be favourable for this application; a technical report is available from the EGO repository (Bavigadda V et al., &amp;quot;Characterization of Diamond Like Carbon coating on polished stainless steel plate from University of West of Scotland&amp;quot;, Virgo Technical Note VIR-0009A-16, https://tds.ego-gw.it/ql/?c=11308 (2015).

Modifications of these coating designs will also find applications in prevention of corrosion and fouling. We have shown that 9&amp;micro;m-thick mixed dopant (Si/Ge) DLC multilayer-coated samples of nickel aluminium bronze (NAB) immersed in quiet flowing seawater retard the growth of biofoulant material over an immersion period of 100 days when compared to uncoated alloy; coating integrity remains excellent, showing that this coating provides protection from both biofouling and from marine corrosion. When compared to a similar, 'standard' coating containing only silicon dopant, the difference is marked - the key point here is that a quantity of incorporated germanium (and possibly silicon) is essential to the prevention of biofouling with such coatings.
Further study of these coatings for this application will, therefore, focus on similar, mixed-dopant designs.
In terms of corrosion resistance, we have shown that corrosion current for cupronickel, as measured by linear polarisation experiment, can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude by the application of a 6-layer, 5&amp;micro;m modified DLC coating, greatly retarding corrosion rate whilst offering enhanced mechanical durability.

It is anticipated that more detailed and extensive key findings will become available in future (please see details on why original objectives have not yet been fully met).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Such coatings have multiple applications, and may be of interest in preventing bacterial biofilm formation in medical settings (such as prevention of hospital-acquired infections), extending the life of mechanical components (such as pumps) in harsh physical or chemical environments, improving biofouling resistance of marine structures and preventing corrosion of metals. 
These may also offer an environmentally friendly alternative to often undesirable antifouling chemicals, for example those used in marine paints.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B7BAAB1C-6B10-4B0C-9542-143494093C01</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0500a32c017.95801712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897216311410</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A01DDFDE-B329-40CD-8824-D1BCF613BAE8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigation of the antimicrobial properties of modified multilayer diamond-like carbon coatings on 316 stainless steel</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Surface and Coatings Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2dc1bf1ccfda8b9dbc28087a16403c0d"><gtr:id>2dc1bf1ccfda8b9dbc28087a16403c0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robertson S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d433f326c32.81234115</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M00726X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A50650F5-D901-49C3-AA30-F625AC696676</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle Astrophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E0D6615C-86EB-4FB1-9874-BFED2EE238B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrochemical Science &amp; Eng.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4375685C-F12B-449B-BC75-C6052FD877DC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gravitational Waves</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C89BB7D-DCEF-4DCF-84DB-CA53C907AB0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Surfaces &amp; Interfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
