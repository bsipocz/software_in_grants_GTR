All the REE were defined as critical by the European Union in 2010, and in subsequent analysis in 2014. Similar projects in the UK and USA have highlighted 'heavy' REE (HREE - europium through to lutetium) as the metals most likely to be at risk of supply disruption and in short supply in the near future. The REE are ubiquitous within modern technologies, including computers and low energy lighting, energy storage devices, large wind turbines and smart materials, making their supply vital to UK society. The challenge is to develop new environmentally friendly and economically viable, neodymium (Nd) and HREE deposits so that use of REE in new and green technologies can continue to expand.
The principal aims of this project are to understand the mobility and concentration of Nd and HREE in natural systems and to investigate new processes that will lower the environmental impact of REE extraction and recovery.
By concentrating on the critical REE, the research will be wide ranging in the deposits and processing techniques considered. It gives NERC and the UK a world-leading research consortium on critical REE, concentrating on deposit types identified in the catalyst phase as most likely to have low environmental impact, and on research that bridges the two goals of the SoS programme.
The project brings together two groups from the preceding catalyst projects (GEM-CRE, MM-FREE) to form a new interdisciplinary team, including the UK's leading experts in REE geology and metallurgy, together with materials science, high/low temperature fluid geochemistry, computational simulation/mineral physics, geomicrobiology and bioprocessing. The team brings substantial background IP and the key skills required. The research responds to the needs of industry partners and involves substantive international collaboration as well as a wider international and UK network across the REE value chain. 
The work programme has two strands. The first centres on conventional deposits, which comprise all of the REE mines outside China and the majority of active exploration and development projects. The aim is to make a step change in the understanding of the mobility of REE in these natural deposits via mineralogical analysis, experiments and computational simulation. Then, based on this research, the aim is to optimise the most relevant extraction methods. The second strand looks to the future to develop a sustainable new method of REE extraction. The focus will be the ion adsorption deposits, which could be exploited with the lowest environmental impact of any of the main ore types using a well-controlled in-situ leaching operation.

Impact will be immediate through our industry partners engaged in REE exploration and development projects, who will gain improved deposit models and better and more efficient, and therefore more environmentally friendly, extraction techniques. There will be wider benefits for researchers in other international teams and companies as we publish our results. Security of REE supply is a major international issue and the challenges tackled in this research will be relevant to practically all REE deposits. Despite the UK not having world class REE deposits itself, the economy is reliant on REE (e.g. the functional materials and devices industry is worth ~&amp;pound;3 Bn p.a.) and therefore the UK must lead research into the extraction process. Manufacturers who use REE will also benefit from the research by receiving up to date information on prospects for future Nd and HREE supply. This will help plan their longer term product development, as well as shorter term purchasing strategy. Likewise, the results will be useful to inform national and European level policy and to interest, entertain and educate the wider community about the natural characters and importance of the REE.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>SoS RARE research will have an immediate economic impact by improving the prospects for the security of supply of neodymium (Nd) and the key heavy rare earth elements (HREE). The proposal has engaged six core industry partners involved in the exploration and development of new REE mines who will benefit immediately by introduction of our new exploration models and improved techniques for mineral extraction. Processing of REE raw materials is currently a major bottle neck in the value chain, and development of better methods will have an immediate impact on REE supply concerns. This will make projects more economically viable and environmentally friendly, helping to ensure a more stable supply. The four consultant company partners will gain key expertise and experience in exploration and processing which they will spread out into the wider REE mining and processing industries.

The unstable supply and cost of REE remains a major issue for manufacturers that make up a substantial part of the UK economy. A more secure supply chain will allow these manufacturers to better plan their short and long term product development. The research team will provide information on primary supplies, the likely development of future mines and how the supply chain will develop.
REE supply is a global concern. The project will have a global reach, through the industry partners involved (based in and working in the UK, Greenland, Malawi, Namibia, Spain, Canada and Australia), the core research collaborators in Germany, USA, Canada, Brazil and South Africa and wider international network links to Japan, France, and Madagascar. Diversity of supply is the key. This research proposal will place the UK as a centre in REE expertise and at the forefront of critical metals development.

The critical metals issue is requiring changes in UK Government and European Union policy, including increased support for research on primary supplies, recycling of existing metal stocks and substitution. The impact of this research on the prospects for low environmental impact extraction of REE, diversity/security of supply and responsible sourcing will be directly relevant to future policy. The 'race' to engineer REE out of new technologies will be unnecessary and many new applications could be explored. Therefore major impact will occur at the policy level as the research guides the decision making in research funding and legislation for REE.

Few people had even heard of 'rare earths' until the issue of China restricting supply reached the news headlines in 2010, yet this family of elements are ubiquitous in digital and green technologies, from the slimmest mobile phones to giant wind turbines. We will exploit the realisation among the general public of the importance of REE towards their modern high technology life-style and demonstrate the importance of REE chemistry and geology. The REE are extremely interesting and ideal for creative and educational outputs to entertain and inform wider non-technical audiences. Encouraging the public, including school students, to learn more about REE in nature is a key part of our outreach programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345517</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Antananarivo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Madagascar, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Memorandum of understandign with the Univeristy of Antanarivo</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEC46622-25AC-42EC-936C-4B303B05679B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint fieldwork.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c180fe89c504.82053514-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint fieldwork in the Ambohimirahavy and Manongarivo areas.

Abstract:
The Rare Earth Elements (REE: La-Lu) have been highlighted as 'critical materials' as a result of concerns over the security of supply. In particular demand for heavy REE (HREE: Gd-Lu) has increased over the past decade. Ion Adsorption-Type Deposits (IADs) supply the majority of HREE and yttrium to the global market. Containing more than c. 50% ion exchangeable REE (+ yttrium), typically adsorbed to the surface of clay minerals such as kaolinite and halloysite, it is the ease of extraction through leaching that makes IADs economically viable. Economic ion adsorption-type deposits are almost exclusively confined to areas of southern China underlain by metaluminous to weakly peraluminous granites. Notably the most HREE-enriched IADs in China are associated with HREE-enriched muscovite granites that contain easily degradable REE-minerals (e.g. fluorcarbonates) formed during deuteric alteration. The primary control on the formation of HREE-rich ion adsorption type deposits seems to be the presence of easily weathered HREE-bearing minerals in the protoliths, but there has been limited study of how these minerals form. Other than IADs, peralkaline igneous rocks are known to be a substantial source of REE, especially the valuable HREE but processing the 'hard-rock' deposits can be challenging. At Ambohimirahavavy, Madagascar, peralkaline igneous rocks have been weathered to form an ion adsorption deposit which is thus relatively easy to process.

The Ambohimirahavavy prospect is currently unique in hosting a recognised ion adsorption-type deposit developed above alkaline to peralkaline igneous and volcanic rocks, some of which carry REE mineralisation of up to 2.24% TREO. The ion adsorption ores are present within lateritic weathering profiles above these protoliths, and carry an average grade of 835 ppm TREO5. By studying this deposit we aim to understand better the preconditions necessary for the formation of IADs. Preliminary results from leaching experiments on variably mineralised weathered profiles from across the prospect demonstrate that bedrock variations are important in controlling the location of REE mineralisation. This is also evident locally within some laterite profiles, with differences in ion-exchangeable REE content being associated with recognisable changes in protolith composition (e.g. Profile TAND044: weathered pegmatite 738 ppm REE; weathered mudstone 378 ppm REE). Preliminary work has clearly identified the presence of clay sorbed REE above bedrock pegmatite and hydrothermal vein hosted mineralisation. Petrographic observations have shown the bedrock mineralisation to include late magmatic REE-bearing phases (eudialyte, zircon, pyrochlore) and hydrothermal phases (allanite, REE-fluorcarbonates) that could be easily broken down by weathering. Initial observations suggest that the development of the magmatic, and post-magmatic hydrothermal system may have been critical in the formation of an economic deposit by weathering.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c17b45b28745.67288614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PhD student presentation - Rare Earth Element mobility during the genesis and evolution of Ion Adsorption Deposits associated with Alkali Granitoid Complexes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>167EBDFD-B538-4CD1-A1F4-1CBA1EFAED07</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PhD student presentation at project progress meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c17ac10b83e1.48919748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>74200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
