It examines the day-to-day operations of the state veterinary field department and assesses local responses to these interventions. This entails a detailed unpacking of the historiographically neglected interface between African farmers and state veterinarians. Using the 1930s as a starting point enables the capturing of several generations of African voices through oral testimonies, facilitating an analysis of continuity and change over time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The project explores questions of medical hybridisation and the evolution of pluralistic local veterinary knowledges by looking at the impact of western biomedical science on stockowners conceptualisation of disease, treatment of animals and management of the environment. It also considers how African empirical observations about livestock diseases and healing have contributed to the expansion of veterinary research in South Africa. The project includes a national overview of the role of the state in disease control, supported by two case studies, one in KwaZulu-Natal, the other in the North West Province, to bring depth and detail to the analysis of responses and interactions. Methodologically it draws upon a range of archival and published sources, as well as interviews.&lt;/p>

Karen Brown and William Beinart, Outreach Report: African Local Knowledge: Livestock Diseases and Treatments in South Africa, September 2012, 17 pages. The outreach report, which incorporates some key findings in the publications, has not been published but it is available on the web at www.africanstudies.ox.ac.uk. It has been widely circulated to research groups, government departments and at our village research sites in South Africa where it has formed the basis for seminars and discussions. As many of our interlocutors at a village level do not have access to the web or sufficient literacy to read the outreach report, verbal communication of the contents has been essential. 

Impacts have been made at three levels: community, government and specialists. The outreach report was the major research output on which impact was based. Impact at the community level could not rely only on circulation of written material as most African stockowners with whom we had contact had limited literacy. 

Firstly, at the village level, in over 200 interviews we engaged with informants and discussed with them the differences between local and biomedical ideas. Impact was initially achieved through the process of research, verbal communication and follow up. Some informants felt that narrating their testimonies to researchers validated their approach and gave weight to important cultural and veterinary knowledge. Some wanted more information about biomedicines and cheaper access to modern therapeutics. This was a two-way process in that we were doing systematic interviews about local knowledge as well as, on occasion, and especially in follow up interviews and report-backs, responding to questions at the end of interviews. Some informants hoped that their testimonies could lead to reforms such as increased state investment in dipping or subsidised drugs, as well as greater attention to local knowledge and to agricultural education at stock days. 

We returned to communities where we have done research, distributed the outreach report and made direct inputs. Presentations were made to stockowners in North West Province at Fafung (2010 and 2012), Ballantlokwe (2012) and at Mbotyi in the Eastern Cape (twice in 2012). Visits were made to and outreach reports circulated in other research sites in the Eastern Cape (2013). These generated discussions about the recommendations in the outreach report. In Mbotyi we worked for two weeks (2012) with a qualified vet to help interpret the disease environment and investigate further how primary health care can be delivered to local livestock. Our research provided a basis for the vet to understand the social context and description of symptoms. In this village too, we facilitated a dipping day, the first for some time, after discussions about the significance of tick control. Over 600 cattle were dipped (March 2012) and on a subsequent visit (December 2012) we found that dipping had continued with reasonable regularity. 

A major critique of development projects and government interventions in poor rural communities, especially in Africa, has been their top-down approach that often negates their impact. Our research was designed primarily as a 'bottom-up' approach and we were able to facilitate information flows at the community level about scientific knowledge, government policy and projects. 

Secondly, at the level of government, our project has helped to foster greater awareness of local knowledge, particularly in the Eastern Cape. Three meetings were held with the District vet and Animal Health Technicians in Lusikisiki (site of Mbotyi), two in other sites and four, including detailed presentations and discussions, with provincial veterinary officers at Dohne Agricultural Research Institute. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development veterinary section has started an Indigenous Knowledge research initiative for which we are writing a series of papers based on different aspects of our book. The first has been sent on the differences between local and scientific knowledge in respect of naming and diagnosing animals diseases. We will hold further workshops with officers in the provincial service. A Memorandum of Understanding is in preparation for this work with the Department.
Thirdly, we have sustained contact with veterinary specialists as well as other scientists with an interest in this work. This was achieved through meetings at Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, the leading centre in South Africa, from 2009. We also made two presentations there (2011 and 2012) on material that became part of our publications. Dr Arthur Spickett, the leading authority on ticks and tick-borne diseases in South Africa commented on the research: By incorporating cultural, scientific and political perspectives, the authors succeed well in sculpting an authentic historical account of ticks and the dynamics of control strategies and policies in South Africa. These perspectives serve to provide background rationalization to the implementation of relevant policies while their research on local knowledge in rural areas reveals the stark resource and knowledge divide - an aspect in need of continuous urgent attention in future. 
Beyond Onderstepoort, discussions were held at Roodeplaat Agricultural Research Station where scientists are focusing on cultivation of plants used in African medicine; we alerted practitioners to key species used in African veterinary medicine. Papers on our work have also been presented at conferences and seminars in the UK, Europe, the US, Kenya and South Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>414F0EC7-1076-4EA7-8BAE-1B20705568E4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545d0746351776.22421530</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is a major contribution to the study of local knowledge and will have an important impact in relevant social sciences and the social aspects of veterinary science. These impacts are on-going and incremental. Our book details African ideas about disease causation and treatment and discusses how our informants view veterinary medicine and animal management. We have presented papers at inter-disciplinary conferences and seminars and discussed our findings with state veterinary officers, animal health technicians and research scientists at Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute and the University of Fort Hare, the major centres of relevant research. In South Africa, there is a dearth of academic research exploring animal health at grassroots level and many see a crisis in veterinary provision. Discussions with South African specialists have alerted them to the importance of African ideas, especially environment explanations of disease, as well as some supernatural ideas (such as ritual pollution) which are central to local understanding of epidemiology. These ideas, along with the sometimes equivocal attitude of Africans towards biomedicine can have significant impacts on the emergence and control of enzootic and epizootic diseases as well the success of interventions. Our research has shown the importance of academic liaison between scientists and social scientists to foster the development of a more inclusive understanding of disease and treatment. Rural development in this sphere, still of great importance to poor African communities, is in part contingent upon understanding the views of stockowners and working with them to ameliorate the health of their herds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Feedback to farmers: At the request of farmers, who wanted greater access to biomedical knowledge, Brown gave a powerpoint presentation to stockowners at the community hall in the village of Fafung (2010). This generated an interesting discussion about different forms of knowledge and provided a potential model for further outreach work with rural communities. In November 2012 we had follow up meetings in Fafung, Bollontlokwe and Mbotyi. In Mbotyi Beinart worked with a UK trained vet to stimulate discussion and provide guidance on treatment. They examined livestock, administered some primary health care, and facilitated a dipping day.



Opportunities for liaison between stockowners and state veterinary departments:Our interviewees were mainly, but not exclusively, poorer livestock owners rather than commercial producers. Some lacked literacy and were unable to access biomedical knowledge or products as they could not read or communicate in English or Afrikaans. They found state officials distant, and sometimes unhelpful. Discussions during and after our interviews were of significant value in transmitting information. Our experiences showed that stock days, on which representatives of government and drug companies provided some education, as well as less formal presentations such as the one given by Brown at Fafung, were an important means of imparting information to stockowners. Our research showed that stockowners do listen to new ideas about animal health and will incorporate some, but not necessarily all aetiological explanations and therapeutics, into their livestock management strategies. In general we found stockowners were more willing to embrace biomedical drugs than biomedical explanations for disease. This information can inform future strategies for working with rural populations with the aim of improving livestock health and fostering rural development.



The long term impact will largely be through our monograph and summary outreach reports. The former makes a theoretical contribution in the comparative analysis of local knowledge and gives a detailed account of our interviews amongst rural communities. Our study highlights the significant crisis in veterinary services. State services have partly been withdrawn, and smallholder farmers cannot afford the full range of biomedical treatments nor do they necessarily prioritise these. At the same time the proportion of livestock in African hands is increasing as land reform gathers pace. Our introduction outlines these key issues and the subsequent chapters explore the nature of African knowledge and its implications for veterinary services. The issue of dipping has provided an important prism for this analysis and raises questions about the role of the state and the uncertainties surrounding the control of diseases. We focus particularly on the importance of local knowledge in the environmental sphere and discuss interpretations of disease and available treatments. We anticipate that our publications will have an important impact on academic debate around plural systems of knowledge. In the current political context of South Africa, and Africa more generally, where veterinary scientists are encouraged to include local knowledge in their research, our findings will stimulate further debate. The outreach reports will provide a basis for institutional discussions and workshops. We will be directly involved in presentations to veterinary officials and rural communities and we hope the reports will result in a more sustained set of workshops.


 Our papers have raised interest amongst scholars from a number of academic disciplines including historians, anthropologists, scientists and social scientists. Conference and seminar presentations have been attended by people who are interested not only in African history and social sciences but also environmental history, agricultural development and the generation of local knowledge more broadly. We have found that the papers dealing with the hybrid character of African knowledge have encouraged particularly lively debate and helped to promote our work. 



There is greater concern about local knowledge in the South African government since Thabo Mbeki's African Renaissance project. Considerable funding is being offered for such research and our work ties in with these projects. Vets and academic scientists have expressed an interest in our findings as these have implications for their own work. The Eastern Cape veterinary department has established an indigenous knowledge research unit and our work will feed directly into its data base. Discussions have begun on the use of this material for the training of Animal Health Technicians. The North West Province Department of Agriculture has specifically requested our outreach report for their use. We visited South Africa in November 2012 to promote our findings through talks and meetings. The project has enabled us to expand our existing academic links with Fort Hare, Rhodes University and the University of Pretoria. We have also explained our work in community forums where knowledge about disease and treatment is at a premium. We are hoping to be able to carry out more follow up work in South Africa and hope that our project will help to foster greater liaison between vets, animal health technicians and African farmers over the longer term.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9BD26103-4B88-4B30-977B-0B1E63B7951A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3883502188.9614897b2efd406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.africanstudies.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2B16608C-F514-432F-83BA-E3DEF2528CE7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Animal disease and the limits of local knowledge: dealing with ticks and tick-borne diseases in South Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f9bfb181c1926dd7c072e90ee249126c"><gtr:id>f9bfb181c1926dd7c072e90ee249126c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa1fa13c221e0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A67CB16D-A9C7-4D4A-86AC-FEF881C2BDC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>African Local Knowledge &amp;amp; Livestock Health: Diseases &amp;amp; Treatments in South Africa</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/139f2ca31e56b68cfaf0ed37ff63c4d5"><gtr:id>139f2ca31e56b68cfaf0ed37ff63c4d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beinart, William; Brown, Karen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-84701-083-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_92738030323b80bb42</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-0158</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E003389/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
