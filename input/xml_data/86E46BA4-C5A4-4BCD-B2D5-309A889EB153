Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently identified these diseases as ?targets of opportunity? to improve global health. By providing safe and effective drug treatments to individuals, mass drug administration (MDA) can control seven NTDs.
The proposed research aims to: i) evaluate the effect of different MDA-based interventions on the infection prevalence and intensity of two NTDs: schistosomiasis and trachoma, and on the likelihood of their elimination; and ii) evaluate the performance of the diagnostic tools currently used for Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation of interventions against these two NTDs. Robust statistical analysis of relevant data will help to optimize the design of future NTD control programmes, and evaluate the impact of current strategies so that a better quality of life for some of the world?s poorest communities can be achieved. The results of this research will have implications for infections prevalent in the UK, such as genital Chlamydia, partly responsible for infertility in reproductive age women.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The two infectious diseases discussed in this fellowship application (schistosomiasis, and trachoma) are among the most prevalent of the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), an umbrella term encompassing a group of parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections collectively imposing a similar disease burden to that of malaria and HIV. Decisions on Mass Drug Administration (MDA), estimates of the burden of morbidity, infection prevalence and intensity of infection and evaluation of control measures, all depend on the results from diagnostic tests.
 
The proposed research aims to use advanced biostatistical analysis to further understanding of the effect upon the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and of the ocular bacteria causing trachoma, and the likelihood of their elimination, of interventions based on MDA, as well as to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic tools currently used for the Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) of these two infections. 

The main data sources to be used are: (i) annual longitudinal surveys from the Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) National Schistosomiasis Control Programmes in Niger and Tanzania (iii) monthly longitudinal trachoma studies conducted in The Gambia and Tanzania. 

Latent Variable models (LVM) will be fitted in these datasets as measurement error is acknowledged and estimated, by making use of the information from multiple indicators while validation of scales is particularly important in resource-constrained settings.

Specific objectives are to: (i) classify people according to different intensities of Schistosoma haematobium infection who experience poor quality of life in Niger at baseline and follow-ups in order to address questions of schistosomiasis morbidity; (ii) estimate changes in sensitivities and specificities of one and two consecutive days of stool samples for the intensity classifications of S. mansoni infection following treatment; (iii) estimate the true intensity of S. mansoni infection pre- and post-treatment in the Tanzanian schistosomiasis control programme so that its impact can be evaluated; (iv) quantify changes in sensitivity and specificity of active trachoma disease for true infection status at follow-up particularly focused on the households and the dynamics of infection and disease; (v) estimate the true prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection at baseline and follow-up in order to address questions of persistence in some infected households. 

LVM applied to these detailed datasets, provides a unique opportunity to answer important questions related to human health issues in the tropics as well as a useful illustration to serve as a guide to the careful application of these modelling ideas to other conditions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326241</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Life Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborator on succesful MRC grant entitled 'Childhood Tuberculosis Integrating Tools for improved diagnosis and vaccines'</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2AD9666-6837-4B76-ADE6-DE9E0D78813A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As mentioned above, in early November we heard that the programme grant application was succesful.

A main discussion topic was accelerated research on diagnostics with demonstrated satisfactory performance in large-scale public health programmes for a) disease mapping to guide interventions; b) monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) of impact of interventions particularly for the prompt detection of possible drug resistance; and c) assessment of elimination of infection.

This was an extraordinary gathering of international politicians, pharmaceutical chief executives and global health organisation heads threatened to take the 'neglect' out of 'neglected tropical diseases' (NTDs). Together they made a number of significant commitments to provide treatments, research and development funding and cooperation to control, eliminate or even eradicate ten NTDs by 2020.

All partners and attendees endorsed the &amp;quot;London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, &amp;quot; in which they pledged new levels of collaborative effort and tracking of progress in tackling 10 of the 17 neglected tropical diseases currently on WHO's list.

I was fascinated to witness how clinicians from Oslo University Hospital as well as Kwazulu-Natal University lab researchers diagnose FGS. Their consortium identified my analyses as key to evaluate non-invasive and syndromic FGS diagnostics. Senior members of the Leiden University Diagnostics and Epidemiology Research Group became interested in my approaches to evaluate intestinal schistosomiasis diagnostics they have developed and used in longitudinal Ugandan studies-so that rapid cost-effective field diagnostics can be identified. Recently I gave a special seminar at the Task Force for Global Health, in Atlanta, US, illustrating how Latent Markov Models apart from evaluating diagnostics they can provide useful insights in answering key epidemiological questions about persistence of disease, clearance of infection, or probability of reinfection. 

These novel proposed analyses the evaluation and validation of NTDs diagnostics can become generic tools and bridge gaps in the evidence base on diagnostics' performance in the developing world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6CD45D42-746F-4528-8D69-08A01CDF2758</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several academic and research groups are interested in the afore mentioned statistical approaches and I am now working of developping further these potential collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>ZASveSSc9TR</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Could modern statistical methods be useful tools for NTDs control program M &amp; E research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>I have provided estimates of sensitivity and specificity for different diagnostic tests by latent class analysis (LCA) for schistosomiasis data acquired from the John Hopkins University (this is in addition to the data I am analysing for my fellowship work).

I am in the process of developing similar models for evaluating diagnostics of soil transmitted heminths (STHs) in India for The Partnership for Child Development (PCD) within Imperial College (this is again in addition to the data I am analysing for my fellowship work).
