is the commonest form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently the diagnosis can only be made by kidney biopsy, and a single biopsy provides limited information about the future risk of kidney failure. In addition, since this disease can run in families, there is a need for a test to predict whether relatives of patients might develop the disease. We aim to use genetic analysis, together with clinical measurements and disease markers, such as deglycosylated IgA to develop a way of predicting which patients are at risk of progression and which relatives are at risk of developing the disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A) Family-based and population-based linkage analysis
B) Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for deglycosylated IgA1 serum levels;
C) Stratification using susceptibility genetic variants (HLA haplotypes, structural variants across the CFH-CFHR);
D) Resequencing through NGS of a selected subsample of informative families 
E) Variants Validation
F) Identification of biomarkers for IgAN and Bayesian Model</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease in up to 40% of patients, who thus require dialysis or kidney transplant within 20 years of renal biopsy-proven diagnosis. This is a significant economic burden on patients and healthcare system in the UK. This translational medicine project will better elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and also ultimately provide a refined non-invasive tool useful for screening at-risk relatives and for stratification of IgA nephropathy patients in order to achieve their personalized treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>495962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leiden University Medical Center</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Glycomics Analysis of IgAN Patients and Healthy Twins</gtr:description><gtr:id>036E58F0-7B25-43BE-A87F-9238D5BA616C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is on-going and the data has not been analysed yet.

Often family members are with the patients so they are provided with information about the study too. Our study has 16 other NHS trusts also recruiting patients, so the discussion with patients, family and friends occurs at these sites too.

We have combined a case control study for IgAN - aimed to the identification of glycans involved in the disease and in the disease progression - and carried out a heritability study in the general population using MZ and DZ twins to understand how much of the IgA glycome is under genetic control.

IgA glycomics data have been characterised in an additional sample of 2500 twins, for which multiple -omics data (including transcriptomics, epigenomics, IgG glycomics and whole serum, whole genome sequencing, gut metagenomics, metabolomics) are available. This study, which is possibly the largest glycomics experiment on IgA to date, will identify genes, pathways and environmental factors associated with IgA glycans.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A82E8FDD-2FA0-4045-84EF-48C2F21A4D3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Glycomics method for the IgA molecules have been improved and tested on IgAN case control study. Glycans involved with IgAN risk and progression have been identified.

Once the multi-omics analyses of the large 2500 twins sample will be completed we will get a better picture of how the IgA glycans assortment relates with the host genome and the gut microbiome composition, which are the processes involved and their metabolomics signatures.

Apart from clarifying the role of IgA in IgAN development these studies will provide novel insight into the biology of IgA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e02ce9536ba3.46079214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>IgA Glycomics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Family-based designs, from twin studies to isolated populations with their complex genealogical data, are a valuable resource for genetic studies of heritable molecular biomarkers.

famCNV is now at version 2.1. This new version allows a more flexible input, and quantile normalisation can be automatically applied to each phenotype to improve normality of the response variables. Moreover, its output includes also beta and percentage of variance explained. The significance of the results is also now tested both through formal likelihood testing and through an empirical adaptive procedure. Version 2.0 is also more efficient in its implementation, allowing multithreading. The new version allows using both family data and unrelated subjects where the kinship matrix is estimated from the genetic data.

We used famCNV to identify CNVs involved in IgAN using data previously generated in samples from the MRC/Kidney Research UK National DNA Bank for Glomerulonephritis, which are now under replication in an independent sample.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E767418-F8D2-4732-A7D8-8789F966C018</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Raw intensity data from GWAS panels can be used to model association between CNV and phenotype using both family and independent samples. The new implementation 2.0 have been used to study the association between IgA and CNV in case control and family studies, and of the deglycosylated IgA. It has used also for additional projects (non IgAN) in our lab, including the identification of association between CNV at the AMY1 gene and obesity susceptibility.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e065bea17078.27010028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>famCNV</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/project/famCNV/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1400E37B-997A-422A-B9CE-064D53C188A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>IgA1 Glycosylation Is Heritable in Healthy Twins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3d3e7680f77123cc1958908917bb4a4b"><gtr:id>3d3e7680f77123cc1958908917bb4a4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lomax-Browne HJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1046-6673</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d64ce5dbe24.82875637</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>58319983-F269-4FA5-9580-432331E6069E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Circulating complement factor H-related proteins 1&amp;nbsp;and 5 correlate with disease activity in IgA nephropathy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Kidney international</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/090e0a58d640c017401a3e1d74d4124e"><gtr:id>090e0a58d640c017401a3e1d74d4124e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Medjeral-Thomas NR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0085-2538</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a34f535da27a9.69269559</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>98454779-FB52-4F60-93E6-FC80BA25E660</gtr:id><gtr:title>PopPAnTe: population and pedigree association testing for quantitative data.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC genomics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cd87a7b1cd888240f0865f19cda0ee6c"><gtr:id>cd87a7b1cd888240f0865f19cda0ee6c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Visconti A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2164</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c9597b7b56b1.66190263</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>51393FFD-0F62-49CF-96AB-62E981DE69DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multiple rare genetic variants co-segregating with familial IgA nephropathy all act within a single immune-related network.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of internal medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/816092106a5c2c089ca181f5d3c89cc6"><gtr:id>816092106a5c2c089ca181f5d3c89cc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cox SN</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0954-6820</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d3a1e44d353.91399258</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>619E06FD-E300-437B-9E75-7C1A6C1689D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genome-wide scan identifies a copy number variable region at 3p21.1 that influences the TLR9 expression levels in IgA nephropathy patients.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of human genetics : EJHG</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc41ebd09ae314c6b650619f5c106da9"><gtr:id>fc41ebd09ae314c6b650619f5c106da9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sallustio F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1018-4813</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5460bc2a555724.12265914</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K01353X/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>2EEE0958-6BE1-4D16-B86B-5D954CD37219</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Renal and Urogenital</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
