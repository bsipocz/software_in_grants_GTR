The objectives of the study are to explore and discuss the process by which these capital forms enable and emerge within those networks, to analyse the relationship between social and institutional capital, to assess how this relationship facilitates or constrains leader and leadership development within SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures, and to discuss how human, social and institutional capital contribute towards a social process of leadership development.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research design will be qualitative and longitudinal in nature, with analysis conducted in line with an interpretivist approach. A case study of a cohort of participants from action learning sets will be utilized as a method of inquiry, with in-depth semi-structured interviews as a primary means of data collection.

These findings have the potential to impact the following groups of individuals;

1) Owner-managers of SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures

2) First-time entrepreneurs

3) Chambers of Commerce and other business and development networks

4) Policymakers

The first two groups of individuals are regarded as the key beneficiaries of the study, and the impact in this regard will be considerable. To elaborate, Morrison (2003) notes that the specific training needs of the majority of SME owner-managers in Britain has gone unfulfilled, despite the concerted efforts and considerable funding invested over the last two decades. This has been attributed to the complexity and diversity of these organizations' needs. The provision is not geared towards these enterprises, despite their needs for localized and customized solutions. 

Gibb (2009) argues that institutional factors or norms substantially explain the market failure for training and development geared towards SMEs. These barriers are broadly classified into two groups - those that appear to influence the way in which general education and training is approached in Western societies, and those that derive from the traditional cultures and behaviours of the university business schools. 

Findings explicating the roles of and relationships between the specified capital forms will add further detail to the process of leadership development in the context of SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures. It is expected that these findings will have significant relevance to leaders of these firms, along with first-time entrepreneurs. For example, findings may assist their self-directed efforts towards developing the personal and organizational leadership capabilities, in instances where developmental resources are lacking. 

The study would also have substantial relevance to business and development network organizations and policymakers. For example, benefits may potentially yield in terms of improving the design and delivery of capacity building activities that support the SME sector in the United Kingdom, or the effectiveness of existing initiatives. It is also expected that the findings will represent a foundation for other research inquiring into leader and leadership development initiatives for SMEs and entrepreneurial ventures of different stages and/or profit orientation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant funds ongoing part-time PhD research, and as such, the findings described here are preliminary and still being developed through ongoing data collection and analysis. The PhD research is situated in the topic area of Entrepreneurial Leadership, and specifically, investigates leadership relationships amongst owner-managers and members of staff within the contexts of growth-oriented Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The expected submission date for this PhD is August 2018. 

There are three main findings currently in development. Firstly, the research has found that close analyses of SME organizational settings can offer a contextualized understanding of leadership. Interviews for this study have, for example, explored how participants interpret the structure, culture or values of their respective organizations, or the ways in which they collaborate in their work activities. Drawing on principles of qualitative research, conceptualizations of leadership have been interpreted by the researcher in the course of data analysis. This approach to investigating leadership and its outputs may be framed as a contribution to the field of study. This is particularly so, given the wider recognition that implications of organizational scale or contexts on leadership practice have not been sufficiently appreciated in existing empirical work on entrepreneurial leadership.

Second, and through a close focus on organizational contexts, the research has found that leadership may be conceptualized as relationships of authority between owner-managers and members of staff in SMEs. In some instances, the data suggests that these relationships are top-down and hierarchical, whilst in others, there is evidence to suggest that the authority to lead is distributed and negotiated amongst organizational members. This conceptualization of leadership as a relationship of authority between individuals is a contribution to the topic area of entrepreneurial leadership. Existing research has tended to rely on leadership theories that focus on the personalities and behaviours of individual owner-managers or leaders, marginalizing the roles of other organization members. Further, such leadership theories have been adopted or advocated, even as significant theoretical advances have been made to investigate leadership as a relational concept. 

Third, the research has found that the concept of 'growth' in SME contexts is multi-dimensional. The data suggests that within such organizations, growth can refer to business expansion, the development of an organizational vision or culture, or the objectification and formalization of organizational values. Further, the data tends to draw attention to how growth is multiply perceived, and how this is articulated, framed, advocated or contested by different stakeholders within organizations. Consequently, the multi-dimensionality of growth is also being developed as one of the main contributions of the research, as this theme is yet to be explored more widely in the topic area of entrepreneurial leadership.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Preliminary findings draw attention to leadership relationships amongst owner-managers and staff of SMEs, and these relationships are based on a highly contextualized analysis of the organizational context. For academic routes, the research instruments can similarly be applied to SMEs of different sizes (ie. Micro-business, small enterprise, medium enterprise) and operating in different sectors, including those that are non-commercial (eg. social enterprises), to further develop more contextualized accounts of leadership. In doing so, such studies can lay the foundation for customizing leadership development programs to meet the unique needs of SMEs. According to academic literature, such bespoke provision is highly relevant given that it has been neglected in favour of more generic and mass-market approaches.

Participants in the study have been informed they will receive a key findings report following the completion of data collection. It is anticipated that this report may illustrate the complexity of their leadership relationships, the influences of these, and impact on business maintenance, growth and/or performance. Once submitted, the intention is to follow up with participants to obtain feedback on their experiences with engaging in the research and utility of the report for their own practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F2B77794-33DD-43D0-A56F-A2FAD0A5DC2A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f9a58338b71.43135088</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002671/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2F0BA056-5E00-4769-9080-8085A23EC6F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Entrepreneurship</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39B8C78D-8933-4158-88D3-165B9F15A254</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Leadership</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
