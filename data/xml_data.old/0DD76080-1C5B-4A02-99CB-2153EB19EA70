Protein-coated microcrystals (PCMC) are a dry powder composed of a crystalline core onto which biomolecules are coated. PCMC are attractive for vaccine use as they are stable at high temperature and humidity. The aim of this work is to use
proteins currently included in vaccines against whooping cough caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis as a model system to establish if these proteins retain their functional integrity when formulated as a dry powder. It is anticipated that the pertussis antigen PCMC formulations will serve as models for the development of more stable formulations of other protein vaccine candidates. The physical state of the proteins on the PCMC will be examined by microscopy and techniques designed to determine how the protein folds on to the PCMC. To ensure retention of functional activity, the PCMC will be solubilised and injected into mice and the immune responses to the PCMC, including a capacity to protect the mice against challenge with virulent B. pertussis, will be determined and compared with the responses to the unprocessed protein preparations. The stability of the proteins contained in the PCMC dry powder preparations (with regard to maintenance of a protective immune response) will be determined at different temperatures and humidity, to monitor the potential shelf-life of the vaccine components.
Combinations of different pertussis proteins will be formulated as PCMC to determine which combination provides the most effective protective immune response. Administration of the PCMC formulations by different routes of inoculation, as an alternative to needle injection, will also be examined. Verification that proteins formulated as PCMC retain functional activity would lead to evaluation of other vaccine components as PCMC and the possible formulation of commercial vaccines in this form, as their potential stability would offer the ability to extend shelf-life and allow vaccine storage without the need for refrigeration, a feature that is particularly attractive for vaccine use in developing countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Protein-coated microcrystals (PCMC) are novel particles composed of a soluble crystalline core onto which bioactive molecules are coated. An attractive feature of PCMC for vaccine use is their physical robustness and resistance to damage caused by high temperature and humidity. Major drawbacks to the efficient use of many current vaccines are their limited shelf-life and their requirement for cold-chain storage. The aim of this work is to establish that protein antigens retain functional integrity when formulated in dry powder form as PCMC. The PCMC formulations will serve as models for the development of more stable formulations of other protein vaccine candidates for parenteral delivery after solubilisation or mucosal application as a dry powder. Protective antigens currently included in pertussis acellular vaccines, detoxified pertussis toxin (dPT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) together with another potential pertussis vaccine antigen, detoxified adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA*), will be formulated as PCMC dry powder preparations. The PCMC formulations of pertussis antigens will be characterised with regard to physical size, morphology, protein structure and antigen loading using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy or laser light scattering, and protein conformation determined by solid state circular dichroism and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy. To determine retention of functional activity, the humoral and cellular immune responses to the PCMC, including protection against challenge with virulent B. pertussis, will be determined after solubilisation and parenteral administration to mice and compared with the responses to the unprocessed antigen preparations. This will include serum antibody isotype determination, cytokine assays after stimulation of splenocytes, splenocyte proliferative responses, dendritic cell surface marker analysis, macrophage phagocytosis assays and protection studies. The stability of the antigens as PCMC dry powder formulations (with regard to maintenance of a protective immune response) will be determined at different temperatures and humidity, to monitor the potential shelf-life of the vaccine components. The inclusion of FHA in current acellular pertussis vaccines is controversial and the relative roles of FHA and CyaA* in the immune responses to the other pertussis antigens and to protection against challenge will be determined by replacement of FHA with CyaA*. The feasibility of mucosal and intradermal delivery routes for PCMC antigen formulations will be tested, after solubilisation and dry powder administration, respectively, with a view to reducing reactogenicity and providing an alternative to parenteral administration.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>455289</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB07CF27-594E-4638-BE11-4C54F89E37E0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein coated microcrystals formulated with model antigens and modified with calcium phosphate exhibit enhanced phagocytosis and immunogenicity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Vaccine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66"><gtr:id>6f76a7f265485c2dbe40074d7948aa66</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0264-410X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>JM8f3BVB5c8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0801955</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>D8F3A27D-084A-40BB-A046-087DACE23410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.4  Vaccines</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
