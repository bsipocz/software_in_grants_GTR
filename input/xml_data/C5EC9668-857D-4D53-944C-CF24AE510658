This suggests that an early insult, correlated with season of birth, has permanently damaged their immune function. On-going studies in The Gambia are investigating the biological mechanisms underlying this early-life programming of immunity (see separate database entry). It is critical to test whether the Gambian findings are a rare phenomenon caused by a very localised environmental challenge (e.g. seasonal aflatoxin contamination of foods) or whether the effects are more widespread and may be related to common challenges (e.g. fetal growth retardation). The objective of this programme is to extend the Gambian research to other seasonally-modulated environments in order to test whether the results can be replicated and, if so, to explore common mechanisms. A worldwide search was made for cohorts in which adult mortality could be related to detailed information on season of birth. Such cohorts are rare in developing countries since accurate birth records were rarely kept in the past. Two suitable cohorts have been identified in Bangladesh and Pakistan, and a further historical cohort from 17th century Finland when winter seasonality was profound. Studies in Bangladesh: Analysis is completed of &amp;gt;86,000 deaths from a cohort exceeding 250,000 individuals studied in the rural Matlab area of Bangladesh by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease (ICDDRB) in Dhaka. Prospective studies are also in progress with ICDDRB in the form of add-ons to a large prenatal dietary supplementation study and a breast-feeding promotion study. This allows us to extend our findings from The Gambia which indicate strong seasonal effects on thymic size in infants. The Gambian results suggest possible influences of pre-natal nutrition, infections and trophic factors in breast-milk. Each of these are being re-examined in Bangladesh using thymic ultrasound. The data confirm our Gambian findings of strong season of birth and season of measurement effects on thymic size. Studies in Pakistan: In collaboration with the Department of Preventative Paediatrics in Lahore we are looking at early-life predictors of adult disease in a cohort of adults originally monitored in detail from their birth (in the slums of Lahore in the 1960s and 70s). Immune function was assessed by antibody response to vaccination and results suggest that size at birth influences antibody responses to a polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine 30 years later, thus confirming the concept of early-life programming of immune function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2000-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>619227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U123261403</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
