To investigate the biology of malignant germ cell tumours in childhood, in order to contribute to improved ways of looking after children with such cancers.

Research Proposal:
Malignant germ cell tumours (MGCTs) derive from egg or sperm producing cells. There are several different types classified according to their microscopic appearances, although all are treated in the same way. An understanding of the biological behaviour of tumours is essential to continued progress in developing new and more effective treatments. An important area for study in cancer is the genetic changes that can occur in the tumour itself. These changes may give an indication of the likely response to treatment in individual tumours. Therefore the most aggressive treatment may be directed at those cases with the poorest prognosis, while the good risk cases may be spared some of the short and long term toxicity of the more intensive treatment. By analysing the entire UK tumour bank (United Kingdom Children?s Cancer Study Group) of MGCTs and other samples provided from international collaborations it should be possible to identify genes that improve diagnosis and potentially treatment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background:
Paediatric malignant germ cell tumours (MGCTs) are a heterogenous group of tumours occurring at several different anatomical sites. They account for 4% of childhood malignancies and have an annual incidence of 5 per million. Understanding of the biological behaviour of these tumours lags significantly behind that of other paediatric tumours and leukaemias and apart from an association between alpha-fetoprotein levels and outcome, little is known about the factors influencing prognosis. Limited information is available presently regarding the genomic abnormalities seen in paediatric MGCTs. In particular, it is unclear whether the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in paediatric MGCTs is associated with distinct patterns of genetic abnormality or whether fundamental genetic abnormalities are shared between tumours of different histological types. Most genetic studies have been performed on adult tumours, where isochromosome 12p is a consistent finding. However, this abnormality appears rare in the paediatric analyses reported to date. Additionally, there is currently no information available concerning global gene expression patterns in paediatric MGCTs. We have therefore obtained the entire United Kingdom Children?s Cancer Study Group?s (UKCCSG) tumour bank for this tumour group and are obtaining additional samples from international collaborations.
Overall aims:
1. To study gene expression characteristics of the entire UKCCSG national collection of paediatric MGCTs using microarray technology.
2. To validate gene expression findings using real time PCR, Northern hybridisation, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry, as appropriate.
3. To relate patterns of gene expression to genomic abnormalities in the same group of tumours using array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH).
4. To identify patterns of gene expression that are common to MGCTs of different histological types.
5. To identify pats of gene expression that correlate with clinical features, histological type and outcome, including age, site and response to treatment.
6. To define gene expression patterns in MGCTs that may help to improve diagnosis and estimation of prognosis and/or suggest novel therapeutic targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>214536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G84/6701</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
