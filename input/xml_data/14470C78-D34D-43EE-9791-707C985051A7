Musicology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L006820/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project, led by Prof Tim Crawford in the Computing Department of Goldsmiths College, University of London, brings together 15 researchers to effect a Digital Transformation of the discipline of musicology. It is an opportunity to transform the discipline's impact and status by recognising the full implications of its multidisciplinary nature and taking advantage of the potentials of technology for studying the vast musical resources of the internet. 
The world of music has been already transformed by the digital revolution. The same technology that has given unprecedented access to music for a vast and ever-growing international audience can open musicology up to the world - anyone and everyone can contribute by a variety of means enabled by that technology. We will show how the computational tools of music information retrieval (MIR) can be enhanced and adapted to the needs of musicologists, and how state-of-the-art developments in the Semantic Web can be exploited both to make their work more relevant and more sustainable, so that their methods can be easily re-used on new data.
This project will stimulate creativity through multidisciplinary collaborative working. In the past, musicologists have tended to be lone scholars; regular collaboration in a multidisciplinary research environment will in future be essential for them to find what is &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; in potentially huge collections of music.
We shall be using MIR tools in three main strands of research. Two of these are typical subjects for musicology and will be conducted by world-leading experts: 16th-century music and Wagnerian leitmotives. These will use state-of-the-art score- and audio-analysis techniques to extend the range of musicological investigation beyond the normal limitation to printed scores. We'll also be doing psychological work at Goldsmiths to study why leitmotives are so recognisable (or not). Our third main research strand is entirely novel, being nothing less than a prototype for a new 'musicology of the social media'. Music is now created, recorded, distributed, re-used and shared entirely online throughout the world and we will explore a whole new way of studying it and the online spread of musical ideas.
We'll also get a group of musicologists to work for six months on their own research ideas alongside technologists who'll help to realise them. The fruits of this work will be presented at a public workshop and published online and in book form. These mini-projects will be launched at a networking/sandpit meeting which will be recorded and presented online. The website and blog will be used for dynamic and ongoing engagement between the researchers, the research community, and the music industry.
Through this project technologists in the music industry will see that musicology helps them answer the needs of their clients by offering better means of access to the music they want to hear. The digital revolution in music delivery and re-use raises many crucial issues to do with creativity, authorship, marketing, copyright and commercial value beyond those normally associated with musicology. Combining the analytical methods of musicology and the power of digital methods brings intellectual rigour and empirical validity to these debates. Musicologists need this cross-disciplinary background to contribute most effectively and to create new and valuable roles within the music industry.
Musicology should not be an 'ivory-tower' discipline; most people are interested in where music comes from, how it is conceived and made, how it affects us and society. Music goes on in people's minds, and the study of music is essentially about interactions between people. Because of this, music raises a complex mixture of philosophical, psychological and intellectual challenges; so it is a particularly fruitful domain for working through technical challenges which will be more widely applicable to the Digital Humanities and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is an opportunity to transform the impact and status of musicology within the UK by recognising the full implications of its multidisciplinary nature and taking advantage of the potentials of technology for studying the vast musical resources of the internet.

The same technology that has given unprecedented access to music for a vast and ever-growing international audience could open musicology up to the world - anyone and everyone can contribute by a variety of means enabled by that technology.
The discipline of musicology now needs to catch up.

We will engage musicologists to work for six months on their own novel research ideas with technologists helping to realise them. The fruits of this work will be presented at a public workshop and published online and in book form. We regard this as a vital component of the project's impact, ensuring sustainability of the outcomes and as a major way of engagement with issues such as IP and rights-protected data. These mini-projects will be launched at a networking/sandpit meeting which will be recorded and presented online. The website and blog will be used for dynamic and ongoing engagement between the researchers, the research community, and non-academic stakeholders such as the music industry.
Computational techniques can take their place alongside conventional methods of musicology. They will transform the discipline so that it can begin to use contemporary and future online music resources for investigation, which it cannot do at present. To achieve this, at first musicologists must collaborate routinely with technologists to use their methods, but eventually these will become part of standard training.
Through this project technologists working in the music industry will come to realise that incorporating musicology helps them to answer the needs of their clients by offering better means of access to the music they want to hear. There is real potential here for genuine Knowledge Transfer. 
The digital revolution in music delivery and re-use raises many crucial issues to do with creativity, authorship, marketing, copyright and commercial value beyond those normally associated with musicology. The combination of the analytical methods of musicology and the power of digital methods brings intellectual rigour and empirical validity to these debates. Musicologists need this cross-disciplinary background to contribute most effectively and to create new and valuable roles within the music industry.
Musicology need not - and should not - be an 'ivory-tower' discipline; most people are interested in where some kind of music comes from, how it is conceived and made, how it affects us and society. Music goes on in people's heads, and the study of music is essentially about interactions between people. Because of this, music raises a complex mixture of philosophical, psychological and intellectual challenges; so it is a particularly fruitful domain for working through technical challenges which will be more widely applicable to the Digital Humanities and beyond.
By including three PhD students, who will benefit from joint supervision by musicologists and technologists, as well as 4/5 mini-projects bringing researchers from different domains together, this project is - as far as we are aware - unprecedented in its aspiration to pass on cross-disciplinary lessons to the next generation. This will result over time in a transformation of the musicological researcher into a multi-skilled professional with a wide range of employment possibilities outside academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1612594</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Oxford Illinois Digital Libraries Placement Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4CD726E-A32C-43C7-B9B6-10DCBD2E39C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Semantic alignment and linking tool supporting the bridging and combined access of diverse sets of linked data</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b9ef931eb6.99118128-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Useful collaboration on some essential software for our project</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Oxford Illinois Digital Libraries Placement Programme.

All places were quickly filled, and a bursary provided from the AHRC Digital Transformations Fellow's budget. We used the free place to which participation entitled us to provide a further student bursary. Members of the Transforming Musicology research team were engaged in this unanticipated outreach/impact activity, organising and presenting lectures to a group of c20 students from all over the world. The project's profile was further raised by our plenary presentations to the entire Summer School during the week. The Summer School was repeated in July 2016 with a similar level of impact. As before, all places were quickly taken up; in this second year we were able to offer three bursaries. Contacts with students on these courses (in some cases, themselves established researchers) enabled at least two significant collaborations in follow-up research.

Members of the Transforming Musicology research team were engaged in this unanticipated outreach/impact activity, organising and presenting lectures to a group of c20 students from all over the world. The project's profile was further raised by our plenary presentations to the entire Summer School during the week.
The Summer School was repeated in July 2016 with a similar level of impact. As before, all places were quickly taken up; in this second year we were able to offer three bursaries. 
Contacts with students on these courses (in some cases, themselves established researchers) enabled at least two significant collaborations in follow-up research.

&amp;quot; my congratulations on what I thought was a very successful event on Saturday. The fact that we had to virtually be forcibly ejected from the room shows how interesting all those who attended found it. I was particularly impressed by the way in which you had developed so quickly tools and procedures (such as the annotated score) which seem to me potentially of interest to other types of research. I was also struck by the way in which the research was raising fascinating research questions around the nature of audience reactions and the wider performativity of data. I reported on the event to the Theme Advisory Group on Tuesday who were also very interested in the day's activities. Once you have all recovered, we should have a discussion about future possibilities for building on this excellent initial piece of public engagement, and also about the potential for further developing links through this work to other AHRC themes.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dec66f6874f9.61446941</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at DLfM 2016, &quot;In Collaboration with In Concert: Reflecting a Digital Library as Linked Data for Performance Ephemera&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E65A55E2-A369-4C13-B070-DE3C2A33D10F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation, at a workshop organised by members of Transforming Musicology, was an outcome of a collaboration between the Transforming Musicology research team and one of the mini-projects supported by Transforming Musicology, 'In Concert', which in turn was a collaboration between a data scientist (Alan Dix) and musicologists and music librarians working on historical concert programmes as documentary evidence for music history.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c93925ea76d1.28411618</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.transforming-musicology.org/dlfm2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DMRN Dec 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CDBF54F-DC24-4E02-B217-FBCC08BE72B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DMRN aims to promote research in the area of Digital Music, by bringing together researchers from UK universities and industry in electronic engineering, computer science, and music.

? We have published Linked Data on people and places in ECOLM and EMO which have direct utility for the music-library community (non-academic).
? We have involved members of the London Wagner Society (non-academic) in psychological testing of people's ability to recognise Wagnerian leitmotives; they came out very well ahead of all other musicians and non-musicians, demonstrating that familiarity with the music is the most important predictor of success in this task
? In November 2014 we participated in the Festival of the Humanities, 'Being Human', with a series of experiments to capture audience responses to Wagner's 'Ring' Cycle of four operas (15 hours of music) and a public event at the Birmingham Hippodrome. This received media attention, including a spot on Radio 4's Today programme. (We were given extra funding to carry out this work, which was not part of our original project proposal, but arose directly out of our research). The experiment involved 10 music students from the Birmingham Conservatoire, and has been replicated in a further experiment with Goldsmiths students watching a DVD of Pierre Boulez's famous Bayreuth performances from the 1970s. 
? On 13-14 December 2014 RA Ben Fields was involved with organising the Music Hack Days in London; this involves mostly non-academic developers of music software, most of whom work within the music industry.
? We have developed a generic semantic data alignment tool (SALT) which will enable non-academic library cataloguers, broadcasters and other media curators to take advantage of the latest technology in their work. This was demonstrated to the BBC Research &amp;amp; Development team on 15 October 2015, and aroused a good deal of interest.
? On 9 October 2015 we organised a small 'Hackathon' at Goldsmiths with additional funding from the parallel SLoBR project (OeRC, PI: Kevin Page); this was attended mostly by non-academic music developers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2339A2D6-73A7-4C8C-A695-63A9B90E3F68</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dec25f2bca51.76120689</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Despite the possibly slightly misleading title of the project, which could be taken to imply that we - the project - intended to 'transform' musicology, we have been very pleased to observe a generally positive reception from our peers in the discipline. The main aim was to explore some of the various ways in which musicology could catch up with the transformation in music distribution and practice that has resulted from the 'digital revolution' of that past three decades. We have carried out this exploration principally in three research 'strands': early printed vocal and instrumental music; Wagner's use of leitmotivs; musicology of social media.

In the first of these strands, we have applied techniques of music and text information retrieval (using algorithms developed by us and former colleagues in related projects) to investigate how instrumental arrangements in the 16th century were done and disseminated. We tracked the use of certain ornamental clich&amp;eacute;s in lute arrangements of both sacred and secular music, and were able to show that they were treated slightly differently. We also carried out preliminary research into 'playability' of music (such as that for the lute) which is notated in tablature, as this is specific to a particular instrument, yet has not been very much investigated in traditional musicology. This has led to a successful Follow-On Funding bid for &amp;quot;Learn To Play: Computational Assessment of Musical Playability for Users' Practice&amp;quot; in which we have teamed up with an industrial partner (Tido Music, a subsidiary of Peters Edition) to produce a proof-of-concept demonstrator for a program which will automatically 'grade' a collection of music, will indicate the most difficult passage within a selected piece, and on request will generate a set of practice exercises based on a selection within a piece. 
The work on Wagner's compositional methods, especially his use of leitmotivs, has led to a substantial chapter, which will appear in our forthcoming multimedia project publication, by Prof Laurence Dreyfus, provisionally entitled: 'Asking the forbidden question: Lohengrin's thematic network and Wagner's paradigmatic project'. This combines written text, music score examples and audio recorded examples in an entirely novel way enabled by the semantic infrastructural work we have done within the project. Prof Dreyfus's DPhil student at Oxford, Carolin Rindfleisch, has developed an innovative resource for the historical study of the leitmotiv concept over the period from Wagner's own writings to the present, including a comprehensive ontology for the annotation of documents such as leitmotiv guides.
The third strand, Musicology of Social Media, has involved research into contemporary popular music as discussed on the 'Genius' web-site by large numbers of enthusiastic online contributors. The main findings concern the ways in which contributors 'cluster' around particular artists and genres. The establishment and recognition of genre as a musical feature and the limitations of the 'standard', commercially-driven interpretations of the concept are addressed in the PhD work of our second project student, Justin Gagen, at Goldsmiths.

Further work, at Queen Mary University, has involved the redeployment and further development of The Harmonic Visualiser, a software program which can extract musical features for individual voices/instruments from an audio track in order to allow their manipulation or analysis. The QM team also worked on a novel method for extracting so-called 'chroma' features which can be used for audio-based music information retrieval. A PhD student at QM, Nicholas Harley, is working on a theoretical model for the mid-level representation of music so as to allow semantic interoperability between scores and audio recordings; this has been implemented as software and presented at several conferences.

A series of four mini-projects funded from the main grant have been managed by Dr Alan Marsden at Lancaster University. These have carried out ground-breaking work on: historical and contemporary electronic music (Dr Nick Collins, Durham); folk music of Ireland (Dr M&amp;uuml;nevver K&amp;ouml;k&amp;uuml;er, Birmingham City University); Medieval Latin lyrics for the sacred song-form known as conductus; historical concert programmes and other musical ephemera (Prof Rachel Cowgill, Huddersfield University).

Binding all these activities together, and enabling otherwise impossible or unwieldy interactions between them, is the semantic infrastructure developed by the T-Mus team at the Oxford eResearch Centre. This has developed useful sets of ontologies, and specialised software, for the provision, maintenance and exploitation of Linked Data within musicology; not only musical data itself, but also the workflows of research in the field and the verbal discourse around the discipline. This entirely novel application of technologies pioneered within the sciences is of great potential in the pursuit of humanities research in general, since the resources explored by musicologists cover almost every conceivable data type and format.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are probably too many ways to encapsulate here, but the principal ones are probably around future research in related areas, such as musicology (historical and analytical) or music information retrieval.

Additionally it is capable of measuring certain features in the collection of partials, such as vibrato. From there it can parameterise these and perform complex signal processing on them, such as removing the vibrato in a note or pasting in a different vibrato pattern. It has been developed over several years under a variety of funding.</gtr:description><gtr:id>530AC95C-DE53-44D1-89A0-1923396E0D52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has been used is several projects local to Queen Mary and within Goldsmiths.

This tool was developed to generate Fibonacci numbers and reduce them with clock arithmetic, generating a periodic sequence which is then mapped to notes, and the music explored by selecting fragments to play (Lagrange noted periodic functions in Fibonacci numbers in 1774, and the period is known as the Pisano period). Additional algorithms have been added to stimulate discussion of mathematical calculations on the Analytical Engine, contemplating what Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage might have done if the engine had been built.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4E700ADC-23F3-4DF6-A8EC-3E9D47649919</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It has been used to support a variety of engagement events.

Ada Lovelace's significant contributions were celebrated and discussed at the Ada Lovelace Symposium marking the bicentennial of her birth on 10th December 1815

On 30th November 2015 we explored mathematics, computation, and music through a performance of &amp;quot;Ada sketches&amp;quot;, a short operatic work by composed by Emily Howard and part of her Lovelace Trilogy. More than a performance, this event with Emily Howard and musicians from the Royal Northern College of Music involved mathematical explanation and engaged the audience in composition, turning numbers into notes. We revisited this work at the Ada Lovelace Symposium through an interactive display and a conversation on stage between David De Roure and Emily Howard, herself a mathematician, computer scientist and musician. This also featured an extract of Howard's work &amp;quot;Mesmerism&amp;quot;, another part of the Trilogy, and illustrated numbers and notes by generating a number sequence on a simulator of the Analytical Engine and developing the output as a musical theme-an exercise inspired by discussions at a music hack day held at Goldsmiths in October 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c94304e08611.80230544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Numbers into Notes web application</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/news/ada</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>PyRG retrieves data from the genius.com site which is then analysed using graph methods in order to find out properties of the networks within the genius.com site.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0B5CC57E-F5DA-47CA-BA78-CAB61A778988</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8c838ff0b4.17926505</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>genius.com Scraper</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/gearmonkey/pyrg</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>It is a semantic alignment and linking tool supporting the bridging and combined access of diverse sets of linked data.
