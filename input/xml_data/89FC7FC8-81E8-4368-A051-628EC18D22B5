Modern imaging studies have shown that there are hormone dependent effects on both the structure and functioning of the brain, which might explain these effects of hormones on behaviour in both humans and animals. While some of these hormone induced differences may start very early in life, including prior to birth, it has also been suggested that the changes in reproductive hormones at puberty may lead to alterations in the structure of the brain and its cells that could be responsible for differences in social behaviour and the way we process information as adults. Consequently, any changes in the pattern of hormones experienced at puberty (either naturally or as a result of medical interventions or exposure to chemicals in our environment) may affect normal brain development. In this regard, it is worthy of note that there are known changes in behaviour as humans and animals go through the pubertal transition, such as increased risk taking and there are a variety of clinical conditions associated with altered brain function such as schizophrenia, eating- and obsessive compulsive-disorders, which often become apparent at puberty. Using the sheep as an animal model, this project will tease apart the effects of changes in reproductive hormones on male brain development and whether the peripubertal period represents a critical period of normal brain development. This will be done by blocking the pubertal transition in male sheep using a drug treatment currently used to block puberty in human patients for a variety of medical conditions including growth retardation and early onset gender identity disorder. We will do this by either delaying puberty or differentiating the effects of GnRH (a hormone produced in the brain that drives activity within the reproductive system) and gonadal steroids, by replacing testosterone in animals in which activity within the reproductive axis was stopped by blocking the effects of GnRH. This work is of significance as the medical blockade of puberty is widely used in the treatment of a variety of conditions in human medicine, including growth deficiency and gender dysphoria. If the pubertal changes in reproductive hormones indeed play a crucial role in the maturation of the adolescent brain, the cognitive and/or reproductive functions of patients receiving this treatment may be permanently affected. This work also has the potential to inform us about changes in cognitive function that occur as we age and may contribute to the risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, as these changes also occur when the levels of reproductive hormones in the body change as reproductive function declines. This project will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the interaction between endocrine factors and the neural changes that occur in association with activation and senescence within the reproductive system. Achieving these objectives may direct intervention strategies that can be used in the treatment of neurocognitive conditions, the incidence/risk of which increases at puberty, such as obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia and with ageing e.g. Alzheimer's disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>It has long been recognised that behaviour and cognitive function are influenced by reproductive state and differ between the sexes as a consequence of differential steroid exposure. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods have allowed identification of differences in brain structures that may underlie such sexual dimorphisms. Recently, GnRH receptor expression has been documented in extra-hypothalamic areas (e.g. the hippocampus), providing a possible link between puberty and sex differences in behaviour and cognition. Classically, sexual differentiation of the brain is thought to occur following prenatal exposure to gonadal steroids. However, profound neuronal development also occurs during adolescence. While puberty is characterised by marked hormonal changes, little is known about the influence of pubertal hormones on the organisation of neural networks, behaviour and cognitive ability. This study will temporally delay puberty using a GnRH agonist treated ovine model and examine effects of dissociation of pubertal hormone changes and developmental age, on behaviour, cognitive function, neuroendocrine systems and neuronal architecture in the hypothalamus and non-endocrine brain regions. Real-time rtPCR, in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical methods will be used to investigate steroid receptor expression and neurotransmitter systems in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. As steroids (including locally produced neural oestrogen) can have a profound influence on neuronal plasticity, synaptic density and dendritic spine morphology will be investigated in the hippocampus and amygdala using immunohistological, biochemical and electron microscopy techniques. The study will elucidate long-term effects of pharmacological blocking, or significantly delaying, puberty and will inform us relative to endocrine causes of neuropathological conditions seen upon reaching adulthood and following reproductive senescence.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Who will benefit from the research? The research that is proposed in this grant application aims to understand the consequences and fundamental mechanisms by which peripubertal exposure to a GnRH agonist alters brain function and impacts on cognition and behaviour. Those who will benefit are patients who are currently treated in the medium or long term with such agonists, including patients with steroid stimulated benign or malignant tumours, those with growth deficiency and gender identity disorder. As GnRH receptors are also found in non reproduction controlling areas of the brain and in other peripheral tissues the research has potential to impact on other conditions which manifest themselves at times of change in GnRH secretion; at puberty and as reproductive function declines. These conditions include, seriously debilitating and potentially life limiting neurocognitive illnesses like schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and dementias. In addition health professionals will benefit from a better understanding of the consequences of giving GnRH agonists to their clients. Specialised drug companies may better understand the pharmacological effects of their products, be able to better target drug their development programmes for increased safety profiles and wealth creation. Policy makers will be better informed to make key financial and strategic decisions. The general public will be made more aware of the impact of substances in their environment that can affect their health and wellbeing in later life. This may impact on lifestyle choices for the benefit of the individual and dependents. Students and researchers will gain from training in the area of neuroscience and reproductive and behavioural science and the University will gain from employment for technical and administrative staff. 
2) How will they benefit? The patients will benefit from a better informed health, pharmaceutical and health policy sectors and their treatment can be better tailored to their needs. This will have knock on effects for family and carers and increase the general wellbeing of subsections of society. Scientists, especially those researching brain function and how is may be altered during key developmental windows, will expand these areas of research and train and employ others in their endeavours. Other benefits have been outlined in the previous section.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>559070</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Research and Development AstraZeneca</gtr:department><gtr:description>Gambol</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DEA70E6-9FDB-4DB3-8BE2-6392E4BE16EE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration began before the current BBSRC grant but directly led to that grant application.

This was an immersive theatre event for 12-15yr olds. The children when they arrive were told that they are scientists in training to work for the Department for the Investigation of Amorous disorders, its 1981, and they are in AbronHill High school where there seems to be a large amount of flirtatious behaviour occurring. 
The 'scientists' gatheedr in the assembly hall where a group of pupils are dancing to Don't you want me Baby by the Human League, a series of scenes occur between the pupils and the head teacher (linked to the film, Gregory's girl) which would suggest that amorous behaviour is rife. The 'scientists' are told that to complete their training they will be working with Psychologist and Endocrinologists to try and understand what is happening with the pupils of Abronhill High school. 
Psychology Workshop is set in a dark room in which photographs are being processed. There are photos of men and women strung along lines across the room above drip trays below.
Learning Objective 
To understand some of the key psychological factors that contribute to human attraction
This is achieved through vignettes (photographer and journalist) and interactive activities related to physical attractiveness, how physical responses influence how we perceive other people and familiarity. The session is facilitated by the scientists. 
Hormone/Neurotransmitter Workshop Outline set in a Home Economics classroom. At the tables around the room, there are students in the middle of a baking lesson. They have bowls and are mixingflour with cocoa powder and water. 
The scientists introduce themselves and their areas of research, hence why they are helping train the scientists for working in DIAD. 
Learning Objective: 
To examine the different theories of how hormones and neurotransmitters affect human behaviour with regard to attraction
This was achieved by observations of student behaviour through vignettes from 5 pupils of Abronhill High school, followed by group discussions about a theory of how hormones/NTs influence human attraction followed by short presentation on this to the whole workshop. This was then followed by a whole group discussion/vote on which theory they think most likely to be correct and why (citing observations made during the day) so recommendations could be made to DIAD</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56a0b3ed5fcfc0.95692433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cinelive.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Careers in science talk in Singapore</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26F8A164-8B6C-4F66-A9CE-2C36FBA54548</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to Diploma students in NgeeAnn Polytechnic about careers in science and showcasing the research we do in the lab.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56a0fa5b554b39.87437057</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Glasgow Paediatrics Research day, Oral and Poster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8667EB3D-61E4-4B4B-A7CA-5435CB8F0852</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation (Denise Hough): Long-term spatial memory is irreversibly impaired when delaying pubertal onset with GnRHa (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist): studies using a sheep model.

The receptors for GnRH however are also expressed in non-reproductive tissues, including areas of the brain. The impact of long-term GnRHa treatment on cognitive functions, such as spatial orientation and memory, is not well studied, particularly when treatment encompasses a critical window of development, such as puberty. We have shown, using an ovine model, that spatial orientation and short-term spatial memory improves with age and is not directly affected by peripubertal GnRHa treatment, but instead GnRH agonist treatment alters emotional reactivity and responsiveness to the effects of testosterone. The long-term retention of spatial memory was found to be impaired by peripubertal GnRHa treatment and this effect was attenuated with testosterone replacement therapy. These results demonstrate that GnRH signalling is involved in the retention of cognitive spatial information and that therapeutic medical treatments using chronic GnRHa may have effects on cognitive function. In a second study we found that cessation of GnRHa treatment when animals were 1 year of age which allowed them to go through a delayed puberty, long-term memory specifically the recall of long-term spatial information was still affected in the GnRHa-treated rams. This result suggests that the time at which puberty normally occurs may represent a critical period during brain development, specifically with regard to the retention of spatial information; however, this may also apply to other brain areas and aspects of cognitive function.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Two papers have recently been published and additional papers are in preparation</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5F49F90F-0D5B-45F6-809B-0DC165A72AEE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d45ab25869d9.51593791</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.researchgate.net/project/Effects-of-peripubertal-pharmacological-blockade-of-GnRH-action-on-neuronal-function-and-architecture</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution towards Endocrine society Guidelines for the treatment of Gender Dysphoria</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0D650D6E-8BB2-4117-A41D-93F1D53A0D03</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c913501d8010.62278339</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A new method was developed for steroid profiling, in various biological samples, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Denise Hough developed this method during her employment as postdoc on this BBSRC grant as part of her interest to look at the effects of peripubertal GnRHa in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The method allows simultaneous quantification of adrenal steroids, either from blood or wool samples. This method has been extended to include a selection of reproductive and neural steroids, as well as including a wider variety of biological sample type (e.g. various tissues or hair from different species). This method was developed in conjunction with Glasgow Polyomics Institute as they have the required LCMS equipment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84005205-A172-4E35-9282-0DCEDFC8E78D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This method is now available as a metabolomics service to internal/external groups (see URL link). It has been validated with various steroid extraction methods to cater for the needs of our research and others. It was used in this BBSRC grant to explore whether steroid profiles in hair/blood samples offer new insights into the effects of peripubertal GnRHa,
The method is also used to generate preliminary data for future grants for the quantification of neurosteroids.
This method has been used by Dr Grant Hopcraft to investigate steroid profiles (especially aldosterone, cortisol and progesterone) in wildebeest hair to look at time-related changes in metabolic profiles during the Serengeti migration.
Dr Valeria Marasco used this method to investigate steroid profiles (particularly progesterone, testoserone and corticosterone) in zebra finch eggs in relation to maternal stress.
A research group that is MRC funded used this method to quantify intra-tissue steroids in human fetal adrenal glands to investigate the effects of maternal smoking. This was the first study of its kind and this work has been submitted to the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism (impact factor 5.531) in which Denise Hough is a co-author. The grant holders are Prof Peter O'Shaugnessy (University of Glasgow), Dr Michelle Bellingham (University of Glasgow) and Prof Paul Fowler (University of Aberdeen) and the analyses was done by Ms Zoe Johnston in fulfilment of her PhD project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c14e87bd2735.53083755</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LCMS method development for steroid profiling in biological material</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/ms_metabolomics.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD589F67-0060-498C-AFE0-69F8954D89BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prenatal programming of neuroendocrine reproductive function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theriogenology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/209c4ff672ca3e529e0b75ef00c81b55"><gtr:id>209c4ff672ca3e529e0b75ef00c81b55</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans NP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0093-691X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d36c8c9d711.18451758</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>47D281E1-93B6-4B24-85C3-E5D0D852214F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A reduction in long-term spatial memory persists after discontinuation of peripubertal GnRH agonist treatment in sheep.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychoneuroendocrinology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5065f009cd81c69795e6e0e395b7deb3"><gtr:id>5065f009cd81c69795e6e0e395b7deb3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hough D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0306-4530</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>588b6333e9d0f9.17580832</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43D140DA-8E1A-4C6B-B847-BB709F078EE7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of inhibition of gonadotropin releasing hormone secretion on the response to novel objects in young male and female sheep.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychoneuroendocrinology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b7aeb2c61719a2d9f79bc1669fed3da"><gtr:id>0b7aeb2c61719a2d9f79bc1669fed3da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robinson JE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0306-4530</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5447d2aa0bbf63.98885467</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F25B9A81-41EA-48AB-B3BF-0DA4F6630EA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of peripubertal gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on brain development in sheep--a magnetic resonance imaging study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychoneuroendocrinology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6d063f55f4c68f7e7dfb3a08282fb2c2"><gtr:id>6d063f55f4c68f7e7dfb3a08282fb2c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sex On Brain European Research Group -
