Road and rail provide transport, pipelines carry energy and water, and cables transmit and distribute power and communications. Some of these networks are over 100 years old, while others involve brand new technology, but all of them have potential weaknesses to environmental hazards. Several recent network failures caused by such natural hazards have provided a sharp wake up call. Examples include the Dawlish railway collapse due to storms in 2014, damage to homes, bridges and roads in Cumbria in 2014/15, and flooding in Somerset leading to widespread loss of power in 2013/14. These events had profound impacts on people's lives, as well as large costs (&amp;gt;&amp;pound;Ms) to the local and UK economy. Such events may become more likely and more intense as the world continues to warm. In extreme cases, environmental hazards can have global implications. The 2010 Eyjafjallaj&amp;ouml;kull eruption in Iceland, for example, caused worldwide disruptions to air traffic, yet prior to its occurrence the effects of ash on aircraft engines had not been considered a major risk. 

Thus, there is a need to better understand the risk posed by environmental hazards to infrastructure. This is particularly important as we experience changes in our climate, as new technology is developed, new areas are explored, and populations grow. This fellowship aims to help address this risk through identifying gaps in our knowledge and assessing how future research can fill them. Importantly, this fellowship is supported by several industry organisations that are directly involved in assessing the risk posed by natural hazards to a wide range of infrastructure. The proposed work will involve time spent with those specialists, to understand the potential impacts, lessons learned, and how ongoing and future research can make real changes and improvements to assessing envonmental risk. 

First, the fellowship will determine whether industry has missed any key hazards, such as the Icelandic ash cloud and its impact on air travel. An inventory of potential hazards will be compiled and assessed by a joint academic and industry panel. This may include new hazards such as the breakage of subsea communication cables by underwater avalanches of sediment ('turbidity currents'). Such cables transport 99% of the world's communications including important financial data and the internet. 

Extreme events are difficult to predict as we have not typically experienced many (if any) since accurate records have been kept. Despite this, they can be the most damaging events. The fellowship will explore different techniques and tools for predicting and assessing extreme hazards such as developing new statistical methods that are more often used in medicine or financial studies. Such tools will need to include the effects of future climate change. 

Often, individual large events may not damage infrastructure, but the combined or successive effect of smaller natural hazards may be catastrophic. Here, it is proposed to summarise the lessons learned from a number of infrastructure owners, consultants and contractors to understand how we can better understand compound or cumulative impacts, and how that can inform the development of models in future.

In the same way as you go to the doctor to get a health check, it is important to understand the health of infrastructure. Historically this has been done by in-person inspections, but step changes in technology now enable remote and real-time monitoring. New technologies that can be used to monitor natural hazards and their impact on infrastructure will be summarised. Groups of researchers and industry representatives will be paired up to see how we can define best practice for industry in real-time monitoring of environmental hazards and increase cost-effectiveness of such efforts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236543</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ENI SpA</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Turbidity current monitoring joint industry project</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE0929FB-D4FC-4566-86FA-A1775762E6FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Technical workshops held with industry partners to develop scope for fieldwork and data analyses phases.

Initially, this has focussed on marine geohazards, using novel autonomous and moored equipment. Knowledge transfer has increased the capabilities of a number of companies that are keen to measure the forces applied by seafloor geohazards to improve their impact models. The initial phase of this fellowship has led to several organisations developing plans to make such measurements. Within this fellowship it is expected that these results will come online and will be shared so that informed decisions can be made about infrastructure routes, design and future measurement campaigns. This should reduce the risk uncertainty and contribute to more efficient design.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5EEFB1B6-BB2A-4CE9-9DAE-0BD5F0D3B4D0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58b4157adc1286.67762026</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Multi-hazards&amp;quot; is an emerging but important field for infrastructure industries that requires significant future research and industry efforts. Most organisations do not have a formal definition, but a common description was generally in line with: Multiple hazards occurring within a time window and/or space that generate an impact that is different (often amplify, but may reduce or modify in some way) to that of the individual hazards in isolation, through one or more of the following mechanisms:
i) Interact with each other to change the impact 
ii) Change the background conditions thus changing the likelihood or severity of subsequent hazards
iii) Interact with the infrastructure network at different points or times which may change the resilience/flexibility of the network.

The extent to which ERIIP members currently deal with multihazards (or not at all) varies, largely due to i) maturity of infrastructure; ii) regulatory requirements; and iii) previous experience of multi-hazard events. 

A number of common questions were raised by the industry members canvassed (which were presented in a think piece to the ERIIP panel)

i. What combinations of hazards are a concern? (e.g. have a disproportionate impact) Identification and characterisation of credible multi-hazard scenarios based on academic experience would be valuable as it is not feasible to assess all combinations of all hazards
ii. How do hazards interact? Physical process models are needed that quantify the nature and result of hazard interactions and identify &amp;quot;tipping points&amp;quot;, rather than considering hazards in isolation
iii. Where and how are networks affected? Visualisation of multi-hazard scenarios useful to identify infrastructure pinchpoints/hotspots/critical zones
iv. What is the cost of the impact? Fully integrated model(s) needed to link physical process to economic analysis (both direct and indirect impacts) 
v. How can you quantify the uncertainty for multi-hazard scenarios? Quantification is needed for dealing with uncertainty for multi-hazard scenarios, but how do you make reasonable estimates with the likelihood of two or more unconnected events?
vi. How do we communicate multi-hazard events (in particular likelihood)? Traditional approaches such as characteristic interval/return period are unlikely to be appropriate (particularly for unlinked coincident hazard events). 
vii. How will likelihood and severity change in future? What are the implications of climate change on multi-hazard scenarios?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is a plan for a co-designed ERIIP funding call.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>11F31D1A-9A24-40F5-9F3B-D01F94221042</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b417075f1979.90622697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Guidance on measuring geohazards in deep water</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D92134A0-C018-40E5-AA4E-5088BDE022C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guidance has been provided to Chevron, ENI and Fugro on how to make measurements of geohazards in deep-water.
