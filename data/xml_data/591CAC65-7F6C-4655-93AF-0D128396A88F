Many offenders who have served spells in prison go on to re-offend when they are re-introduced into local communities, increasing the risk of victimisation against those who reside in these and neighbouring communities. However, little is known in the UK about whether the geographic characteristics of the area where the offender is re-introduced has an impact on the level of re-offending that is committed.

&lt;p>Whilst little research has been conducted in the UK on this topic, a growing evidence-base has been developed in the USA over the last 6 years.This project aims to review and synthesise this and other research to identify to what level geographic characteristics of areas play a role in the risks of re-offending, after release from prison.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project also involves exploring the utility of a dataset on offenders and re-offending that has been composed by Crime Reduction Initiatives and the practicalities of implementing the research findings by discussing these with offender management agencies from the Greater Manchester region.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11415</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The results of our research have highlighted the need for the location where an offender resides following their release from prison to be considered in the assessments that are carried out on their risk of re-offending. On release from prison, the Probation Service (or Youth Offending Service if the offender is below the age of 18) conduct an assessment of the person's risk of re-conviction. The assessment considers what are seen to be the key factors that may influence their offending, such as use of drugs, alcohol misuse, lack of suitable accommodation, employment, education and training, and the influence of family or peers. At present it does not consider where they reside. Our research has highlighted to the Integrated Offender Management teams that we visited that this is a very important factor. While there is little choice in deciding where an offender resides post release (i.e. it is not possible to re-introduce them to a location of choice, as determined by the IOM, that can minimise their offending behaviour), a consideration of this location is now recognised by these IOMs as an important factor. At present, the Probation Service risk assessment system (OASys) does not easily allow for the entry of the location of re-introduction to be included in the assessment of re-offending risk. However, the research has highlighted the possibility of conducting other supporting analysis that can rank areas in relation to the contribution it may play in an offender's risk of re-offending.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E45D03D2-0736-4C1F-A49E-10D1E785C369</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a337b023907.67627447</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Prolific offenders contribute to a disproportionate volume of crime.

This project involved a synthesis of the existing research into prisoner re-introduction and re-offending. The majority of this growing evidence-base has been developed in the USA. This research has shown that where an offender resides following their release from prison does matter; if it is a place of familiarity then the offender has awareness of the opportunities to commit crime - a key factor in the risk of re-offending. This can be compounded by geographical characteristics of the area (e.g. a burglar being re-introduced in a target rich student housing area); however, this needs to be balanced with the positive role that family ties (most usually in places that are familiar to the offender) can have on reducing the risk of re-offending. We visited the Integrated Offender Management Teams in Oldham, Stockport and Newcastle to discuss the findings from this research and its practical implications. Often the difficulty is that there is limited choice in where offenders can reside following their release from prison, but that a weakness in the current process is that no consideration is given on where they are re-introduced in the assessment of whether they will re-offend.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The risk assessments carried out by Probation and Corrections services should consider the location of where the offender resides (immediately following their release from prison) in their calculated assessment of their risk of re-offending.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>271FAEB9-DBDF-44F6-A040-D13F7B697971</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-313408812.7998717477811246</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4BEC5996-293F-4DCE-B415-FB542E313B3C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Integrating Environmental Considerations into Prisoner Risk Assessments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Probation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fe1b95ffd8172be848ad9a50d842ebf3"><gtr:id>fe1b95ffd8172be848ad9a50d842ebf3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tompson L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544a296f672e42.35841361</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-193-25-0012</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-193-25-0012</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
