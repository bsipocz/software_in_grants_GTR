The empirical focus will be Greek, and in particular the phenomenon of case, i.e. the morphological expression of syntactic roles such as subject and object (see the contrast between the subject and the object in an English sentence like &amp;quot;He saw him&amp;quot;). This investigation will achieve its breadth by looking into case across 2800 years of history of Greek but it also aims to have depth, by focusing on one language system and looking into the interrelation of case with other linguistic phenomena within the system of one language. Theoretically, the project is couched within the theoretical framework of Principles and Parameters (Chomsky 1957) that has been focusing on two questions:
(a) What are the universal principles of language; shared by all languages and therefore inherent in the human brain?
(b) Which properties are language-specific; contributing to differences in the way languages look and therefore prone to variation?
Case and its link to formal syntax has been at the forefront of linguistic theorizing exactly because it has both universal and language-specific properties. On the one hand, case morphology is not found in all languages and even in the languages that have it exhibits fascinating cross-linguistic variation that seems to resist any universal characterization; on the other hand however, mainstream linguistic theory has tried to argue for a deeper link between the case form of a noun and its syntactic role in a sentence, namely that case morphology in a way &amp;quot;licenses&amp;quot; the presence of a nominal in a clause and specific case values (nominative, accusative etc.) are linked to different roles (subject, object etc.). The relationship between cases and syntactic roles however is clearly not 'one-to-one' and recently there have been attempts to reconfigure the place of case in grammar and treat it as a parameter, a point of variation among languages (Baker 2015). Such an approach is both novel and theoretically significant because it uses the notion of parameters, to account for the cross-linguistic variation in the domain of case realization. We aim to test the validity of this proposal by focusing on datives and genitives, two cases whose nature has been notoriously hard to pin down. To investigate datives and genitives, we focus on two phenomena where the simple 'one-to-one' view between roles and cases breaks down entirely: dative and genitive objects of monotransitive and ditransitive predicates, and environments where datives are considered &amp;quot;quirky&amp;quot; subjects, arguments of &amp;quot;impersonal&amp;quot; verbs like 'seems' that also coexist with nominatives. We will look into the diachrony of these environments because crucially:
(a) morphological dative case has been lost from the history of Greek;
(b) in the recent history of Greek, there has been a split in the morphological realization of indirect objects, between Standard Modern Greek and Northern Greek. 
The methods that we will employ to address the research questions are two-fold: (a) collecting data from a corpus of representative texts from Homer to Modern Greek; (b) collecting novel data from Northern Greek focusing on the behaviour of non-theme objects of both mono and ditransitives in relation to passivization.
The deliverables of this project will include academic publications but also an online searchable and annotated treebank, to be used freely by any researcher interested in case or Greek, and also a project website. The impact of this research will be showcased through (a) videos on the benefits of bi-dilectalism and the threat of language death; (b) videos about the history of the Greek language; (d) videos about the relevance of theoretical linguistic research in language teaching; (e) two teaching plans for teaching the category of case to different types of second language learners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project is a theoretical project that will investigate the universal and language-particular aspects of case over the course of the history of Greek. While the heart of the project lies within theoretical and historical linguistics there is discernable impact of this research outside academia. In particular there are the following aspects of the impact of our research:
(i) A better understanding of the history of the Greek language that will inform lexicographers, grammarians and translators;
(ii) Our focus on the dialects of Greek will inform the public and aim to challenge typical perspectives of non-standard varieties as somewhat inferior to the standard variety;
(iii) Finally, given that the heart of our project is the investigation of linguistic variation, we will aim to inform the educational sector in ways of teaching the phenomenon of case to two kinds of native speakers: those whose first language does have overt case morphology and to those whose first language doesn't. 
In order to achieve this impact the project will have to design non-academic dissemination tools and it will do so in the forms of the project website and the short videos and teaching plans that will be hosted there. 
The discipline of linguistics has a duty to disseminate its findings to the wider audience and also inform language teaching and other fields that touch upon language and its structure. 
Regarding the first type of proposed impact, lexicographers, grammarians and translators will benefit in a number of ways from the proposed project. Historical linguistic research done with sharper theoretical tools is able to pinpoint language change in a very precise manner. Our research will not only look into a large number of texts but we will also compile an annotated corpus that can be used by grammarians, lexicographers and translators as well. The use of accurate examples is crucial for these disciplines and the corpus, in all its morphological and syntactic detail, will be able to inform them as well. 
Public attitudes to non-standard dialects, in addition to the overwhelming prescriptivism found in language teaching, have been decidedly negative even in recent years when linguistic research has clear arguments to the contrary. Linguistic research on language variation (see among many others the seminal works of Labov (1972) on African-American English, Henry (1995) on Belfast English and Sitaridou (2014a,b) on Romeyka) has shown repeatedly and decisively that a non-standard variety is by no means &amp;quot;less&amp;quot; of a language than the standard variety. The division between the two, often regarded as an arbitrary and political decision, has nothing to do with merit, and linguistic research has shown that non-standard varieties have linguistic rules much in the same way standard varieties do. However, the aforementioned negative public attitudes and of course the lack of any educational provision in non-standard varieties often leads to language death. The information and videos hosted at the project website aim to inform the public of the benefits of speaking more than one linguistic variety, benefits quite similar to those of multilingualism and therefore alleviate the negative attitudes associated with speaking a non-standard dialect. 
Finally, the project aims at informing the education sector on the ways different phenomena can be taught to people with distinct first languages. It is well known that teaching methods can vary drawing on the properties of the first language. This project aims at developing two teaching plans both for teaching the category of case to second language learners: the first plan would be for English speakers whose language has little or no case morphology, and the second one would be for Greek speakers, whose language indeed has case morphology. These free resources, available for language teachers worldwide will ideally apply the insights from our research to the domain of language teaching.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006612/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7FE57A9-0C24-4DF0-8677-7EB2936B755F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Corpus Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>670B21EC-383C-4A51-856D-14A82FAE3EC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Variation &amp; Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>29000EBB-2E17-48B1-A0F8-87862EF36D2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistic Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF570B48-CCF2-4278-BD44-F58AD6C36BDA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Syntax</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
