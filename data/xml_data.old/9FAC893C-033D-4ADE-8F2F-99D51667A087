We believe that the next important stage in the development of computing will focus on optical platforms integrated on chip to perform low-power low-dissipation information storage, relaying and information processing, but requiring a quantum mechanical description of their dynamics, and their control.

The PI is an expert on quantum stochastic models based on the Hudson-Parthasarathy calculus, and has developed several key results in model reduction, synthesis and interconnection of quantum networks, and stochastic approximation techniques that are directly relevant to quantum optics. With Matthew James, the PI has pioneered the mathematical formalism of Quantum Feedback Networks for describing how component open quantum systems can be connected. This has recently been automated in a freely available visual programming and simulation implementation framework by researchers at MabuchiLab. The Quantum Feedback Network formalism lies at the heart of synthesis and design of quantum feedback control systems, and has been used to develop models of squeezing enhancement, autonomous quantum error correction schemes, optical switching devices, etc. At present, the MabuchiLab group are one of the main users of the theoretical framework developed by the PI. The aim of the visit is to identify the likely mathematical and conceptual problems that are currently arising. 

The early theoretical suggestions for quantum coherent feedback control were:

i) The MabuchiLab treatment of the optimal least disturbance problem for optical signals passed through a quantum cavity (an exemplar for robust quantum control techniques developed by Nurdin, James and Peteresen), 

ii) the Gough-Wildfeuer proposal to enhance the squeezing capability for degenerate parametric amplifiers (this was subsequently verified experimentally by the Tokyo group headed by Akira Furusawa, and a systems-theoretic improvement has been suggested by Zhang in Hong Kong based on the inclusion of active components). This proposal aims at drawing these strings together in an aligned way.

The quantum stochastic calculus has proved remarkably successful in modeling quantum optical systems, and rigorous limit results for these models, such as adiabatic elimination, are suggesting new strategies for engineering non-linear optical components, and the quantum feedback network framework has lead to an efficient technique leading directly to the master equation for compound quantum input-output systems. Coherent-feedback has been proposed as a mechanism for autonomous quantum memories, in particular, quantum-error correction schemes assembled from cavity QED devices linked through optical wave-guides could in principle work without external clocking or control. The goal of the visit is to explore likely areas of application for model abstraction using quantum stochastic analysis, with a view investigating the designability aspect of robustly controlled quantum systems. 

As a principal direction for long term research investigation we would like to look at applying model-based graphical techniques from network analysis to quantum feedback networks. The PI proposes to visit Stanford University this year for three weeks (the start will coincide with the 2013 Principles and Applications of Control to Quantum Systems meeting organized in Monterey, CA). We also wish to connect this with recent work by Dr Guofeng Zhang in Hong Kong on control theoretic aspect of the Gough-Wildfeuer problem were a quantum mechanical dynamic compensator is included for robustness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the very likely near term directions in high performance computer design is the development of low-power optical components to relay and
perform information processing. Here the goal is to exploit the small heat dissipation of optical systems, however, the regime of operation will typically be at the level of few photon number and will require a fully quantum mechanical description. While the information processing will be essentially classical, the hardware will be quantum, and from an engineering perspective this requires use to use specific control techniques dedicated to quantum systems. The expected beneficiaries in the medium term will be manufacturers of high performance computers who are aiming at photonic circuit layers to relay information between processing cores in chips and to perform information processing with optical devices where quantum fluctuations are important. 

There is an annual global investment of approximately $4.2 billion in Nano-technology. Our project is aimed at future applications when quantum control becomes the modus operandi of nanotech engineering.

The outcomes of the project will enable future quantum technologies, and should form the basis for commercial opportunities, particularly in high performance quantum communications. These are applications that will be &amp;quot;technologically disruptive'', that is, rendering current technologies obsolete.

We believe that it is vital that the UK keep apace internationally with countries who are investing heavily in this area, particularly, the United States, Australia and Japan. This will have a long term benefit for the UK economy, and allow us to compete internationally in a field that is widely believed to be of fundamental technological importance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant was for scientific travel. I have gone to the PRACQSYS (Principles and Applications of Control to Quantum Systems) 2013 meeting in Monterey, and used the opportunity to visit Irfan Siddiqi's group at Berkeley, and Hideo Mabuchi and Jelena Vukovic in Stanford. These visits proved very constructive and have lead to 2 papers applying quantum coherent feedback control to quantum transport for the first time (these are accepted in Phys Rev A and Phys Rev E at the time of writing). Further work with Guofeng Zhang has been conducted: the PI has twice visited Hong Kong in 2014 (Jan/Feb and Nov/Dec) with Zhang visiting at the Isaac Newton Institute programme Quantum Control Engineering Jul/Aug 2014. Again a number of outputs have been submitted for publication following this.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CA8831F2-FFFD-48F9-BC49-60ABC27CE7EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5470160e19f453.08662173</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>First implementation of quantum coherent feedback to quantum transport models (with Clive Emary) and a general theory of quantum feedback networks for quantum transport phenomena</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Extending quantum feedback (both coherent and measurement-based) to quantum transport models.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>011D03AF-BA4E-4D48-BFAD-7AB98FB81694</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>547016e201ef79.86402041</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EB3DF222-4C3B-4EDE-90EF-5E9F0F835440</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coherent feedback control in quantum transport</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/903a75d22d6f6bedc5a4e875da273c44"><gtr:id>903a75d22d6f6bedc5a4e875da273c44</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Emary C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f337043d6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C1504DE-CCFE-450D-89BB-28B9E4E6A49A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Noether&amp;acirc;??s theorem for dissipative quantum dynamical semi-groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0cfdf1b71fc389f4a174d2241ec80e0f"><gtr:id>0cfdf1b71fc389f4a174d2241ec80e0f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gough J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f334162b3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D860E08C-27C0-477F-81FC-480BF9A0E26F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wigner measures and quantum control</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Doklady Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0cfdf1b71fc389f4a174d2241ec80e0f"><gtr:id>0cfdf1b71fc389f4a174d2241ec80e0f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gough J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f33864cda</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95EA7D96-F02F-4E1B-A184-1824C0786BE0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Feedback network models for quantum transport.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical review.
