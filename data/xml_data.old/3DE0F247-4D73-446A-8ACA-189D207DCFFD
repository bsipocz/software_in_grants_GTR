They carry out all of the functions that sustain life, from metabolism through replication to the exchange of information between a cell and its environment. They are coded for by a 'blueprint' in the form of the DNA sequence in the genome, which describes how to make them as linear strings of building blocks. In order to function, however, most macromolecules fold into a precise 3D structure, which in turn depends primarily on the sequence of building blocks from which they are made. Knowledge of the molecule's 3D structure allows us both to understand its function, and to design chemicals to interfere with it.

Due to advances in molecular biology, a number of projects, including the Human Genome Project, have led to the determination of the complete DNA sequences of many organisms, from which we can now read the linear blueprints for many macromolecules. As yet, however, the 3D structure cannot be predicted from knowledge of the sequence alone. One way to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; macromolecules, and so to determine their 3D structure, involves initially crystallising the molecule under investigation, and subsequently imaging it with suitable radiation. 

Macromolecules are too small to see with normal light, and so a different approach is required. With an optical microscope we cannot see objects which are smaller than the wavelength of light, roughly 1 millionth of a metre: Atoms are about 1000 times smaller than this. However X-rays have a wavelength about the same as the size of the atoms. For this reason, in order to resolve the atomic detail of macromolecular structure, we image them with X-rays rather than with visible light. The process of imaging the structures of macromolecules that have been crystallised is known as X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is like using a microscope to magnify objects that are too small to be seen with visible light. Unfortunately X-ray crystallography is complicated because, unlike a microscope, there is no lens system for X-rays and so additional information and complex computation are required to reconstruct the final image. This information may come from known protein structures using the Molecular Replacement (MR) method, or from other sources including Electron Microscopy (EM).

Once the structure is known, it is easier to pinpoint how macromolecules contribute to the living cellular machinery. Pharmaceutical research uses this as the basis for designing drugs to turn the molecules on or off when required. Drugs are designed to interact with the target molecule to either block or promote the chemical processes which they perform within the body. Other applications include protein engineering and carbohydrate engineering.

The aim of this project is to improve the key computational tools needed to extract a 3D structure from X-ray crystallography experiments. It will provide continuing support to a Collaborative Computing Project (CCP4 first established in 1979), which has become one of the leading sources of software for this task. The project will help efficient and effective use to be made of the synchrotrons that make the X-rays that are used in most crystallographic experiments. It will provide more powerful tools to allow users to exploit information from known protein structures when the match to the unknown structure is very poor. It will also automate the use of information from electron microscopy, even when the crystal structure has been distorted by the process of growing the protein crystal. Finally, it will allow structures to be solved, even when poor quality and very small crystals are obtained.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal incorporates five related work packages.

In WP1 we will track synchrotron-collected data through computational structure determination, to find whether the most useful data can be recognised a priori using established or novel metrics of data quality and consistency. We will then enable data collection software to communicate with pipelines and graphics programs to assess when sufficient data have been collected for a given scientific question, and so to prioritise further beamtime usage. We will also communicate extra information about diffraction data to structure determination programs, and so support the statistical models and algorithms being developed in WP4.

WP2 will improve the key MR step of model preparation, especially from diverged, NMR, or ab initio models. One development will be to extend the size limit of ab initio search model generation by exploiting sequence covariance algorithms.

In WP3 we will use our description of electron density maps as a field of control points to better use electron density or atomic models positioned by MR. Restrained manipulation of these points provides a low-order parameterisation of refinement decoupled from atomic models, and therefore suitable for highly diverged atomic models or EM-derived maps. We will extend this approach to characterise local protein mobility without the requirement of TLS for predefinition of rigid groups.

In WP4 we will statistically model non-idealities in experimental data, including non isomorphism, spot overlap, and radiation damage. The resulting models, implemented in REFMAC, will be applied to refinement using data that are annotated by WP1 tools and tracked by WP0.

WP0 will provide the tools to integrate the other WPs. For this, it will create a cloud environment where storage- and compute-resources can be utilised optimally, and where rich information can be passed among beamlines, pipelines, and graphics programs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The generic importance of macromolecular crystallography in general and CCP4 in particular is provided in the Pathways to Impacts section.

Macromolecular crystallography represents a mature field, where both experimental and computational techniques are expected to be mere instruments for obtaining atomic-scale images of biological macromolecules. A high level of instrumentation is reached at the data-production end, where modern X-ray installations, such as synchrotrons, produce high volumes of data in nearly automatic mode, and often allow researchers to conduct experiments remotely from their home labs. On computational side, high level of automation is achieved by combining many individual steps into sophisticated pipelines, which choose most appropriate structure solution pathway depending on the type of experiment, data quality and structure properties. As a result, over last decade, crystallographic software has grown considerably in size and complexity, which puts increasing maintenance burden on local support teams and researchers. In addition, advanced automation requires significant computation resources, not always available in small to medium size labs. A similar situation is observed in data management domain, where logistics is stressed by high volumes of data produced by both X-ray facilities and in the course of structure solution.

Successful accomplishment of WP0 will have the following impacts:

1) Cloud-based resource for macromolecular computations will allow to seamlessly bridge data production and structure solution, and also provide users with crystallographic software and computational resources as a service. This is expected to simplify data logistics significantly and decrease software, data and hardware maintenance burden on small to medium size research groups.

2) A particular impact will be observed in the simplicity of using automatic structure solution software, where most of computational resources are required. Cloud computing will make automatic structure solution possible with the use of virtually any ultra-portable devices. For most users today, crystallographic computations at home start from merged data sets, processed at synchrotron's beamline. In five year perspective, most users will have the option to start manual work from nearly complete structures, obtained in automatic way in the cloud, without the necessity of moving significant volumes of data between synchrotrons and home setups.

3) An additional impact will be seen in the possibility to archive experimental data and structure solution results, as well as complete track of structure solution process, in the cloud. This will allow for the possibility to re-examine experimental results retrospectively, which is not always possible today.

4) A significant impact will be seen in high homogeneity of computational setup and data accessibility for cloud users with multiple workplaces, for example, home lab, synchrotron, on a visit to a colleague, at a conference or personal residence. No data transfer and exporting/importing CCP4 cloud projects with possible compatibility problems will be ever required for switching between work sites.

5) HTML5-based development is likely to have a very long lifetime and backward compatibility due to the exceptional role of HTML format in the World Wide Web. This will have a substantial positive impact on maintenance burden and resources needed for future developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>407684</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Scientific Computing Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>CCP4-DaAS Collaboration on Computational Cloud Developments</gtr:description><gtr:id>0DBAA353-D401-4A34-8AA9-D66D7F492D4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) Set of technical specifications for computational Cloud infrastructure

Setting up a Cloud infrastructure for interactive scientific computations requires a careful examination of available technologies and matching those with specifics of the software the Cloud should support, typical usage patterns and the corresponding data logistics. As the initial stage of the Project, technical specifications for CCP4 Cloud setup have been developed in coordination with STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD). The Cloud will be represented by a system of virtual machines running CCP4 Software through the newly released CCP4 Graphical Interface version 2 (CCP4i2 in CCP4 release 7.0, January 2016), which provides all necessary job and data handling. Cloud virtual machines will be accessible through a common browser without the needs for client software to be installed locally. Therefore, CCP4 Cloud will be accessible on all internet-enabled devices, including mobile platforms. In difference of typical cloud setups, CCP4 Cloud will have a persistent storage for every registered user, where original data and intermediate steps of crystallographic computations will be stored. Second non-standard feature of CCP4 Cloud will be the ability to run computationally expensive jobs on a dedicated computational facility such as SCARF cluster at STFC/SCD. Finally, there will be data exchange between CCP4 Cloud and data producing facilities, such as beamlines at Diamond Light Source, as well as between local CCP4 setups (e.g. on individual laptops) and the Cloud.

According to specifications developed, a pilot project, supported by the collaboration with SCD, has started. The pilot will implement a Cloud prototype for 20 potential users with the aim to verify the basic principles and technical solutions taken, as well as to collect preliminary users' feedback. Currently we have a working set of Cloud virtual machines with CCP4i2 running on them, which is sufficient for performing computational tasks within virtual machines. A set of dedicated modules for running CPU-intensive jobs on SCARF facility at SCD is currently under development. Work in progress also includes the set up of the persistent user storage and CVMFS system for the centralised CCP4 software repository, accessible for Cloud virtual machines. Accomplishing these tasks will complete 1st stage of the pilot, making it available for preliminary testing and feedback by a chosen set of interested users. Further stages will include implementation of data exchange protocols between Diamond and CCP4 Cloud, development of Restful API for running CCP4 tasks in Cloud directly from data producing facilities and users desktops, seamless exchange of CCP4 projects between local and Cloud setups, scaling pilot to higher number of users and ultimately the full-scale deployment.

2017

The prototype of Cloud setup for CCP4, performed jointly by STFC Scientific Computing Department and CCP4, is in test mode. The viability of approach is proven, although further activity is required to verify its practical suitability for users and attractiveness for Diamond. A planned update of SCD Cloud is expected to result in higher interactivity of client machines, and a further estimate of available capacity will be required closer to the release point.

An alternative approach to providing Cloud services via a dedicated web-application was performed. Within this approach, a light-weight framework of computational servers communicating via ordinary http or https protocol is used to maintain distributed computations. The framework is sufficiently abstracted in respect to both content (data and task types it operates on) and hardware (the type and location of computational nodes), which makes it effectively a Cloud setup. Such a framework is useful in the context of collaborative computational projects as it allows for CPU crowd-sourcing: individual idling computers and clusters may be included in the setup at any point. The framework is now being developed and is expected to be released in 2018. The first release will contain all major CCP4 automatic structure solution pipelines, complemented with data import, export and analysis functions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>First release of CCP4 Cloud Pilot will be made available for testing and feedback to a chosen set of interested users from UK crystallographic community in 2016.

It provides an abstract framework to manage users data and run computational tasks on them. The framework is data-driven, so that a user gradually navigates from experimental data through a number of intermediate processes, generating derived data, to a final solution (such as protein structure) at the end. The framework supports user accounts and projects within them. Each project is developed graphically in any common browser, in a highly integrated and interactive manner. The data workflow is maintained automatically, by thus making it easy to inspect structure solution process retrospectively. Thanks to the multi-server architecture, the systems is easily scalable, and allows for crowd-sourcing, where computational resources may be acquired from any donating location. The system includes all main CCP4 automatic structure solvers as well as individual tasks (e.g. structure refinement) and provides both MR and EP routes for structure solution.

The framework consists of 3 types of http servers: front-end, number-cruncher and client-side, communicating exclusively via http or https protocols. The front-end server provides user accounting and, for each user, support for computational projects. Each project represents a branched tree of jobs, generally following the workflow of data in the project. The jobs are executed by the front-end on dedicated number-cruncher servers, which have their own system of job maintenance and storage clean-up. Finally, local clients provide user interface and communication between user and the front end. From user's point of view, the framework looks like a web-application, accessible via common browsers, with rich graphical input and output. Using the in-browser GUI, a user can import data in their projects, form new task and arrange them in form of branching tree, by this allowing for easy reconciliation of the computational routes. Since all projects and imported data are available to user from any geographic location via the Internet, the framework features a type of Cloud setup. From developer's point of view, the framework represents an abstract system of data and task types, complemented with operational links between them. New data and task types can be introduced without changes in the framework, by mere scripting in Javascript and Python. Neither user nor developer are supposed to know the actual configuration of the framework-based computational setup, which makes it extremely versatile and scalable. The framework may be used for hardware crowd-sourcing, thus allowing to utilise idling CPU resources in virtually any location, from a particular lab to computational centres. The framework is being prototyped for specific application in macromolecular crystallography, yet it is fully content-agnostic and may be used in any field where serial computations are required.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F69A677-9C5C-4FFB-B455-2594A8AD582E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hardware crowd-sourcing; Versatile cloud setups for distributed scientific computations; Uniform access to user's data and computational projects via Internet on virtually any type of client device (PC, tablet, smartphone); Consolidation of software services.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd75cb54bcd9.15381599</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Web-based framework for distributed computations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ccp4serv6.rc-harwell.ac.uk/jscofe/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BCA63BC0-00E3-47F2-86BF-BA4DDF2F2988</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distributed computing for macromolecular crystallography</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta Crystallographica Section D Structural Biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98022d5ddeb832d1f26ee5f698072dd3"><gtr:id>98022d5ddeb832d1f26ee5f698072dd3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Krissinel E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a981e400bc4f9.97401090</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L007037/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FA4A8455-3074-48A4-B0CD-5B85D94B79F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>eScience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
