&lt;p>The purpose of this project is threefold:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;to ?know?, in detail, what this model is so that those within the Partnership and those considering its adoption can understand it properly and identify the precise elements of the model and how it works in practice&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to help those who wish to assess the relevance and value of the model to understand the link between the model and performance outcomes (a link that is more complex that is usually recognised)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to reveal the potential (and limitations) for transferability of the model to other organisations in the public, private and third sectors of the economy.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The project involves extensive work within John Lewis and Waitrose followed by a series of case studies in other organisations which in varying degrees have sought to learn from and emulate the JLP model.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? The output of this project will be of direct use and value to a number of different bodies interested in the nature and relevance of the JLP model. Each will require a slightly different strategy to ensure the impact of the research. We will devise an impact strategy for each group of users. 

The most immediate group of users will be in the John Lewis Partnership (JLP) itself. This group - potentially extending across the 75,000 JLP employees - has, for this project, the lead interface of the directors and JLP senior managers with whom we are working in order to clarify the model. Many in this senior group play a key role in informing the public debate about the nature and relevance of the JLP model. This KE project has impact value in helping this influential group refine and clarify their accounts of the model. Hence, the research will be used by these managers for both their internal and external work. The Chairman has made clear his commitment to the project and has notified his colleagues it will contribute to internal discussions about the model and the approach to business strategic choices. We have agreed with him that we will present interim conclusions of our work to groups of senior JLP managers and attend workshops to discuss these materials. We will also produce articles on the research for the JLP in-house magazine, the Gazette, and offer presentations to the Chairman's Conference - an annual meeting of senior managers of JLP - and to the induction and other training/development events. We have agreed with the Managing Director of John Lewis to run a seminar on the research findings for the John Lewis Board.

The research report will also have a wider impact through discussions between JLP senior managers and a range of outside bodies interested in the JLP model. The research report will be used by JLP managers in the various bodies of which they are members, and furthermore we will offer to present our conclusions to these bodies. 

These bodies constitute a second category of user. They include all those institutions established to research, explore, and discuss, alternative organizational models, especially those specifically charged with addressing mutuals and cooperatives or other forms of employee ownership/participation. We will engage with these bodies and present the results of our investigations in meetings with them. They include, for example, the Mutual Pathfinders - an initiative launched by Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office which includes the John Lewis Partnership as one of the main mentors to the raft of organizations participating in this programme. One such is the Swindon Intermediate Care Centre - a service jointly commissioned by NHS Swindon and Swindon Borough Council. This is intended to lead the way for other public sector employees who want to take ownership of the services they provide. John Lewis Partnership is sharing its experience of employee ownership with this pathfinder to help it develop its plan to become a mutual. Our Knowledge Exchange project should help to deepen the interchange of ideas in this and similar cases. 

How will the impacts be felt? As noted above, the contribution of our work in this project is to provide independent and thorough assessment of the nature and the practical workings of the John Lewis approach. The intention therefore is to make a contribution - and thus achieve an impact - through dialogue with those individuals and organizations interested in exploring the realities and the possibilities of the model in other contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31758</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has helped to clarify the many different forms which 'mutuality' can take.

So, for example, the small community health mutuals which spun-off from the NHS proper face challenges around a limited customer-base and reliance on one or two major contracting clients. Or, take a different example, mutuals with both employee members and consumer members face distinct challenges.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AA092CF5-CCF8-449C-AFFC-C4740AD3F16D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544107dd35ee25.27122477</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6ADE0FB3-2F0D-4737-AA32-9EA2094EE910</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performance outcomes and behaviours in co-owned businesses</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>York co-ownership conference, University of York, March 2014.</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14acfdc052dddc851defc0b21ddeb1c3"><gtr:id>14acfdc052dddc851defc0b21ddeb1c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Storey, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5430286092eb71.12781418</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B59D54B7-2FAC-4223-B192-494D7382F96E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Managing and resisting 'degeneration' in employee-owned businesses: A comparative study of two large retailers in Spain and the United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organization</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/06c536426122298b838201a86566f7f2"><gtr:id>06c536426122298b838201a86566f7f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Storey J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_7462001804135aed90</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FA8B8AC-ADD3-49E3-92DF-BF96E3AC8347</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Better Way of Doing Business?: Lessons from The John Lewis Partnership</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c529f621b0051f392e84d83ddb52ad24"><gtr:id>c529f621b0051f392e84d83ddb52ad24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Salaman</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780198782827</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56c32108f2dd04.22854056</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C0408A7-9D96-4FA1-9B7E-F78460646EE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do Employee-Owned Firms Produce More Positive Employee Behavioural Outcomes?
