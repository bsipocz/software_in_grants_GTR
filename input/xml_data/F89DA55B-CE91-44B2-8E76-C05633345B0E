Summary

The Government Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) is the personal adviser on science and technology-related activities and policies to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet; and head of the Government Office for Science. He advises on a wide range of science topics including climate change, relying on expertise both from scientists working within Government Departments, from the Departmental Chief Scientific Advisors, and from the Government Office of Science. While there is a wealth of expertise on climate change within Government, the scientific community have a key role to play in providing specific specialist expert knowledge and up to date information on key policy relevant issues. This policy placement would provide analysis and advice as needed to the Government CSA, and to individual Departments, being able to draw on both the published scientific literature and on individual expert advice. This will provide timely information to government, as a rapid response to questions as they arise. It will also identify and analysing key, high-profile climate issues such as fracking, geoengineering, renewables, bioenergy, trade-offs between climate mitigation and food and energy security, and impact of extreme events such as flooding.

Much of the climate change knowledge produced in the UK, and the academic experts producing it, are funded through the Natural Environment Research Council. As a publicaly funded body, it is important that this work is of use to society, and thus that it forms a basis for evidence-based policy. However Government departments often need help to identify who key experts are, and academics need to understand how their work can best meet the needs of current and planned policy, as well as highlight where policies may need to change to continue to achieve desired outcomes for society. This placement will help to facilitate relationships between Government and the academic community, embedding connections and ways of working that will lead to continued and long-lasting engagement.

This placement will work with the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Mark Walport, with the Government Office of Science, with Specific Government Departments such as DECC, Defra, DFID, FCO, and with the independent advisory body on UK emission targets and climate change, the Climate Change Committee. It will identify how science is already being used in government, and build on examples of best practice and gaps to produce a strategic framework for long-term embedded engagement of the academic community in contribution to the needs of policy advisers. This will ensure that government is aware of the best available scientific information, and that the funding and production of science is sensitive to policy needs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74168</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Government Office for Science information event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A763FD1D-7A28-4561-9930-EE63B5DAB5F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>a presentation of what Government Office for Science does in order to encourage academics to engage in communication with Government,, to apply for secondments and internships etc. Several members of staff and students have contacted me directly for further information or support with applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca967d652847.87884056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award funded a policy placement rather than research. I was supporting the Government Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Mark Walport, as Head of Climate Advice in the Government Office for Science (GOS). Sir Mark gives science advise direct to number 10 and Cabinet. My impact int he role included the following:

Paris climate negotiations, post Paris Implementation and the Fifth Carbon Budget: 
? Kept updated with briefings from DECC and the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and regularly briefed the GCSA who in turn communicated with the PM and cabinet.
? arranged for Matthew Bell (Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change) to talk to Council for Science and Technology on Paris outcomes and the fifth Carbon Budget;
? Briefed the GCSA for Inter-ministerial Group on Green Growth meeting on the setting of the Fifth Carbon Budget, which was passed into law.

Communicating Climate Science: GO-S and DECC initiated a series of expert and government workshops which I contributed to. This work is now being led by the expert community, who are planning to seek Research Council funding for a network and training, with GO-S and DECC likely involved in an advisory/user group capacity.
UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA2): This was published in July 2016. I coordinated the GO-S reviews of draft documents. I Briefed the GCSA for opening remarks at a workshop in November 2016 discussing meeting the gaps for the next CCRA.
UK Climate Projections UKCP18: Defra is the government lead on these, I attended government user groups discussions to help guide future products.
Engagement with DECC working groups and meetings cross-government and with the expert community: Co-benefits of climate mitigation; 1.5 degrees (impacts and feasibility), working group on geoengineering, working group on Earth Observation.
Panel member of GO-S roadshows to universities of Bristol and Exeter to raise awareness of the work of GO-S and encourage academics to engage with government
Panel member for Royal Society paring scheme talk to inform academics of role of science in government and the Science advisory network
Participated in the Stern review of the REF, coordinating the GO-S response with several of our recommendations being taken on board in the final published document.
Worked on implementation of the Nurse Review in particular Statements of Need. Initiated a presentation and discussion with RCUK on how to work together with government to respond to Departmental Statements.
Worked on implications of Brexit for research community, contributing to briefings for the GCSA to discuss with number 10 and cabinet. The UK government pledged to support and underwrite EU funding participation.
Responded to Public letters on behalf of the GCSA
Contributed to slides for talks on energy, risk and resilience that the GCSA presented at various public meetings.
Briefed the GCSA for various talks, presentations and discussion panels including for a talk at the NERC PURE, GHG removal meeting.
Briefed the GCSA for media interviews related to climate change.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>08226E4E-7430-4975-8B77-33546601424A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca935c64ada4.23336994</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in DECC group on geoengineering</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF77012B-6420-4333-954F-F6CBF182028D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca99ca385134.49329644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>coordination of Government Office of Science input the the Stern Review of the REF</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A43CC04D-6399-4715-A600-5F97C45FF9A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lord Sterns REF review made various recommendations on how the next REF should be carried out, several of which were influenced by the Gove Office for Science input.
