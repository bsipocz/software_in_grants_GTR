Often this data is large-scale, for example including the genome sequences of thousands of people or thousands of different organisms. Other examples of data types include the 3D structure of proteins, networks of interactions between proteins, gene expression, etc. By taking datasets produced by many experiments, using computers we are able to: answer fundamental questions such as how evolution takes place at the molecular level, and what are the genetic determinants of human phenotypes; answer questions of practical importance such as how to reprogram one human cell type into another for regenerative medicine; and to invent computational tools and techniques that enable others to answer questions of fundamental and practical importance in biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The work of this programme of research is to apply computational and mathematical technology for both the development and application of algorithms and to analyse molecular biology data. The aim in doing this, via the scientific principle of using experimental data predictively, is to either answer fundamental questions in molecular biology or to produce something of practical utility to medical science. Two specific threads of this research include the prediction of phenotype from genotype based on causal molecular biology and the prediction of factors for reprogramming one fully differentiated mature cell type into another.
The prediction of phenotype from genotype combines the assessment of genomic variant consequence (e.g. our published FATHMM approach) with an association of proteins and domains with biomedical ontologies including phenotype and disease (e.g. our published dcGO resource). By bringing these together with human genome sequence data we aim to make links between genetic variants and the phenotypes that they affect through understanding of the molecular function and pathways of proteins and non-coding elements. There is a growing abundance of human genetic data, that will eventually exist for most people in our society, and a great need for increasing and improving the ways in which we can take advantage of this important step the world is taking into our future. The implications of being able to understand in detail the differences between people in their biological makeup range from medicine to sports, lifestyle and society. By knowing of characteristic differences in our individual biology, we will be able to increasingly personalise all these things.
The research on the reprogramming of human cell types involves analysing the network of protein interactions alongside cell-type specific transcriptome data to predict factors that, in combination, may induce trans-differentiation of cells. Our published method called Mogrify has led to some initial experimental successes but there are numerous further developments required to make this more general and to push the boundaries of what is possible in cell fate control, and to better understand the processes which underly cell differentiation. In the long term, the ability to reprogram human cells in vivo would open up an entire field of medicine for manipulating diseased tissues within the body, and for regenerating depleted or injured materials that have been damaged. More immediately, there are already some stem-cell based treatments which may be replaced or improved on by trans-differentiating adult cells without the need for stem cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46151</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1DB47B76-4476-4E5C-8871-69BCAA0E2129</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sendai virus recruits cellular villin to remodel actin cytoskeleton during fusion with hepatocytes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular biology of the cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f4cb9c9c56d00d750720ff3594623f2b"><gtr:id>f4cb9c9c56d00d750720ff3594623f2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chandra S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1059-1524</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a870677437f92.36013453</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1201/14</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
