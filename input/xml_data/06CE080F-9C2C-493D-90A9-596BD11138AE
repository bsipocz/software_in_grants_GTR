Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening lung condition, frequently diagnosed in critical unwell patients. Unfortunately, sufferers often require long stays in intensive care wards, at a major cost to the NHS and currently no drug treatment exists. Patients with ALI have 40% chance of dying and those that survive have severe long-term physical and psychological problems. Therefore urgent research is needed to improve scientific knowledge of this lethal condition and identify new therapies.

Acute Lung Injury 
In this condition, there is a sudden failure of the breathing system, with difficulty getting oxygen into the lungs. Therefore oxygen cannot get into the blood and cannot be delivered to other organs. It is a lethal condition, affecting both children and adults, and kills 40% of patients who develop the condition. It usually affects those patients who are already very unwell due to another disease or who have major injuries. 

Research question and Importance
Microvesicles (MVs) are very small particles released by cells when they are damaged, injured or inflamed. Recent research has demonstrated that MVs carry messages between cells and it is now known that they have an important role in cell-to-cell communication. As such, MVs have been shown to have important roles in many inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease and hypertension. However their role has not been examined in ALI, which is another inflammatory disease. My initial results have found that MVs are present in ALI and they carry important inflammatory molecules. We have also found that they can cause inflammatory reactions in previously, healthy cells. We will examine whether MVs have a major role in ALI. If our results demonstrate that MVs play a major role in ALI, this would allow development of new medicines that can stop MVs and thus treat this deadly disease. 

Research Methods
I am performing this project under the direction and guidance of my supervisors (Professor Takata, Dr Michael Wilson, Dr Kieran O'Dea) at the Section of Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care at Imperial College London. Part of this study will also take place in National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College with Professor Adcock and Dr Mark Perry. The project will involve detailed laboratory experiments working with cells found in the lungs. MVs will be created from these lung cells and we will identify their exact function and whether they can directly activate other cells found in the lungs. We will also investigate whether inhibiting the production or absorption of MVs in the lungs, will ease symptoms and signs of ALI. Furthermore, we will explore and identify what messages these MVs carry between lung cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims and Objectives
I aim to establish the significance of Microvesicles (MVs) in Acute Lung Injury (ALI), investigating three central objectives:
1. To explore if patterns of MV release can be used to distinguish between the phases of ALI.
2. To investigate the inflammatory mediators and biological cargo carried in MVs 
3. To identify the role of MVs in the pathogenesis, potentially inspiring novel therapeutic targets.

Methodology
I will use clinically relevant mouse models of ALI, where the acute inflammatory, fibrotic and resolution phases are readily identifiable. MV kinetics/profiles (i.e. number and cell origin) will be identified in these phases by flow cytometry and will be compared. To characterise the information relayed through MV in ALI, MV pellets will be collected from different acute and chronic ALI models and intra-vesicular mediators (e.g. interleukins and cytokines) will be measured by ELISA/flow cytometry. RNA from MVs will be extracted and quantified through real-time RT-PCR. To characterise the functional significance of MVs in ALI, I will produce MVs from alveolar cells and incubate them with other alveolar cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Cellular responses will be assessed to determine if MVs can activate intra-alveolar cells. Attenuation of these responses in models where MV production/uptake is inhibited (i.e. in knock-out mice or though pharmacological means) will also be assessed.

Scientific and medical opportunities 
These results will provide crucial information for the scientific community on the pathophysiology of ALI, potentially identifying a novel, previously unexplored communication pathway between intra-alveolar cells. This may explain why therapies for ALI to date have proved ineffective and as such the results from this project may allow the development of new opportunities for therapeutic strategies for ALI.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our aim, in this basic science/translational study, is to investigate the biological and functional role of microvesicles (MVs) in acute lung injury (ALI). Due to the lack of effective therapies for ALI, there remains an urgent need for a redirection in ALI research to identify new treatments. MVs may provide valuable information about the pathophysiological process of ALI and may prove to be novel therapeutic targets. Consequently, this project may have a significant impact amongst academics, clinicians, patients, the NHS and potentially, commercial private sectors.

Academic Impact
There are over 21000 journal articles on ALI yet despite this intense research activity, academic understanding of ALI contains large discrepancies, mortality remains unacceptably high (~40%). ALI management is hampered by the lack of any pharmaceutical treatment, diagnostic tool or biomarkers. MVs have the potential to fulfill all three roles. MVs have already been implicated in the pathophysiology and as potential biomarkers in a number of other inflammatory conditions. However there is a paucity of literature regarding the role of MVs in ALI. Due to the diverse and clinically relevant ALI models developed in our laboratory, we are in a unique position to investigate the role of MVs in ALI. Therefore this project has an excellent opportunity to enhance the knowledge and expertise of ALI for academics, identify and explore a previously unknown mechanism of intra-alveolar cell communication and potentially highlight a new therapeutic target. We have developed protocols that readily identify which cells MVs are derived from (see case for support for data), this research could have significant impact in academia as MVs may resolve several controversies in ALI e.g. the source of inflammatory mediators in the intra-alveolar space. We will continue to develop our novel and innovative methodology, so that our techniques can impact and inspire other laboratories to measure MVs in other inflammatory conditions. 

Clinical Impact
Our preliminary results show that MVs are readily measureable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from an ALI model and that these MVs are carriers of biological cargo in ALI including TNF alpha. Furthermore alveolar macrophage-derived MVs act as vectors, transferring RNA between intra-alveolar cells. Our pilot data also illustrates that MVs are functionally active and can activate endothelial cells in-vitro. Consequently MVs may be heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of ALI and although this project is basic science in concept, it may provide major steps in the establishment of pharmaceutical therapies for ALI. Furthermore, MVs may be a valuable diagnostic and disease-monitoring tool as they are readily measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. As such, MVs may have a significant clinical impact in the management of ALI.

Business Impact
Due to the novelty of this research and it's potential impact on clinicians, academics and patients, the project may attract grants/research and development funds from businesses/pharmaceutical industry. 

Society Impact
The mortality from ALI remains unacceptably high (~40%). Additionally those patients that survive have significant physical and psychological morbidity. These unfavorable statistics are certainly related to complex, pathogenesis of this syndrome with multiple signaling pathways activated. Our research may increase the knowledge surrounding the pathophysiology of ALI and provide major steps in the establishment of pharmaceutical therapies for ALI. These would improve mortality figures, enhancing the quality life, health and well-being our patients.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256126</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Brompton Hospital</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>LUNG VOLUME REDUCTION FOR COPD MICROVESICLES study: 'Studying epithelial microvesicle production in patients treated with lung volume reduction for emphysema'</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A4D00F1-48C7-4E3E-A7B8-A84428EDE17B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as of yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bff16163d5b2.48528492-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Royal Brompton Team sample the patients and perform detailed clinical examination/investigations in order to stage their disease severity.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Royal Brompton Team perform bronchoscopies on patients with severe COPD, taking bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood and bronchial brushings.

triggers cells to release microvesicles (MVs), which play crucial roles in cellular communication by ferrying molecular cargo between cells. MVs may protect its contents from dilution, degradation or consumption, yet there is a paucity of literature examining TNF release within intra-alveolar MVs. We aimed to investigate if ATP causes alveolar macrophages (AM) to preferentially release TNF within MVs. Primary mouse AMs were activated with 1&amp;micro;g/ml LPS, and then exposed to a 'second hit' of ATP 6mM/ecto-ATPase inhibitor 1mM for 1 hour to produce MVs (identified on flow cytometry as CD11c+, &amp;lt;1&amp;micro;m, detergent-sensitive events). TNF/IL-6 content of MV pellets and MV-free supernatants (separated by high-speed centrifugation) were analyzed by ELISA/western blotting and compared to control (LPS stimulation alone).</gtr:description><gtr:id>5AAE01A5-7A3A-4068-8D3C-6199A3026496</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ATP treatment eradicated soluble TNF release from AMs (Control 107&amp;plusmn;13 pg vs ATP 4.8&amp;plusmn;6.1 pg, p&amp;lt;0.01 N=5-7) but substantively upregulated TNF content within MVs (0.5&amp;plusmn;3.6 vs 26.8&amp;plusmn;8.5, p&amp;lt;0.01 N=5-7) as measured by ELISA. Western blotting confirmed these findings including 17kDa TNF within MVs. ATP did not significantly alter the profile of IL-6 release in the soluble (Control 14.53&amp;plusmn;6.0 pg vs ATP 6.0&amp;plusmn;0.5 pg, N=3-4) or MV fraction (3.1&amp;plusmn;0.7 vs 2.4&amp;plusmn;0.3 pg, N=3-4), suggesting this 'switch' may be specific to TNF. These data show that a danger signal such as ATP, superimposed onto a pro-inflammatory stimulus, suppresses TNF release from AMs in the ordinary soluble form but preferentially packages TNF within MVs. This switch phenomenon indicates a novel mechanism of long-range TNF signalling in inflammatory lung diseases such as acute lung injury.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46cb52713d4.51171220</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>ATP selectively packages TNF within microvesicles released from alveolar macrophages</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY - STAINING PROTOCOL

Our results indicate that danger signals superimposed onto pro-inflammatory signals can switch macrophage TNF release from the ordinary soluble from to the MV-associated form, suggesting a novel mechanism of long-range MV-associated TNF transfer in case of significant tissue injury.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46d78c8eaa6.44740856</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Macrophages preferentially package TNF within microvesicles in response to ATP</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61FFEB91-C8A7-47BE-9FDB-BBE017BB2B1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Late Breaking Abstract - Alveolar macrophages preferentially take up microvesicles in the alveolar space</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625"><gtr:id>4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Soni S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a987a9f9f5fd2.53836912</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1ACC4765-0720-4BEF-9648-66B4A4BB663D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Microvesicles derived from alveolar macrophages mediate epithelial activation via a TNF dependant mechanism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625"><gtr:id>4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Soni S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d46746a156a7.83790271</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE7171FE-69D9-443A-A2C8-784323D6E5C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alveolar macrophage-derived microvesicles mediate acute lung injury.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Thorax</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625"><gtr:id>4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Soni S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-6376</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d6114994a14.09748830</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EAF8421-538D-4A3C-AE99-0AE45B7C2FA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>ATP selectively packages TNF within microvesicles released from alveolar macrophages</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625"><gtr:id>4bc05db55e7cae02d0ea5bb1b33bf625</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Soni S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b4429ff1c7c6.49322498</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M018164/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
