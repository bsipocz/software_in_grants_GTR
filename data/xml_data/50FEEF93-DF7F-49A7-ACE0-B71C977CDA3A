The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences is dedicated to enabling UK researchers to interact with the best scientists from around the world, in themed research Programmes. The cross-disciplinary breadth of Programmes is extraordinary; the Institute is a place where the underpinning mathematics is brought to bear on big scientific issues. As well as research in mathematics per se, future Programmes and workshops include: challenges in genome analysis; laboratory and astrophysical plasmas; uncertainties in climate modelling and prediction; the design and analysis of experiments; the mathematics and applications of branes in string and M-theory; topological dynamics in the physical and biological sciences; and adaptive mesh modelling in the atmosphere and ocean. The quality of the Programmes and the unrivalled INI environment have attracted, in the years 2005-9, the winners of 5 Fields Medals, 3 Nobel Prizes, 5 Wolf Prizes, and 2 Abel Prizes.The environment for participants is exceptional: a dedicated and purpose-designed building; office, computing and AV support including a state of practice multi-media environment for video recording, webcasting and videoconferencing; superb library support including over 40,000 books in Mathematical Sciences within 50 metres of the Institute and access to the full library of Cambridge University; the opportunity to interact with the wider community in Cambridge and nearby Institutes; and experienced staff who know what works, and who provide full support to organisers and participants, to enable them to focus on their science. Questionnaire responses show that the commitment of staff is hugely appreciated. Institute Programmes are generally of six, four or one month's duration, with usually two Programmes running in parallel, each with 20-30 scientists in residence. Programmes include particularly intense periods of instructional courses and workshops for 100 or more scientists, which are frequently held elsewhere in the UK to maximise opportunity for the UK community and access for early career researchers. The format is well-established and has been exceptionally successful in the 86 Programmes run to date. The collaborations established between UK scientists and with those from elsewhere often continue and bear fruit over a long period; this is fostered by one-week follow-up meetings to earlier Programmes. The Institute responds to shorter term needs through 'Open for Business' meetings with industry and business, and scoping meetings to support the development of innovative multidisciplinary proposals. The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) is at the heart of a rigorous peer review process involving up to eight referees, to ensure that every Programme is of the highest quality. In forming their judgements, the SSC considers these reports in the context of: the quality of the research proposed; its timeliness; the opportunities it offers to bring together different branches of mathematics and/or application areas; demand from and value to the UK community; and the potential impact which the special environment of the Institute can engender. The SSC also takes account of activities at other Institutes world-wide. Out-reach activities of the Institute include involvement with the Cambridge Science Festival, and growing a network of people in business, primarily in the City, who value the Institute, and the opportunity that it gives to engage informally with leading scientists. More than 75 business people have been involved to date, and they will be the basis for a fundraising effort to help ensure the future well-being of the Institute, and that there are no financial barriers to participation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>HEFCE acknowledges the indirect route to impact through other disciplines, citing how 'research in mathematics could influence engineering research that in turn has an economic impact'. This is generic for mathematics, which mostly acts as a 'lubricant' through myriad small improvements. Algorithm development is at least as significant for all modelling as the increase in raw computer power. An example illustrates that the pathway may be long and highly competitive. In 1997, CM Bishop organised a Programme on Neural Networks and Machine Learning. A workshop brought together experts in probability, graphs and learning machines. His group in MS Research Cambridge developed ideas from this approach to win the competition against 19 other teams for the algorithm to 'monetise' (i.e. optimise income stream for a given commercial policy) for their search engine Bing in 2009. The value to Microsoft is substantial, not least in helping it gain market share against Google. Because of the breadth of Programmes at the INI, there are potential beneficiaries in many sectors, in addition to those in academe. We expect the research done by participants at the INI to impact on policy as well as industry, commerce and the health sector. The INI will also continue public engagement activities. Given that participants are present for only up to six months, tracking impact is at least as challenging as tracking publications. The lean staffing of the Institute means that 'impact' activities are done in partnership with other organisations. Impact in industry and commerce: The Institute has an open door policy for industry and business, with no Intellectual Property constraints. It has introduced real-time webcast and video conferencing, so that those unable to come because of their experiments or business demands are able contribute and interact. The Scientific Steering Committee now gives consideration to potential business interest at the time of Programme selection. Six 'Open for Business' workshops have been run to date in partnership with the Knowledge Transfer Network in Industrial Mathematics, attracting more than 100 from business and other organisations as well as more than 150 academics; the KTN network of contacts is invaluable in this regard. Areas of potential impact are the pharmaceutical and insurance sectors through the future Programmes in genome sequencing, design of experiments and climate modelling. Impact in policy: Two recent 'Open for Business' meetings, in communications and in future energy were also relevant for policy issues. The former was run in collaboration with the University's Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP), and the latter attracted participants from the regulator Ofgem and senior scientists from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, as well as mathematicians, power engineers, control engineers, economists, industrialists from major energy suppliers and power network managers. Future Programme areas have the potential to impact in the policy arena, in health, and in climate change. We will continue to draw on the expertise in CSaP whose workshops, secondments and fellowships are recognised in Whitehall as being both highly efficient in the use of time, and effective in the senior connections created, to help realise the potential of policy impact. Public engagement: Although the winners of the on-line Imaginary competition came from the UK, Iran and China, our target audience is primarily regional and local, in the general public and schools. We will work with the Cambridge Science Festival, to provide lectures and events attracting at least 100 visitors pa. We will mount on the University's YouTube EDU channel at least 6 more publicly accessible talks pa. Through dinners hosted by the Chair of the Management Committee we will expand the network of people in the City and business (from 75 now to more than 100 by 2013), who value the Institute and their engagement with science through it.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>443221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Cavendish Laboratory</gtr:department><gtr:description>Soft Matter - Theoretical and Industrial Challenges</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3898E2B-F71E-4293-B213-16B417B5B813</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Building on the foundations laid by Sir Sam Edwards, talks provided leading-edge advances and insights into soft matter systems and their applications.

Participants are invited to share their latest engineering problems and proposed solutions so as to promote the creation and exchange of ideas and the identification of new trends and required developments.

The 1st UK workshop on Optimisation in Space Engineering (OSE) was held on 5-6 November 2013 in Birmingham with one of the outputs being the formation of a national working group. This event was jointly organised by the Turing Gateway to Mathematics (TGM), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the University of Southampton, and it was hosted by the University of Birmingham. In this first meeting, participants shared their latest engineering problems and proposed solutions so as to promote the creation and exchange of ideas and the identification of new trends and required developments. 

The 2nd OSE workshop held in Cambridge on 19- 20 March 2014 took forward outputs generated from the first workshop, such as identified challenges and issues. The event sought to address these through a series of talks, discussion and break-out group type activities. Feedback indicated the value of engagement between academia and industry, especially at an early stage of a problem formation. Additionally, a number of example space engineering optimisation problems were investigated and the solutions compared and contrasted to gain understanding of the efficiency of the various techniques.

The 3rd workshop took place at the University of Strathclyde on 17-18 September 2015 and helped to widen the sphere of expertise to Europe. A space challenge competition was run as part of this event and an open discussion on this took place at the workshop. 
The challenges were chosen because of their relevance to actual space missions:

Reports from the organisers of each programmes are available on the Institute's website, with details of publications and lectures for doanloading on http://www.newton.ac.uk/.

In March 2013, the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences launched the Turing Gateway to Mathematics. The TGM is an impact initiative of the INI and aims to stimulate the interchange of knowledge and ideas between academics of different disciplines and users of modern mathematics. Named after Alan Turing because of his exceptionally wide influence across a very broad front, the Gateway is a channel for collaboration and cooperation between academia and industry. It will help to shorten pathways to impact and increase access to modern mathematical methods for other industrial and academic areas.

Since the TGM was established, it has consolidated its presence, delivering a range of activities across a number of different themes and sectors including financial risk, space and security sectors, Big Data and public policy.

TGM Mission Statement
The Turing Gateway to Mathematics acts as a channel for the flow of knowledge and ideas between the mathematical sciences and the users of mathematics. It does this by facilitating interactions and activities such as programmes of work, events, projects, education and training in areas where maths skills are needed. Acting as a gateway between academic mathematicians and industry, government, and other disciplines, it helps to widen access to mathematics generally and shorten pathways to impacts. 

In addition to running the visitor research programmes, the Isaac Newton Institute brings academic researchers in the mathematical sciences together with industrial, commercial and government organisations and individuals through activities such as the Open for Business events. The success of these events (see http://www.newton.ac.uk/ofb/ ) together with follow-up activity associated with the Institute's research programmes is a key motivation for the Turing Gateway to Mathematics initiative.

The TGM continues to nurture and expand engagement, and strategic relationships with the public sector, academia and industry are ongoing. This has been achieved by facilitating interactions and activities such as programmes of work, consultations, workshops, research and training programmes, as well as less formal, small working groups in which academics and business personnel work together. This approach enables engagement between individuals and organisations who were not previously working together and helps to achieve greater synergy across activity and more creative and imaginative approaches. This flexibility helps address targeted activity, without being proscriptive.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD9FA012-0A43-41C4-A51E-CABB82E78EAA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5462267a609576.95905228</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Isaac Newton Institute is internationally acclaimed as a world-leading visitor research institute, running Programmes of the highest quality in the mathematical sciences and its applications.
