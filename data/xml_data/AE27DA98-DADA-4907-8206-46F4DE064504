Although political historians have documented many of the crises that led to the disgrace of powerful ministers or the exile of institutions such as the parlements, there is almost no scholarship devoted to the effects of this punishment. This research project will approach the problem from a variety of angles, and will examine it over a long chronological period with the intention of analysing how disgrace was understood and experienced during the classic period of the absolute monarchy. \n\nThe book will begin by defining disgrace, which for a society obsessed by aristocratic conceptions of honour was, in theory, the greatest misfortune that could befall an individual. It was a fate comparable to that of a Christian denied God's grace, and to be cast out by the king was the equivalent to a secular malediction, leaving the individual ostracized and potentially powerless.Through a series of case studies it is possible to demonstrate what disgrace meant in practice, and I will consider the rights of a prisoner or exile and how their fate affected the lives and interests of their families. Attention will be paid to the daily lifestyle of those in disgrace, their contacts with their peer groups and society at large. An attempt will also be made to establish how many members of the French political elite were disgraced, the nature and duration of their punishment, and to assess whether the numbers were changing over the period as a whole. This is particularly important at a time when the revisionist interpretation of Louis XIV's absolutism is being challenged with a renewed emphasis upon the authoritarian nature of his rule. By adopting a long-term perspective it should be possible to make meaningful comparisons between his reign and that of his successors and provide an insight into the changing relationship between the monarchy and its elites. \n\nA study of disgrace also offers a means of investigating the political culture of the old regime. In 1630, Cardinal de Richelieu's triumph in the Day of Dupes was swiftly followed by the imprisonment and execution of his chief opponents. Nicolas Fouquet narrowly escaped a similar fate in 1661 before being sentenced to life imprisonment, and throughout the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV ministers were exiled to their estates once royal favour had been lost. Yet during the reign of Louis XVI, Jacques Necker could resign from office and subsequently campaign to be reinstated behaving in a manner that caused contemporary commentators to discuss the emergence of a political 'opposition' comparable to that in Great Britain. This more lenient interpretation of disgrace could be interpreted as a sign that the political authority of the monarchy was weakening, and public opinion clearly had a major role to play. Attempts to exile or imprison those who had offended the king were increasingly met by accusations of despotism, and one of the aims of this project will be to examine the attitude of French society to political disgrace. Indeed, by the eighteenth century there were certain circumstances in which to attract the king's displeasure was a source of honour, even pride, as the reaction of both bishops and magistrates to exile demonstrates. The role of 'disgrace with honour' in legitimising opposition to the monarchy will therefore be examined in detail. Far from being ossified, the French political system was constantly changing and a study of political punishment and disgrace offers a new insight into the government of the absolute monarchy and the culture and society of the old regime.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20307</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G008779/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
