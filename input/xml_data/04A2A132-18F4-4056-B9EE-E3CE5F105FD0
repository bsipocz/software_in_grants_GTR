The importance of the relatively recent computer science contribution to this process is acknowledged by the development of a new science, referred to as bioinformatics, which encompasses a variety of topics, but whose principal aim is the extraction and organization of useful information from the huge amount of sequences and structural data coming out of the various genome projects. In order to perform their functions, the gene products, proteins, must fold into unique, characteristic structures. The experimentally determined or confidently predicted structure helps ascertain the relevance of a given protein from the medical and pharmacological point of view. SCOP: Structural Classification of Proteins database, available on the web at http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop, is a comprehensive, hierarchical ordering of all proteins of known structures according to their evolutionary and structural relationships. Created by manual inspection, and abetted by a battery of automated methods, it provides a broad survey of all known protein folds, detailed information about the relatives of any particular protein, and a framework for future research and classification. A unique aspect of SCOP is that it embeds a theory of evolution as defined by a human expert, rather than the necessarily more limited set of rules implemented by a series of algorithms and automatic tools. New evolutionary and structural relationships are discovered as part of regular updates of the database that incorporate newly determined protein structures. The systematic exploration of these new and existing relationships allows the assignment of putative structures and functions to many gene products some of which cannot be attributed by purely automated methods. The proteins whose structures are predicted by this approach come from all genome projects and include so-called hypothetical proteins, i.e., presumed proteins that lack any detectable sequence similarity to other proteins of known function. The prediction of structure and function for gene product from pathogens would help the identification of potential drug targets. This knowledge-based approach to protein structure prediction was proven to successfully compete with best computational methods. On the other hand, the knowledge embedded in SCOP has allowed the calibration of computational methods used for the recognition of sequence homology which led, in turn, to more accurate automated assignments of structure and function to a substantial fraction of proteins in complete genomes.In general, biological databases in all their diversity are an indispensable contribution to the scientific enterprise for interpreting and composing the huge amount of experimental data into a coherent understanding of life. The role played by these databases can only increase as the volume and intrinsic complexity of biological data rapidly expand. The annotation, integration and distribution of sequence and structure data are the objectives of our collaboration with other public databases supported by the MRC.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2000-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>926724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database organises protein of known structures according to their structural and evolutionary relationships.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DDFC51FA-CDB0-4E54-95D2-AC00DEED2CB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SCOP database has been established in 1994.
Over the years, SCOP has facilitated the development of bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis, structure prediction, and genome annotation etc. Directly or indirectly, it allows biologists to interpret their own and others experimental results, as well as create new hypotheses. This increases the pace of basic research, leading to increased understanding of basic biology and disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458ef015e8132.04438181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The SCOP database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U105459889</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1A41A859-2076-46E6-B80F-CE4E1E8EDC1D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.5  Resources and infrastructure (underpinning)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
