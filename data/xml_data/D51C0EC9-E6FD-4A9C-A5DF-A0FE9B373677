This section focuses on Hugues Panassi&amp;eacute; - the leading critical authority on jazz in Europe before WWII - and the fan society the Hot-club de France, of which Panassi&amp;eacute; was president. In chapter 1 I explore the volatile French and European politics of the 1930s, and trace Panassi&amp;eacute;'s intellectual and religious formation, to show how trends in nationalist, anti-modernist French Catholic thought informed the critic's highly influential conceptualisation of jazz as primitive folk expression. In chapter 2 I examine how, in creating a pedagogic canon of jazz recordings for Hot-club members - and demonstrating in prose and person how the recorded music should be felt - Panassi&amp;eacute; aimed via the phonograph to educate the 'alienated' modern French in the ways of 'groove' and an embodied black musical culture. Panassi&amp;eacute;'s insights into jazz, though products of an obsession with racial exceptionalism, are often musically valuable; here I also ask what use we might make of such tainted knowledge, and how contemporary attitudes towards difference sometimes repeat historical follies. 2) ART. In trying to escape the primitivism that early writers had accorded jazz-as-folk expression, post-war French critics began to construct for the style a framework of value - based on ideas of historical progression and the individual genius - transferred, problematically, from the Western art tradition. Chapter 3 examines analytically the work of the jazz composer/critic Andr&amp;eacute; Hodeir, who sought to overcome worries of French 'inauthenticity' by assimilating the foreign (jazz improvisation) into the familiar (his own art music composition). This topic is examined from the reverse angle in chapter 4, which discusses the reception French critics, including Hodccorded Thelonious Monk. In the 1950s Monk was revered for his innovative, 'authentic' improvisation, but in the early-60s French writers began to censure the pianist for having ceased to 'evolve', and, in 1964, for presenting 'composed' improvisations in several Paris performances; each representing and practising music traditions imagined not fully accessible to the other, Monk and Hodeir embodied anxieties around authenticity and synthesis which, as well as being identifiable in 60s French critical discourse, I show still to be current. 3) WORLD. This section tracks the ways that artists and critics made use of an 'American' music to critique US and global political issues in the 1960s. In chapter 5 I examine jazz in French cinema, specifically that of Jean-Luc Godard. For a post-war generation fascinated by American cultural genres, Martial Solal's soundtrack to 1960's &amp;Agrave; bout de souffle reinforced ideals of cosmopolitan modernity; but like jazz itself, this representation was gradually overwhelmed by radicalised images of African American cultural and political activity which, in films like 1968's One Plus One, were mobilised to attack US policy. This reception of US black liberation politics also became central to jazz media discourses; in chapter 6 I argue that in magazines like Jazz-hot, critics, musicians and letter-writing fans can be seen using 'musical' debates to explore France's place in the post-colonial world. This exploration is also the subject of a close reading of Barney Wilen's 1970s album Moshi, assembled from jazz improvisation, politicized song lyrics and field recordings taken by the saxophonist in the former French Africa. In conclusion the chapter examines the 1970s dissipation of both jazz and radical politics as forces in France, and the ways in which classic images of this French jazz history - like that of Josephine Baker, who, at the study's end, dies in Paris as a Knight of the Legion d'Honneur - have since been put to cultural use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's main output is the 80,000-word book, but at the start of the fellowship period I will also prepare and, with Alyn Shipton, co-present a BBC Radio 3 Jazz Library programme (contingent upon the series' recommission, which is highly likely though yet to be confirmed officially). Together, these outputs will have the following kinds of impact. INSTRUMENTAL BENEFITS: in providing newly researched content for the radio programme I will bring economic benefits to the cultural industry and knowledge economy, specifically the production company Unique and the BBC itself. The book's main instrumental benefits have been outlined elsewhere (see 'Academic Beneficiaries'), but it will also bring economic benefits to the eventual publishers. INTRINSIC PERSONAL BENEFITS: With both radio and book outputs, I will strive to give both insight and pleasure to a general audience, heightening their understanding and enjoyment of the musical and historical topics treated therein, and in some small way contributing to listeners' and readers' quality of life. INTRINSIC COMMUNITY BENEFITS: In their discussion and airing of ideas and music so far little attended-to in any Anglophone context, both book and radio programme will raise awareness, on the part of scholarly and general audiences, of a neglected European musical and cultural history and heritage. And since my project is historical, so the topics both outputs will bring to their audiences will be apt to invite the development of empathy and analysis - those primary features of historical engagement - on the part of readers and listeners. It is in this way that I consider any effective communication of research to be a pedagogic (as distinct from didactic) act; I hope that audiences encountering the project outputs, whether in scholarly or public engagement contexts, will be inspired to reflect upon their important main themes, and those debates around issues of race, tradition, modernity and European identity that are as pertinent to us today as they were to my historical subjects.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64854</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>After Django: Making Jazz in Postwar France has already been the subject of highly visible, highly positive reviews in the New York Review of Books (Adam Schatz, http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/07/09/le-jazz-hot/) and Times Higher Education (Les Gofton, https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/after-django-making-jazz-in-postwar-france-by-tom-perchard/2020062.article). 

A secondary, public-facing output was a BBC Radio 3 broadcast on one of the book's subjects, Barney Wilen. Because of a BBC scheduling change, this programme, which was listed in the application as a public-facing output, in fact had to take place just before the start of my research fellowship. However it was successful and has been archived on the programme website: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0150dw3</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0EE92C82-01A2-4720-85F4-2D0AF9A8BEAF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d483ab541a52.72056479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My project's primary output was the manuscript of a monograph on jazz in France. The most significant achievement of the award has been the subsequent publication of a monograph, After Django: Making Jazz in Postwar France (University of Michigan Press 2015). This was the major output objective for the project. 

After Django asks: how did French musicians and critics interpret jazz - that quintessentially American music - in the mid-20th century? How far did players reshape what they learned from records and visitors into more local jazz forms, and how did the music figure in those angry debates that so often suffused French cultural and political life? Answers to these questions constitute my project's key findings. The book begins with the famous interwar triumphs of Josephine Baker and Django Reinhardt, but, for the first time, the focus falls on the French jazz practices of the postwar era. The work of important but neglected French musicians like Andr&amp;eacute; Hodeir and Barney Wilen is examined in depth, as are native responses to Americans like Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk: French observers argued about and made use of the music's icons in startlingly original ways, and often in writings still unfamiliar to Anglophone readers. 

Academic beneficiaries include the peer reviewers who reported on the manuscript for the press' editorial board. They called the work 'as good as anything I've read in recent years, a remarkable book that is bound to make a huge contribution' (Prof. Eric Drott, University of Texas at Austin); 'a vital contribution to the ongoing expanded scholarly account of jazz in its global dimension, written by an author who knows his stuff inside and out, and has consistently illuminating points to make about the Francophone scene that are transferable to a broader perspective on jazz as such, re-configuring many basic assumptions about a music all too preemptively conceived as authentically American' (Jed Rasula, University of Georgia).

A much smaller, public-facing objective was also met (detailed in the impact narrative).

The key objectives of my project were thus all met.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings will be taken forward (and the book has already been cited) by a growing body of researchers on jazz outside the United States.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2BAC05A1-780D-43A5-B9CE-FCE9F99CDD69</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd89716d8f66.83895557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.press.umich.edu/5838566/after_django</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6EA347F-75B1-4904-BD79-4C4C96003C58</gtr:id><gtr:title>After Django: Making Jazz in Postwar France</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a96d71bb8ea00d5f0e2f12383525dad6"><gtr:id>a96d71bb8ea00d5f0e2f12383525dad6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perchard Tom</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780472072422</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56499d134ace54.08499644</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I027444/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8F220D14-A48F-413D-9D9E-0756C51CE2B0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
