This proposal for impact and engagement is designed to create greater impact from the research than was unforeseen at the time of the original application due to unexpected regulatory reforms to consumer credit and welfare reforms, which have impacted on the consumer credit landscape and led to fast changing nature of the debates. 

We will work with lenders of affordable credit, specifically the UK Credit Union sector, ABCUL, ACE and Birmingham based Citysave Credit Union to develop innovative and creative strategies for improving the level of responsible lending through:
1. Workshops at UK Credit Union conferences - we will co-produce materials based on our research findings in order for them to understand and support responsible borrowing amongst their members for longer-term impact beyond the project. 
2. Supporting Credit Union staff and board member training in the challenges for responsible lending and borrowing within the broader credit landscape.
3. Facilitating knowledge exchange events on responsible lending and borrowing for key regulators, practitioners, and policymakers within responsible credit in the Australian and UK context to share experiences of consumer credit regulatory reform, and facilitating access to affordable credit for low to moderate income communities. 

This project is therefore extremely timely and relevant to challenge public debates on responsible lending and borrowing. The project will feed into these debates via the Credit Union network and key stakeholders within the lending and borrowing space, particularly policymakers and regulators which will make a significant impact upon credit union members and borrowers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Building on the FinCris 'Responsible lending and borrowing' workstream, the project will enhance the project impact on informing and influencing the responsible credit landscape and debates. Moreover, the key impact from this project is to encourage greater responsible lending and borrowing for the benefit of the Credit Union movement, particularly its staff, board members, and their membership. This project will also influence debates on access to affordable credit for low and moderate income communities more broadly.
 
By engaging with regulators, policymakers and practitioners in workshops and knowledge exchange events we can share our research findings and discuss directly the key drivers of responsible lending and borrowing to inform and influence best practice.
 
Practitioners working in Credit Unions will benefit from the good practice guide by informing best practices and sharing with recently recruited staff and board members. The good practice guide will also act as a useful 'refresher' for more experienced staff members. We will highlight the broader context in which Credit Unions are operating in and the key challenges that they are currently experiencing around welfare reform, and the sustainability and the significance of these issues in relation to responsible lending and borrowing practices.

The Credit Union membership will benefit from this project through informing best practice and making the good practice guide openly available online so that Credit Union lending practices are as transparent as possible which is one of the key factors in responsible lending. 

This project will address responsible lending and borrowing for the broader benefit of economy and society by informing and influencing public debates and practices, including consumer credit regulation and access to affordable credit such as from Credit Unions. The invitation of Australian stakeholders to share their experience will add a significant global dimension to the debates on responsible lending and borrowing for each country to learn lessons and facilitate knowledge exchange. These activities will ensure impact within and beyond the timescale of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006019/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
