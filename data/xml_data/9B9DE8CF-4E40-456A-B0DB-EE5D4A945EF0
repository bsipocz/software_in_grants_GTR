Some of these are very toxic but others have proved to be useful leads for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals, e.g. antibiotics such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, and taxol which has emerged for the treatment of certain cancers. About 20 years ago, a new group of very complex natural products, the bryostatins, was isolated from a marine animal, Buluga neritina, a bryozoan filter feeder, although more recently it has emerged that these compounds are actually produced by a micro-organism which cohabits with the bryozoan. The bryostatins were immediately recognized as having potent anti-cancer activity and have been of considerable interest to medicinal and synthetic chemists since. Although some side effects are observed when patients are treated with bryostatins, there are marked improvements when the bryostatins are prescribed in combination with other chemotherapies. The bryostatins have also been found to have many other potentially useful biological activities such as stimulation of the immune system, reversal of damage due to a stroke and memory enhancement in animal models. The actual modes of action of the bryostatins are partly understood although more remains to be done in this area.Notwithstanding these exciting biological activities, there are severe problems in the supply of bryostatins. To date they have been isolated from the natural marine source, but this is environmentally unacceptable and also very unreliable, for example, an aquaculture programme for the production of bryostatins has recently been discontinued. The bryostatins have been synthesized by organic chemists, but the early syntheses were very long and were not convergent, and so did not add to the supply of bryostatins for biological evaluation. More recently bryostatin like compounds have been designed. Some of these possess the activities of the natural bryostatins and are under clinical evaluation.The objectives of the present work are to develop a new and more convergent synthesis of bryostatins which can be used to provide material for biological evaluation. Initially the work will target a sub-group of bryostatins which has not been prepared before. Once the chemistry to achieve this objective has been sorted out, it will be applied to complete syntheses of other bryostatins and simpler analogues for biological evaluation.The synthesis which it is proposed to carry out has been studied for many years. It is hoped to complete the synthesis of a naturally occurring bryostatin in about thirty linear, i.e. sequential, steps. To date the first twenty six of these have been carried out successfully. It remains to find reagents and conditions for the final four steps and then to complete syntheses of naturally occurring bryostatins and analogues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A completed synthesis of a naturally occurring bryostatin will be recognized internationally by synthetic organic chemists as a major achievement and will help to underpin the reputation of the UK's organic chemistry community. Moreover, the publications on our results in chemical journals will be read by other synthetic chemists in industry and academia and will help them with their own work. The bryostatins have potent anti-cancer activity and have been involved in many clinical trials world-wide. However, the supply of bryostatins from natural sources is very limited indeed. It is proposed to develop a synthesis of bryostatins which will be convergent and less than 30 linear steps long. Such a synthesis could be used to prepare samples of the natural compounds or structural analogues of the natural products for biological studies. This work could then help to lead to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of action of bryostatins and may even contribute to the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. If this is the case then the work would have a major economic impact. Arrangements are in place with life-scientists in Manchester and Liverpool for advanced intermediates and any analogues prepared to be evaluated biologically. Once a synthesis of a natural bryostatin has been completed, medicinal chemists who have published on PKCs will be approached to see whether our compounds (or chemistry) is of interest to them. Aspects of this programme will be outside the scope of the work which it is expected to be able to complete during the course this grant. Nevertheless our synthesis should be able to deliver either several hundred milligrammes of one natural bryostatin, or an analogue, or it could be used to prepare smaller amounts, say twenty milligramme batches, of several compounds for biological screens. It should be noted that commercial sources of bryostatins are very expensive indeed, ca. 181 for a tenth of a milligramme on one web-site. However, it will be necessary to complete a synthesis of a naturally occurring bryostatin first so that the final stages of the synthesis are understood, before macrocyclic analogues can be prepared. Finally, this project will provide an excellent training in modern organic synthesis for the post-doctoral associate who will carry out the work. This will prepare this post-doctoral researcher for a career in academia or in a research or development laboratory in the fine chemicals industry. The pharmaceuticals industry in particular depends on medicinal chemists to design, discover and develop new pharmaceuticals, and very often seeks to recruit experienced synthetic organic chemists for this role. This project will provide an excellent education in this respect. The downstream impact of the training received by the post-doctoral researcher could therefore be very significant indeed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>209019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Since out last report, following the the work undertaken during the last stages of the award more work has been completed on the synthesis of 20,20-difluorinated C17-C27 fragments. Samples of our synthetic compounds have been passed onto life scientists at the Cancer Research Laboratories in the Paterson Institute in Manchester and in Liverpool for investigations into their anticancer activity and binding to PKC receptors since these are believed to be involved in the biological activity of the bryostatins. Initial results indicate that these compounds do have some biological activity but these studies are on-going. We will also be sending some of our compounds to Paul Wender at Stamford who is a leader in this field and who it is fair to say is very helpful in this regard. It is not clear at present whether the biological activities of our compounds will be sufficient to justify further work but at the very least we have opened up this area of investigation in the bryostatin arena.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>40DAEC63-19D7-46E2-9E5F-9F41F0D0AC31</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453863e7fa927.89494459</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Academically this grant was very successful. The first total synthesis of a 20-deoxybryostatin was completed and early results into the preparation of 20,20-difluorobryostatin analogues were successful. This work has opened up the 20-deoxybryostatins to synthetic chemists and has shown that some analogues of the lower C17-C27 fragment themselves can show biological activity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has reached a difficult stage. Our difluorinated analogues are being evaluated for biological activity and for binding to several PKCs, the receptors believed to be involved with some of the anti-cancer activity of the bryostatins. However, we have only been able to complete the synthesis of a few difluorinated compounds to date with five being checked for binding and activity. In the area of structure activity relationships this is really at a very early stage. There are many more compounds we need to prepare to establish properly the influence of the fluorine, and related, substituents on biological activity. However, at the present I am not sure how best to progress this work since no resource is available to me at this time. The work carried out since completion of the grant was financed by my honoraria from editorial work that had been accruing in an account here.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>741A7E71-BA35-4DAA-8CA8-C44B72FE29E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8324f0deaf5.19680383</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>15AB6388-F49E-4ED4-A9AB-6D52A487E913</gtr:id><gtr:title>Total synthesis of 7-des-O-pivaloyl-7-O-benzylbryostatin 10.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic &amp; biomolecular chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd"><gtr:id>704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Green AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-0520</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fedf6997108.45479686</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E382BCB4-6813-4305-8539-7E9FC1433741</gtr:id><gtr:title>Total synthesis of a 20-deoxybryostatin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd"><gtr:id>704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Green AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d730d6dd0d88.51161105</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C353CDA-0024-476A-A864-30C31779E557</gtr:id><gtr:title>Difluoroallylation using a 2-bromomethyl-1,1-difluoroalk-1-ene</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tetrahedron Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb2ba28bd304277514a67c52c6e45e3d"><gtr:id>cb2ba28bd304277514a67c52c6e45e3d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mears P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d730d53675c2.03411605</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D74C0F62-AE1A-4036-900B-D436F8570D1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Syntheses of C17-C27 fragments of 20-deoxybryostatins for assembly using Julia and metathesis reactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic &amp; biomolecular chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2222ab32994179368678f9c1b3a43acd"><gtr:id>2222ab32994179368678f9c1b3a43acd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ball M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-0520</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6b747cd2f57.31447441</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>682FFEB7-F225-4512-A357-57E4F12ACA91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthesis of C16-C27-fragments of bryostatins modified by 20,20-difluorination</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tetrahedron Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb2ba28bd304277514a67c52c6e45e3d"><gtr:id>cb2ba28bd304277514a67c52c6e45e3d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mears P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d730d5615a90.01785906</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>20EA2ED8-A5E8-4344-9601-7A949CC6EE2A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthetic approaches to the C11-C27 fragments of bryostatins.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organic &amp; biomolecular chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd"><gtr:id>704117ff401f6b73efb5369816da37cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Green AP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-0520</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fedef3cc2f7.89967388</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H03255X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
