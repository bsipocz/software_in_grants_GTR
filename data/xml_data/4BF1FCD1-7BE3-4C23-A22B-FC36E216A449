Honesty is important: markets, firms, communities and bureaucracies all work better when the people in them can trust each other. Yet if individuals could often benefit materially from dishonesty, why don't they? One reason is that honesty is a social norm - a rule of behaviour enforced not only by laws, but also informally, by gossip, social sanctions or moral disapproval. 

Recent years have seen a wave of interest in honesty, and norms in general, among social scientists. Experiments have shown that people do not always follow their self-interest; they care too about fairness and equality, for example. They are also very sensitive to other people's expectations, and for this reason will often follow social norms. At the same time, while lab experiments make it easy to study how norms are followed, it is harder to study how they are created. And, because experimental subjects are not typical of the general public, we do not know much about what kinds of families, communities, and institutions successfully encourage honest behaviour.

This is a practically important question. The general public and the government are increasingly concerned with Britain's social fabric, as David Cameron's &amp;quot;broken society&amp;quot; slogan suggests. Honesty and trust are an important part of this issue: they are valuable forms of &amp;quot;social capital&amp;quot; which help people to solve problems together, without central government control. Policy-makers would like to know how to rebuild honesty in our society; teachers and parents want to know how to encourage their pupils and children to be honest; and the public is interested in how serious the problem is and how to fix it.

Finding out how norms works is hard, however. Informal rule enforcement is harder to observe than the formal, legal kind. The process of norm internalization, which leads people to follow social rules even when nobody is looking, is also hard to capture. Interviews and other qualitative research can generate deep insights, but cannot always pin down cause-and-effect relationships. Questionnaires risk measuring &amp;quot;cheap talk&amp;quot;, not real behaviour.

To address these problems, I will use a &amp;quot;behavioural&amp;quot; measure of honesty, which examines choices with real monetary consequences. The sender-receiver game, developed by experimental economists, gives subjects a straight choice between honesty and material self-interest. With it, I will run two related sets of experiments.

First, I will run the sender-receiver game with a representative sample of the British population, from a large panel survey. The resulting measures of honesty will be linked to other survey data, including family and community characteristics, so as to test theories of norm internalization. Respondents, in particular 10-15 year olds, will also be tracked in later waves of the survey, linking honesty with future education, employment and criminal or deviant behaviour.

Second, I will run the sender-receiver game in a school. One important theory holds that norms are spread via friendship networks. The school head has agreed to allow pupils to be randomly allocated into different peer groups (&amp;quot;forms&amp;quot;). By conducting experiments with new pupils, and with the same pupils after one year, I can measure how friendship networks affect honesty, and also how honesty affects friendship networks - do honest pupils gain more friends, and are they more likely to befriend other honest people? The sender-receiver game will be combined with interviews with pupils and school staff, so as to pick up aspects of norm creation which simple experiments cannot capture.

This research will benefit academics and practitioners, including teachers and policy-makers. Project outputs will include academic articles, and a book on honesty aimed at the general public. The research will be publicized via a website, media articles and presentations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research findings will benefit individuals from a range of sectors, including education, policy-makers and policy intellectuals, parents and the general public.

* Educators: teachers, head teachers and school management will gain a better understanding of how peer groups and friendship networks affect adolescents' ethical and personal values, and of how those with different value orientations fare in the long run. This will contribute to the debate on teaching values in schools, as well as on the effects of sorting and streaming. School staff, including both staff from the experiment school and from other schools, will have input into the research design of the project's school experiment. 

* Policy-makers will learn about the distribution of honest behaviour in the British population, and will get practical information on how moral norms are created in society and how they contribute to long-run social outcomes. In particular, the Understanding Society experiments may reveal that honesty is a leading indicator for deviant behaviour at individual or aggregate levels. The Behavioural Insights Team at the Cabinet Office will be interested in my work, and I will use my existing contacts with them to disseminate the research across government.

* Think-tanks such as Demos and the Young Foundation have recently published books on building character in schools (Lexmond and Reeves, 2009; Roberts 2009). Results from the school experiment could help provide rigorous evidence for this agenda. The research will be publicized to these think tanks as well as other interested groups.

* Parents will learn about social, familial and cultural influences on children's character formation. This will help them make informed choices about children's education.

* The general public: there is a continuing public debate on &amp;quot;values&amp;quot;, civility and the social fabric. This research will help to inform that debate. Research outputs such as a &amp;quot;map&amp;quot; of honesty in Britain will offer a compelling story to the mainstream media. Results will be publicized in media articles, as well as via a blog and in a book aimed at the general reader.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>St Nicholas Priory School</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>GY</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D556260-4D22-478C-ADD6-D7D4276F494C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6fb28341e99.88761214-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Working with the school to run experiments with pupils.

Specifically, we looked at fairness norms. When you split up a resource, there are two ways of thinking about what is fair: you can divide the resource equally, or you can give more to people who contributed more to the result. These two alternative fairness norms are the foundation of very different views of society! We examined how young people, between 11 and 15, divided up money earned by competing in a maths test. We found out that they are influenced by their peers - so, social norms spread through social networks at this age. Surprisingly, they were not more influenced by their friends than by other people in their peer group. This suggests that the social influence is a cognitive process, where young people try to work out what they ought to do, rather than a motivational one where they want to behave like their friends.

We've also investigated the norm of honesty. At the moment, our findings are essentially null. There's little evidence that young people's honesty is influenced by their friends. To be certain this is right, we are going to repeat our experiment in a different school.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We're going to find out how and when social norms are passed on in the life course.
