John Bale, Running Cultures, Routledge, 2004, p1\n\nFor 12 years my practice, located in the field of contemporary performance, has focused on ideas of travel, journey and context, often operating across extended timeframes; elements of duration and physical 'endurance' have been central to my work. My other areas of enquiry include performance for public space, the social impact of context-specific performance, and performance and narrative. My practice can be framed as a body-cultural enquiry: the deployment of the human body (often the performer's own) as a catalyst for - and site of - cultural phenomena. Performance art, live art, and specific parts of theatrical, visual and textual practice - contexts my work operates across - can be framed as body-cultural enquiries. \n\nThrough critical examination of my own practice and substantial exposure to the broader field, I have identified a key problematic that has been widely overlooked, perhaps due its apparent utilitarian yet complex nature. As a mode of practical enquiry that deploys the human body as its central site of investigation, the field is yet to undertake serious investigation into an activity that - many argue - defines both the cultural history and the present physical form of the human body: running, more specifically endurance running. The relevance of this problematic is thrown into sharp relief by the neighbouring fields of contemporary biology and anthropology, which for two decades have engaged in research on endurance running, resulting in a near complete rewriting of the socio-cultural place of running and the history of the human body; an event to which body-cultural enquiries in the arts are yet to seriously respond. \n\n'Endurance Running Hypothesis', as proposed by Bramble and Lieberman (University of Utah and Harvard University respectively), frames human survival and the evolution of the human body as products of our ability to run considerable distances, typically between twenty and three hundred miles. The hypothesis is linked to persistence hunting, in which prey is exhausted by being outrun. This is how the light Homo sapiens survived when the heavier Neanderthals did not. We are human, the hypothesis implies, because we ran, and we continue to inhabit the bodies of endurance runners.\n\nA critical question for contemporary performance practice emerges from this hypothesis: how does a body-based field of cultural enquiry, especially one such as mine that specifically approaches ideas of endurance and travel, respond to this framing of the human body as an endurance running body? The question is not whether endurance running can be discussed in terms of being 'art', rather what knowledge can be gained by using endurance running as a mode and site of performance-based research. \n\nThe programme takes my practical investigations as a model and operates across the schools of Arts and Humanities, Biomedical and Health Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering at King's College London. Mentored by Professor of Theatre Alan Read the fellowship will establish creative dialogue between the specialisms of performance studies, literature, biology, biomechanical engineering and anatomical studies. Practical exploration will produce three professional performance outcomes. Discursive and analytical enquiries will inform and review the research through two papers and a seminar series located at the Anatomy Theatre &amp;amp; Museum - a live and 'digital' space for interdisciplinary performance research at King's. The programme's objective is to create a body of practical research on endurance running as a mode and site of performance enquiry that not only contributes to contemporary performance practice's study of endurance, but impacts across the public realm and related academic fields in the arts, humanities and sciences, establishing a performance paradigm of running.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be beneficial to the following 4 key contexts:\n\n1.National and international artists, professionals, professional bodies and academics in the field of contemporary performance practice/research (including performance art, live art and specific parts of theatrical, textual and visual arts practice).

Although endurance - and duration - are both central areas in much body-based practice/research very little emphasis has been placed on our physical relationship to such activities, and no work, to date, has taken place on Endurance Running Hypothesis's reframing of the human body as a running body. Academics in the field of literary/cultural practice and those in biomechanical and anatomical research will benefit from a unique dialogue with a practising artist - creating a valuable investigation into the cultural agency of endurance running. \n\nAll beneficiaries, including the general public, will encounter the research through attending - or by accessing documentatin of - three performance outcomes and by attending - or by accessing online - a series of four seminars. The performance works will take place in public space, engendering public discussion on endurance, journey and travel, health and fitness and the socio-cultural place of endurance running. A seminar and performance event will take place during London's hosting of the Olympic marathon, capitalising on interest in endurance running and ideas of running as public urban spectacle. \n\nThe fellowship will be launched at an evening seminar in King's Anatomy &amp;amp; Theatre Museum. All outcome events - the seminar series and performance works - will be open to academics, related professionals and the general public. Outcomes will be widely publicised; print and e-flyers will be circulated; national media (including specialist running publications and websites) will be notified as will all related e-lists and discussion groups; all national and international beneficiaries listed here will be notified and invited. \n\nThe academic community and the general public will be further engaged through the publication of two research papers; extracts from these are expected to appear in popular running magazines, widening public awareness of the programme. The programme's website will be extensively networked across all relevant academic, performance-based and public/running contexts. The site will carry live broadcast and recorded documentation of both the research processes and its outcomes. \n\nI have a proven track record of delivering performance outcomes and related activities to a wide national and international audience. Past performances works, similar in size and scope to those proposed here, have received live audiences of over 10,000 people per project and have been widely covered by national and international media alongside academic publications/journals and conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220639</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A running-based performance which was undertook as an exercise to produce writing, a text, that mapped both the run (a 50K Ultra Marathon through the wilds of Wiltshire) and the 'run' or the 'course' of my research to date.

The Long Run Fellowship partnered with ANTI Contemporary Art Festival (Kuopio, Finland) to curate and produce a public programme of three performances and one video work- built from, or made in response to, running - by artists All The Queens Men (Australia), Vicki Weitz (UK), Sandra Hall (UK) and Kai Syng Tan and Alan Latham (UK). With a festival audience of over 10,000 the programme had considerable national and international reach and impact, in terms of audiences encountering the work and participating with it; each project had a participatory element, and via its dissemination through online documentation and live streaming. The programme was discussed widely across Finnish broadcast and print media. The programme was curated in collaboration with Kuopio Marathon, the two events ran concurrently, and thus members of the running community also encountered the projects and participated with them, creating a context of dual cultural and sports participation. The impact of the programme, shown across the ANTI Festival week (01/09/15 - 06/09/15) was on a broad public audience apprehending the agency, presence and potentials of running when framed in social and cultural terms and deployed as a creative act.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AF4D1A9E-7715-43C2-A85D-FE052317146B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e09977b4f1e0.43963202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Please note: comments here refer to roughly the first half of the award.

The project's main objective is to create a body of research on endurance running as mode and site of contemporary performance enquiry that will impact on contemporary performance practice, related academic fields, and the public realm. Simply put this means how might distance running be approached in terms of being a 'performance' and what impact might that have on contemporary performance practice, the academic study of running and sports, and performance practices, and the general public. So, three fields of potential impact which in this initial stage of the project were broadly met, notwithstanding the latter - the second stage of the project has seen significant public impact through the curation of a public arts festival focused on the research thesis. At this point, which accounts for activity up until 2014 the most significant achievement of the award was to speak to the contemporary performance community, via a series of seminar/conference presentations and a published paper in a leading academic performance studies journal, and to introduce them to the nascent 'cultural turn' in the apprehension of running. This process led to a number of invitations to speak at further conferences and seminars, pedagogic invitations (looking at how this area of research might be taught in Higher Education) and a number of dialogues with artists that use running in their practice that are ongoing, and will inform later outputs. 

To what extent were the award objectives met? The first two objectives, to impact academically and on the fields of performance practice and study were both met. The ambition for research to have a presence in the public realm was not fully realised during this initially period, this was because the practical work, which was to take place publicly, and based on running (undertaken by myself) was hampered by an element that the project's proposal had somehow overlooked: injury. I sustained a long-term foot injury through 'over-use' as the common phrase has it and was left unable to run for a considerable period while a stress-fracture in a metatarsal heeled, very, very slowly. However, and this is where the narrative will pick up in stage two of the project/Key Findings, it led to perhaps a more impactful public outcome in 2015. Every stressed metatarsal has its upside. 

The key findings have been taken forward by various academics and practitioners, the research has be cited in a number of academic contexts and fields and has led, thanks to an invitation by Dr Kai Syng Tan (Leeds College of Art) and Dr Alan Latham (UCL), to present the research at an event in the summer of 2014, to the co-convening of a multi-discipline research group: Running Cultures Research Group, with with Professor Hayden Lorimer (University of Glasgow), Dr Jennifer Lea (University of Exeter), Dr Alan Latham (University College London), Dr Kai Syng Tan (Leeds College of Art) and Dr Andrew Filmer (Aberystwyth University).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through various modes of dissemination, conference presentations, publication etc. the findings for this period of the fellowship (which is ongoing, until Feb 2017) have been used and discussed by a number of academics and performance makers. Academics from the fields of Cultural Geography, Human Geography and Performance and Theatre Studies have all actively engaged with the research, as have a number of performance makers - chiefly through my curation of a set of four international 'running-performances' at the 2015 ANTI Contemporary Art Festival, Kuopio, Finland.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>08E9194F-F2E2-47CA-8C76-3A5F79CF7081</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df46755b6df4.22082350</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D05CC2B1-B2ED-4A94-A290-3812C7EC378E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performing from the Back of the Pack: Endurance Running, Performance and Humanness</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b"><gtr:id>6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whelan, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54635a18440b06.30166099</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4ED30CF-106E-482F-A066-C77D923E739D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Long Run: An Introduction</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research Seminar, King's College London</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b"><gtr:id>6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whelan, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54648f6d0d30c6.06354786</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5FA4F609-6893-4B8F-B51E-61EBCCEFB8C6</gtr:id><gtr:title>What I Run About When I Run About Running</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b"><gtr:id>6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whelan, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546357926112a9.25757114</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D2BADB4-F5E2-4C35-B138-31E686D8A3CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research Seminar: What I Run About When I Run About Running. 0.1</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research Seminar, Aberystwyth University</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b"><gtr:id>6cf7f22f6619e6b8c52a4d87e0682a4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whelan, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54648ecb1beb09.03193062</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D71CB80-6385-4BF3-80E4-5AA679ECA24A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Amateur Human: Seeing Running.
