factor beta (TGF beta) family of proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), control multiple cellular processes, which regulate cell fate. Their malfunctions cause human disorders ranging from bone defects to cancer progression and metastasis. When cells are exposed to TGF beta, another family of proteins, called SMADs, become activated, which then transmit the TGF beta signals by affecting the expression of hundreds of genes, leading to, among other things, a halt to the growth of the cells. Many cancer cells overcome the growth inhibitory effects of TGF beta, but at the same time start producing TGF beta and other factors, which block the growth of normal cells, including immune cells, thereby making these cancer cells resistant to immune surveillance and promoting their metastatic invasion.||We are interested in understanding how the TGF beta and BMP signalling pathways are regulated in cells, from initiation of the signals until their termination. The activity of SMAD proteins, the mediators of the TGF beta and BMP signals, is balanced by pathway crosstalk and feedback inputs through multiple signalling pathways. We are interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which the activity, stability and fate of SMAD proteins is modulated by inputs from other signalling pathways, especially in the context of human diseases, including bone diseases and cancer. A better understanding of these mechanisms may provide novel therapeutic targets and better treatment strategies against these diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The TGF beta family of ligands, including BMP, control multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation, recognition, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell fate and their malfunctions cause human disorders ranging from bone defects to cancer progression and metastasis. Smad proteins transduce BMP and TGF beta signals upon phosphorylation of their C-terminal SXS motif by receptor kinases, leading to their interaction with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus, where they regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. The activity of Smad1/5/8 in the BMP pathway and Smad2/3 in the TGF beta pathway is regulated by pathway crosstalk and feedback inputs through multiple signalling pathways. We are interested in elucidating molecular mechanisms by which TGF beta and BMP signalling networks are modulated by inputs from other signalling pathways, especially in the context of development and human diseases, including bone diseases and cancer. The specific research objectives currently being undertaken are as follows:||1. Integration of signalling networks at the level of Smads: Much is known about individual linear signalling pathways downstream of specific hormones, growth factors and cytokines. In the context of complex cellular processes and disease, multiple signalling networks are at play and it is this interplay that determines the outcome in a given context. We are interested in addressing how different signalling inputs affect the outcome of BMP/TGF beta signalling. By employing proteomic approaches, we aim to identify novel interacting partners for Smad proteins downstream of different factors in different biological contexts. Preliminary experiments have resulted in the identification of some novel Smad-interacting proteins as well as some established Smad-interacting partners. We will also identify modifications introduced by specific factors within the Smad proteins or their interacting partners. Extensive functional tests on novel interacting partners will be performed using cell-based assays including stem cells, in a developmental context using Xenopus embryos, in mice using targeted gene disruption strategies and in relevant human disease models.||2. Regulation of Smad dephosphorylation and termination of Smad signalling: Dephosphorylation and recycling of activated Smads is an integral part of TGF beta signalling and critical for agonist sensing by the cell. We identified and characterized the SCP family of nuclear phosphatases as mediators of Smad1-tail dephosphorylation in the BMP signalling pathway as well as linker regions of Smad1 and Smad2/3. In addition to SCPs as Smad1-tail and Smad1/2/3-linker phosphatases, PPM1A and PDP have been reported as Smad1/2 phosphatases. The precise molecular details of exactly when, where, how, and by which phosphatase, the dephosphorylation of Smads takes place is still unresolved. Most phosphatases have multiple substrates and depend on cofactors to define specificity towards individual substrates. We are interested in identifying rate-limiting factors for some of these phosphatases. SCP2 is overexpressed in numerous sarcomas as well as brain tumours. We will investigate whether the overexpression is linked to deregulation of BMP signalling in these cancers or derivative cell lines and will also determine what effect, if any, knocking down SCP2 in these cells has on their proliferation rates, migration and BMP signalling.||3. Regulation of Smad stability by ubiquitination: Smurf1 is dependent on linker phosphorylation of proline-directed sites to recognize and ubiquitinate Smad1. We are interested in resolving the molecular basis and determinants of this interaction. In addition we are interested in identifying novel substrates for Smurf1/2 based on their substrate recognition by phosphorylation of substrates at proline-directed sites, in addition to the presence of the classical PY motifs. Aberrant Smurf1/2 action has been reported in pancreatic cancer, which is also m</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1445943</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Molecular mechanisms of TGF-beta and BMP signalling</gtr:description><gtr:id>D26B5946-35A6-45F5-B539-A25896ADE528</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have had two publications, as follows:

The collaboration led the Unit to develop the technology of protein kinase profiling which has developed into an industry worth over &amp;pound;100 million per annum. It also led to the creation of the European Division of Upstate Incorporated in Dundee which currently employs about 50 people. The Unit's first publication on protein kinase profiling was named in 2009 by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia as Europe's most cited paper in the field of Cel Biology from 1996-2007, with over 2,200 citations. During the collaboration, the Unit has filed 36 patents and 30 licenses have been taken up by the pharmaceutical industry. The DSTT is widely regarded as a model of how academia and industry should interact for which it received a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher Education which was presented by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace in February 2006.
GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d055167dab51.24324538-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Benefits from DSTT collaboration
The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy. From July 2003 to July 2008, the participating pharmaceutical companies were AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co, Merck-Serono and Pfizer. The collaboration was renewed for a further four years in July 2008 with five of these companies (Merck and Co leaving the consortium at this time). This collaboration was renewed for an unprecedented fourth time in July 2013 for a further four years with six pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Janessen Pharmaceutica), Merck-Serono and Pfizer.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

From July 2003 to July 2008, the participating pharmaceutical companies were AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co, Merck-Serono and Pfizer. The collaboration was renewed for a further four years in July 2008 with five of these companies (Merck and Co leaving the consortium at this time). This collaboration was renewed for an unprecedented fourth time in July 2013 for a further four years with six pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Janessen Pharmaceutica), Merck-Serono and Pfizer. Each of the six companies pays &amp;pound;600000 per annum over the four year period. The aim of the collaboration is to help the pharmaceutical companies accelerate the development of drugs that inhibit protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases with therapeutic potential for the treatment of disease.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

She observed and participated in the research work undertaken in the laboratory. As part of her assessment, she wrote an essay on her experience working in a cancer-research laboratory and will also be making a presentation before her class when she returns to her school.

The hope is her experience will encourage her and other students to demonstrate active interest in science and medical research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>bsj6QqKz5HG</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Judging a High School debate on Public Health, Stirling, Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25208E1C-A28E-4641-A69B-522BF73F423B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The debate was about government regulation of public health participated by two High schools. The audience was primarily students, but also included members of the public. In my role as a judge, using my research as an example, I was able to highlight the importance of the contribution of basic research in formulating sound healthcare policies to the debators, the audience and the other judges. The other judges represented a wide areas of expertise (a BBC Radio Broadcast producer, an architecht and a retired University Lecturer among others).

Some of the pupils enquired about what it takes to pursue a career in research. Several other people attending the event asked questions on what types of research were being carried out to fight cancer.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>qbduiohgoJF</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Forthill Primary School Science Outreach</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAD253C9-36AC-46F3-BDA4-A15C0DBB349B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Scientists and support staff from the MRC PPU recently enjoyed a visit with a P3 class at Forthill Primary for a fun morning of hands on experiments.

There was plenty of loud vocal appreciation from the children and assurances from many that scientist is now their primary career choice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5420467174a619.52345492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Judge at High School Debate on Health Issues (through Debating Matters)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9964EBE0-B855-4A99-9E11-8C74A65A1F20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Debate attendance ranged from 20-50 students and teachers.
