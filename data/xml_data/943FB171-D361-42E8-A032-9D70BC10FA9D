For many people the currently available treatments do not adequately control their symptoms. There is evidence that a process called oxidative stress is important in this condition. Oxidative stress is a process when there are too many very reactive molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) for the body to deal with, and they cause damage to the proteins and DNA inside cells. There are higher concentrations of these molecules produced in the airway of patients with asthma, and these can exacerbate inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Pulmonary fibrosis is another lung disease where ROS are thought to be involved in damaging the lung tissue, and abnormal healing following this damage may result in scarring of the lungs, preventing them from functioning properly.

Mast cells are a type of cell that can cause inflammation by releasing chemicals in diseases such as anaphylaxis (a very severe and dangerous allergic reaction), asthma, rhinitis and eczema. These chemicals cause some of the symptoms of allergic diseases such as wheezing, excessive mucus, runny noses, and swelling of tissues. Mast cells also contribute to lung fibrosis. It has been found that ROS are produced in the process leading to release of chemicals by mast cells, and that using drugs that reduce ROS production might reduce the release of these chemicals; this could help to treat the symptoms of allergy and asthma, and also lung fibrosis. 

Although we know that there is probably too much ROS production in asthma, ROS also have important functions in normal healthy cells and tissues, and inhibiting them might also cause some unhelpful side effects too. That is why we believe it is important to investigate what regulates the production of ROS in inflammatory cells, particularly in mast cells, to help us develop new, effective and safe therapies, including for allergic conditions and fibrosis.

In order for cells to be respond appropriately to oxidative stress and possibly regulate ROS production they need to be able to tell if there are too many ROS being produced; they need to be able to sense the presence of oxidative stress. Some proteins called transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are able to do this, and we have preliminary evidence from work performed in our lab, that they may be operating in mast cells from human lungs. We believe that they may be able to regulate human lung mast cell function, the production of ROS, as well as mediating both beneficial and detrimental cell activities in response to oxidative stress. Our research is aimed at testing these ideas to help develop better treatments for lung diseases that involve mast cells and oxidative stress including asthma and pulmonary fibrosis.

My goals are to investigate how these channels are involved in mast cell function, including whether they can promote or reduce mast cell activation (mast cells are overactive in some diseases) in conditions of oxidative stress. I will also investigate whether the number of these channels in the bronchial tubes of patients with asthma is different to people without asthma.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mast cell dependent lung diseases including asthma, acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. An interaction between oxidative stress and mast cells is an important pathologic event. Although oxidative stress can result from prolonged excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ROS are also recognised to play roles in normal physiology. Therapies that directly but non-specifically target oxidative stress have failed in clinical trials, perhaps because of interference with physiological ROS signalling and regulatory mechanisms. 
 
We hypothesise that the redox-sensitive TRP channels TRPA1 and TRPM2 function as sensors of oxidant-antioxidant balance in human lung mast cells (HLMC), and participate in regulating intracellular ROS production and Ca2+ signalling. We predict that the regulation of responses to OS by TRP channels in HLMCs is determined by the stimulus duration and intensity, and is important in the pathophysiology of mast cell-driven lung diseases. I have preliminary evidence for the functional expression of these channels in HLMCs. My goals are to delineate the role of these channels in HLMC activation in conditions of OS, using patch-clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging and mediator assays; and ROS production using fluorescent ROS indicators. I also aim to determine whether tissue expression of these channels in human bronchial biopsies is altered in asthma using immunohistochemistry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate direct beneficiaries of the project will include research groups with interests in the allergy, asthma, oxidative stress and TRP ion channels. It will also directly benefit the pharmaceutical industry by increasing knowledge about the effects of molecules developed to antagonise TRPM2 and TRPA1 in our models of human mast cell-mediated disease. The ultimate aim is for the research to enable the development of novel therapies for mast cell and oxidative stress mediated disease for the benefit of patients and the physicians treating them. A wider range of patients with oxidative stress associated disease may benefit in the longer term. It may also eventually benefit industry developing and manufacturing biomarkers for oxidative stress. Indirectly it may influence policy internationally about environmental exposure to oxidants in pollution, given it may add weight to the argument that oxidants in pollution are directly responsible for the growing burden of airways disease.

Our model testing the effect of TRPA1 and TRPM2 blocking molecules at different doses and durations of oxidant stress may alter the paradigm by which future studies investigating therapeutics targeting oxidative stress are performed. This may have wide reaching implications for many research groups but it could also lead to changes in the way pharmaceuticals targeting oxidative stress mechanisms are developed. It may elucidate new applications for existing biomarkers of oxidative stress or lend weight to the search for new markers. This could result in a significant benefit to industry based in the UK and internationally.

Ultimately the molecules may be used to improve the symptoms of asthma and other mast cell mediated lung diseases in patients in 5 to 10 years. It may result in the development of methods to more suitably target patents for therapies over a similar time scale. This may also result in a re-evaluation of existing therapies according to existing or novel biomarkers. Ultimately the increased understanding of the regulation of oxidant balance and oxidant stress may be invaluable for developing treatments for a very wide range of patients. For example pharmacological manipulation of redox sensitive TRP channels may alter tumour sensitivity to oxidative stress - our research could benefit the development of such therapies. This could result in therapies to make tumours more sensitive to radiotherapy for example for the benefit of patients with solid tumours.

Overall, we believe that the identification of novel therapeutic molecules to combat lung diseases will enhance the competitiveness of UK science by proposing novel treatment alternatives for patients and offering commercial possibilities to the pharmaceutical and biomarkers industry. We believe that this potential can be realised within 5-10 years from the start of the work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196868</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N02074X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
