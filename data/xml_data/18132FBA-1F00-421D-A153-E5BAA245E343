Conventional laser sources for these applications are complex and inefficient whereas a direct blue laser diode source could offer many advantages such as increased power, lower complexity, and smaller size, potentially transforming quantum sensors such as frequency standards from laboratory instruments into miniaturised, robust devices. The project will consist of two cycles of laser design, fabrication and test, in which we will optimise key laser parameters including linewidth and power. The project will be led by CSTG Ltd in partnership with the University of Glasgow and Aston University.'</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project very well supports the EPSRC request to develop of Novel Technologies to support the needs of crossdisciplinary science and engineering in the 21st. This proposal is for a project within the TSB Technology-Inspired Collaborative R&amp;amp;D programme. The main beneficiary of the research project is therefore expected, and in fact required, to be the company that is the lead partner within the collaboration, i.e. CST Global Ltd. (CSTG). We will develop and test novel advanced photonics devices and technologies (here through the development of next generation of GaN lasers emitting in the blue spectral region), which would then lead to a potential new product line for CSTG Ltd. Our research and advances will benefit researchers in the fields of laser science, quantum sensors and bio-medical photonics. We anticipate that our research on new underlying laser technologies for a range of laser cooling and medical applications will contribute knowledge to the general field of photonics leading the way other UK and worldwide photonics groups into the new areas of high impact practical exploitation of laser and optical sensing technologies.
Beyond the academic impact our project will contribute to practical implementation of new technologies for important applications such as quantum sensors and biomedical applications. The project will develop advanced compact laser sources that will be tested by the end users and will move directly into the practical area.
The project work plan includes all necessary actions in order to deliver the short and medium term impacts.
Research and technology development core will cover a range of investigation topics starting from laser development.
Already at this stage the project will deliver several visible impacts which will set an agenda for future research in this field in UK and worldwide.
Focus on practical quantum sensors applications will allow developing a set of photonics devices and technologies.
Full range of measures to deliver the impact will allow spreading the technology transfer to relevant end users, by use of diverse tools from traditional dissemination like publications and dedicated project website to more targeted knowledge transfer actions though collaborative links.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32266</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R043280/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
