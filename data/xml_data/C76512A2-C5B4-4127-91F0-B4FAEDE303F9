Assuming the terms of their own self-description, these self-determining communities and their respective chanceries have been presented as champions of the twin-virtues of liberty and civic participation in the face of the tyrannical and imperialistic ambitions of would-be oppressors and, consequently, as central to the emergence of modern liberalism and western notions of state. Such assumptions underpin the historiography of republican political thought from Hans Baron's classic 'The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance: civic humanism and republican liberty in the age of classicism and tyranny' (1955) to JGA Pocock's 'The Machiavellian Moment: Florentine Political Thought and the Atlantic Republican Tradition' (1975) and Quentin Skinner's 'The Foundations of Modern Political Thought' (1978). These texts were instrumental in cementing the significance of republican and neo-Roman political writing to modern ideas of the state as well as testifying to the new method of the so-called 'Cambridge School' which championed a mode of writing about the history of political thought which became known as 'contextualism' due to its concern to place texts, understood as situated speech acts, in contexts.\nThe current project seeks to radically critique both the representation of this republican tradition and the methodology which underpins its articulation by throwing into perspective the exclusive focus placed on the consensual dimension of this form of social ordering and the privileging granted to concepts of liberty and civic participation. Starting with an examination of the reception of the controversially inflected classical civic arts in late medieval Italy, the study shows how conflict and opposition were the basis of forensic, deliberative and demonstrative rhetoric. When turned outwards in self-defence against shared enemies such rhetorics served to bind communities closer together yet significantly when turned inwards they supplied the tools for verbal conflict, stigmatization and exclusion. The aim is to direct attention to the manner in which much speech activity took place outside the legitimating institutions of the communal law courts, civic assemblies and ritual public performances and the manner in which those in authority sought to control wayward or threatening speech. The tension between control and evasion is charted by examining the circulation of the word in the verbal economy of late medieval and Renaissance Florence, and by placing the various types of speech act in their performance contexts within the city's fabric rather than in the context of their literary or linguistic registers. Through examining the interrelation between speech, place and authority this study focuses on the neglected rhetorical tradition of dissensus and subjugation within the republican tradition, arguing that the rhetoric of communal political imagination in late medieval and Renaissance Florence, in having no means of conceptualizing legitimate opposition or tolerating party politics, was resolutely pre-modern. As such it questions the notion of an unbroken civic republican genealogy in a manner which simultaneously questions the moral superiority of western notions of the liberal democratic state. In focusing attention on the partiality of all political rhetorics it shows how those denied an active political 'part' or voice found solace in different registers and literary forms, from the discourses of medieval consolation literature, as practiced by Boccaccio, to the spectral community of Dante-exile's speaking ghosts. All bear witness to the limits placed on both participation and on liberty by those in authority who, in holding the literal and metaphorical high ground, could silence those who spoke out of place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I will pursue two main avenues to ensure that my research findings benefit a broader audience both within the Academy and beyond.\n\nIn terms of media coverage, the critique of the linear narrative of Atlantic Republicanism and the focus on the oppressive strand within its rhetoric provides an innovative historical perspective on what has been characterised by recent political commentators as the 'grammar of hostility' and 'impulse towards polarization' that has become such a concern in debates over the fragmentation of community, especially in America. Similarly, in demonstrating the genealogy of the process whereby the stereotyping of a threatening Other can serve to reinforce the identificatory boundaries of political forms my work addresses contemporary political rhetorics and their discourses of inclusion and exclusion.\n\nSuch critical readings can help set contemporary preoccupations in perspective and inform future thinking, both ideologically and in policy terms. I would seek to place position pieces with political commentary publications such as The Spectator and New Statesman. I would also explore other public dissemination possibilities in conjunction with the University's Press Office. I also intend to explore the publication of a pamphlet under the auspices of a think tank such as the Adam Smith Institute, CentreForum, or Fabian Society along the lines of Bruce Holsinger's 'Neomedievalism, Neoconservatism, and the War on Terror' (2007) published by Prickly Paradigm Press. The historical perspective offered by my work should also appeal to ResPublica, a non governmental think tank concerned with the revival of civic communitarianism.\n\nIn terms of the wider academic community both within and beyond the UK, I am seeking to establish a collaborative network, for which funding is being sought from the ESF, on 'The State, Language and Power' which aims to bring together political and social scientists with historians of political thought to evaluate the place and space of voice within contemporary political discourse to coincide with the five hundredth anniversary in 2013 of the writing of Machiavelli's 'The Prince' (a text I translated and edited for Everyman). Negotiations are currently underway to stage an exhibition centred on the text and its legacy at the John Rylands Library at Deansgate in Manchester drawing specifically on the library's special collections of political tracts.\n\nAs Chair of Italian I have worked with the Friends of the John Rylands Library and given a number of public lectures, including 'Dante in Manchester' and 'Manufacturing the Renaissance', which charted the accession of parts of the library's collection in examining the history of Manchester's self-description in the Victorian period as the Florence of the North, combining trade, learning and the arts in the process of civic regeneration.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>60 minute BBC documentary in the 'Imagine' series with Alan Yentob</gtr:description><gtr:id>67F8C747-FC65-4624-9401-952E178D84FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 50K views on YouTube alone of this documentary which has become widely used in UG teaching across UK and worldwide</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6e0603b722.50589610</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Who's Afraid of Machiavelli</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fphTuyJXTcQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Short video showcasing the activities organised in Manchester in 2013 to celebrate the 700th anniversary of Boccaccio's birth in 1313.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9B78DBA4-B63A-427E-B96D-60BD7B025D5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Video used in UG teaching and will be uploaded/attached to the on-line e-journal Heliotropia which will contain the proceedings of the 2013 conference</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd70fa8587e9.20633220</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Locating Boccaccio in 2013</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdGWeD1oLkA</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>5-month exhibition held at John Rylands Library, Manchester, July-November 2013 showcasing manuscript and early printed editions of Boccaccio's works from the Rylands collection and beyond.

In addition, the work undertaken on town criers in Renaissance Florence, led to an historical reconstruction of the reading of the proclamation for Machiavelli's capture on the 500th anniversary of the event itself through the streets of Florence. International news and TV coverage and crowd of c.500 participated.

The documents also featured in an exhibition at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence between December 2013 and April 2014.
I was invited to participate/attend the World Town Crier Championships in Chester in summer 2014 and appeared in the Winter 2013 edition of the Guild of Town Crier's journal 'The Crier'.

In terms of communicating my research findings to the academic community, I have given eleven invited papers between Feb.2012 and December 2013 in the UK, USA, China and Italy and two conference papers in Florence and San Diego. For the paper given at NYU see link below

The new findings on rhetorical miscellanies and their translation into the new media of print has been presented in papers given at the RSA conference in San Diego (as part of the ERC 'Italian Voices 1450-1600' project), at All Soul's, the John Rylands, UPenn and the Harvard Centre for Italian Renaissance Studies, Villa I Tatti, Florence. A chapter is currently under preparation for an edited volume arising from the RSA sessions.
In terms of new research findings, during my archival research on the figure of the Florentine town crier, I discovered new documentation relating to Machiavelli's arrest and imprisonment, events that fundamentally conditioned his authorship of The Prince. The 500th anniversary of the first drafting of this text fell in 2013, so these discoveries were greeted with considerable academic and public interest. I approached the Hon. Valdo Spini, former Italian Minister for the Environment and chair of the Florentine committee tasked with marking the anniversary, and suggested an historical reconstruction of the reading of the proclamation 500 years to the day, using the original text and tracing the town crier's route as identified during my research. This took place in February 2013 and has resulted in extensive media work and public engagement activities (see links listed below).
In terms of research-related collaborations, I have established links at Tianjin Normal and Shanghai Normal universities as a result of an invitation to China as part of a group of international Machiavelli experts from Italy, USA and Canada to celebrate the publication of Machiavelli's complete works into Chinese. I participated in a series of workshops and public lectures in both cities in May 2013. I also participated in an international Machiavelli workshop organized by the Department of History at Havard (December 2013).
As regards new skills developed as a result of the fellowship, I am now far more conversant with the protocols of dealing with national and international media organisations in conjunction with institutional press offices and of the potential for public engagement in disseminating the results of research activity. In terms of the impact and knowledge transfer agenda, I am better skilled at capturing my research through social media and using the web to disseminate findings, bringing my work to a wider audience and including the results in my UG and PG teaching. The article published in 2013 on the Florentine town criers has a live link to a film of the reconstruction, the first time I have combined media in this way in my published output. I am far better versed in how to collate quantitative data and metrics for impact purposes and now co-author a blog on another project as a result of my experiences which has had over 8K views from 55 countries in the last 8 months (http://manutiusinmanchester.wordpress.com). There is no doubt in my mind that the experiences gleaned have redefined my ideas concerning the communication of humanities research and the need to identify multiple audiences in the targeting and planning of research activity in a more holistic fashion. Since my fellowship I have been involved in curating two five-month public exhibitions with associated publications, schools outreach activity and the production of on-line heritage material.
As regards published outputs produced on the basis of work undertaken during the fellowship period, I have completed x4 articles and book chapters (total words 34K), given fourteen papers by invitation and at conferences around the world, and made numerous media appearances and a BBC documentary (selected links listed below).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To date my findings have been used in education and public media for both academic and non-academic audiences. The BBC documentary which I helped devise and in which I appear, to explain my findings on the context of Machiavelli's authorship of the Prince and the reception of his work over 500 years, has been used in numerous undergraduate courses in the UK and North America and was showcased at the workshops at Harvard and in Tianjin Normal and Shanghai Normal China (see link above). Subsequent to that programme and the international news coverage which came in the wake of the historical reconstruction through the streets of Florence on the 500th anniversary of the proclamations' reading, I have been invited to give numerous papers around the world, contribute to conferences and also establish working links with the UK Guild of Town Criers, whose hosting of the World Championships I attend in Chester in August 2014. The University of Manchester's Press Office has helped handle press interest and manage press releases around this activity.
I also held a public outreach event at the John Rylands Library, showcasing early printed editions of Machiavelli's text and undertook public lectures on the topic in Florence (Bargello Museum: Feb. 2013) and in Dublin (UCD Public Lecture: Oct. 2013).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0153135C-4F1E-45F8-988F-465B18AC8B51</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649e408cc5c1.88444402</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMkt1Vq7tJ4</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7D193684-8EE4-4AE8-BE12-00FBB3D2965F</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Fanno bandire, notificare, et expressamente comandare&amp;quot;: Town Criers and the Information Economy of Renaissance Florence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>I Tatti Studies in the Italian Renaissance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d047cc8266374ca092e09019291ced3f"><gtr:id>d047cc8266374ca092e09019291ced3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545bd423bcdc79.76796956</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0EBE2B9D-DB23-4AFB-9532-E00681879E9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emotions, Passions and Power in Renaissance Italy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/202bdad6413191f70f4737f70b8e17a2"><gtr:id>202bdad6413191f70f4737f70b8e17a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner S J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9789089647368</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545bd5e1362222.16799016</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BF8B03DA-8EE8-4F85-A14A-E9CCE3D46486</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Medici: Citizens and Masters</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/40f45780c410c0199dbd709d1c5d728f"><gtr:id>40f45780c410c0199dbd709d1c5d728f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780674088443</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6bb9804c49.83727428</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F4B7103F-CDBA-4B66-A3FC-395F9E90381D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Cambridge Companion to Boccaccio</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d047cc8266374ca092e09019291ced3f"><gtr:id>d047cc8266374ca092e09019291ced3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781139013987</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545bd84bd89943.21313134</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB347C89-38A6-48F2-A133-1DE04A0F3FB8</gtr:id><gtr:title>War and Peace in Dante</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/202bdad6413191f70f4737f70b8e17a2"><gtr:id>202bdad6413191f70f4737f70b8e17a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milner S J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781846824203</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545bd7400a9395.01278677</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I004173/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7378EED-C28D-4F1E-9E28-5D9E75964912</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Italian studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
