of Civil Engineering Structures</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K023047/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Structural health monitoring (SHM) of civil engineering structures (buildings, bridges, wind turbines, dams, masts etc) aims to assess their structural integrity and performance and to detect potential damage induced by i) daily service loads, ii) exposure to environmental effects over the years and/or iii) extreme/accidental loads, either natural (e.g. floods, hurricanes and earthquakes) or man-made (e.g. explosions and traffic accidents). 
As identified in the UK's 2011 National Infrastructure Plan, investing in civil infrastructure is a key priority to achieve Nation-wide financial growth and prosperity, a statement which applies globally. Developing new SHM tools to facilitate better informed decisions by civil infrastructure owners, local authorities, National agencies, and Governments on taking refurbishment, retrofitting, upgrade, or replacement actions for existing infrastructure is of utmost importance to appropriately channel investments in civil infrastructure. 

In this context, the proposed research considers concepts from the emerging field of compressive sensing (CS) to develop novel structural condition assessment and damage detection algorithms for vibration-based SHM of civil engineering structures. These SHM algorithms support the use of arrays of sensors incorporating CS-based data acquisition hardware equipment which has not been considered before in wireless SHM of civil engineering structures. Such equipment is not commercially available yet, but the few existing prototypes showcase that it yields simpler, more affordable, and less obtrusive sensors. Therefore, this project paves the way for transformative technological advancements towards a new breed of wireless sensors enabling i) cost-effective routine/periodic SHM for ageing infrastructure, and ii) rapid integrity assessment of large number of structures in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Structural health monitoring (SHM) of civil engineering structures (buildings, bridges, wind turbines, dams, masts etc) aims to assess their structural integrity and performance and to detect potential damage induced by i) daily service loads, ii) exposure to environmental effects over the years and/or iii) extreme/accidental loads, either natural (e.g. floods, hurricanes and earthquakes) or man-made (e.g. explosions and traffic accidents). 
As identified in the UK's 2011 National Infrastructure Plan, investing in civil infrastructure is a key priority to achieve Nation-wide financial growth and prosperity, a statement which applies globally. In the same document, an estimated pipeline of planned investment in UK infrastructure worth over &amp;pound;250 billion between 2011 and 2015 is announced by the Government. Developing new SHM tools to facilitate better informed decisions by civil infrastructure owners, local authorities, National agencies, and Governments on taking refurbishment, retrofitting, upgrade, or replacement actions for existing infrastructure is of utmost importance to appropriately channel such investments. 

The novel SHM algorithms to be developed in this research support the use of arrays of sensors incorporating compressive sensing-based (CS-based) hardware equipment, addressed for the first time in wireless SHM of civil engineering structures. Such equipment is not commercially available yet, but the few existing prototypes showcase that it yields simpler, more affordable, and less obtrusive sensors. Further, the proposed algorithms are tailored to minimise energy consumption at these sensors. Thus, the need for energy harvesting and/or frequent battery replacement and consequently the overall cost for their deployment and maintenance is reduced. Therefore, this project, though theoretical and computational in nature, paves the way for transformative technological advancements towards a new breed of wireless sensors enabling i) cost-effective routine/eriodic SHM for ageing infrastructure and ii) rapid integrity assessment of large number of structures in the aftermath of natural disasters. Consecutively, owners of infrastructure will benefit as SHM will add value to their assets and reduce insurance costs, since health and safety issues will be better addressed, with the level of structural integrity of instrumented structures being in any case readily assessed. 

To this end, the proposed research will spark, in short term, considerable new technological R&amp;amp;D and commercialisation opportunities for national and international specialised instrumentation companies and electric equipment manufacturers to address the global market needs for cost-effective, mobile, and prompt SHM solutions relying on CS-based sensors. This is a growing global market as the inventory of infrastructure and their rate of decay due to climate change increase world-wide. 

Further, this new CS-based technology might influence policy makers setting frameworks for the periodic inspection regimes of the large stock of decaying infrastructure. For example, there are almost 600,000 bridges in the US Highway system, which have been rated with a &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; by the American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 2009. UK's inventory of bridges is in better shape at the moment, rated as &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; by the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) in 2009. However, Highways Agency spends about &amp;pound;800million per year for maintenance. A portion of it concerns routine visual bridge inspections undertaken every second year which can be quite subjective. Adopting wireless CS-based sensors for routine SHM inspections in the case of highway bridges may offer a better option for early warnings of structural underperformance and/or deterioration in order to avoid collapse of structures (e.g. I-35W Minneapolis bridge, USA) and operation disruptions of lifelines (e.g. closure of M4 in West London in July 2012), at a reasonable additional annual cost.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Technical University of Athens, Greece</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Greece, Hellenic Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Vamvatsikos</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACF16EFC-144D-4220-BC4B-16EA0D293DA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>doi: 10.1061/9780784413609.171

Still, the algorithms developed and tested numerically during the project sparkled signficant interest within the health moniroting community for civil engineering structures. In one instance (2016), the algorithms have been shown to be more effective in terms of data transmission reduction and in sensor energy consumption compared to competeing compressive sensing algorithms developed by other international research groups by considering field recorded data from the B&amp;auml;renbohlstrasse bridge in Zurich, Switzerland. In another instance (2017), the developed algorithms showed to be more effective for the monitoring a specific on-shore wind turbine in Germany using 20% fewer measurements than any other compressive sensing based algorithm for structural health monitoring proposed in the literature. It is expected that these recent outcomes will facilitate impact to the economy and society in following years through the engagement of specialised companies /manufacturers of sensors for monitoring of civil engineering structures.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>95813119-938A-4EFE-BEDF-64C351F901A7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb1043ec8cc9.24177834</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research project pursued the mathematical/analytical development, the numerical implementation and the testing of compressive sensing-based algorithms for framework for structural health monitoring focusing on large-scale civil engineering structures.

A data-bank of simulation-based vibration response signals of benchmark structures pertaining to a healthy/intact and various damaged states has been constructed The thus derived signals are expanded to various wavelet bases of different frequency domain attributes, with the scope of: (i) estimating the best (sparsest) representation of the considered vibration response signals within the adopted wavelet domains; (ii) assessing the influence of the frequency domain attributes of wavelet analysis filter banks; (iii) achieving vibration-based structural damage detection and localization from changes in the energy distribution of structural response signals along the frequency domain; and (iv) providing practical recommendations on the computation of the considered damage indices associated with the suitability of the wavelet family used, the adopted excitation force, the type of the regarded structural system and the time-evolving characteristics of the assumed structural damage.

Novel algorithms for vibration-based structural health monitoring (V-SHM) of civil engineering structures in operational conditions, which are dynamically vibrating under ambient forces, such as wind and traffic. The developed approach devises smart routines (i.e., sub-Nyquist multi-coset sampling fused with power spectrum estimation techniques) of reduced computational payloads, being capable to identify the structural dynamic characteristics (i.e., natural frequencies, mode shapes) and detect the location of structural damage from a significantly reduced number of measurements, compared to current practices. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be regarded as a strong candidate for battery-operated wireless sensors of reduced data transmissions resulting in significant savings in power consumptions while reducing the hardware size and complexity. The proposed approach has been numerically tested with field recorded data pertaining to an existing bridge in Zurich, Switzerland. Further, the developed approach has been compared vis-a-vis other advanced methods for energy-efficient wireless sensor networks, WSNs, (i.e., Compressive Sensing based WSNs for Structural Health Monitoring) and it has been numerically proved that the proposed method is more efficient on the following grounds: (1) it can be applied to signals of any structure without imposing any further constraints (i.e., it is a signal-agnostic method); (2) it not significantly affected by additive noise encounted in practical applications; (3) it entails fewer processing steps, being in general, computationally more efficient; (4) structural modal properties are retrieved with high accuracy for high signal compression levels at which the other advanced approaches fail; (5) the above advantages can reduce further the power consumption, computational demands, memory and storage requirements prior to wireless data transmission. Bases on technical specifications of a commercially available low-power wireless sensor, the energy consumption associated the developed approach has been numerically evaluated, highlighting the direct impact it has on savings in sensor's battery life (journal paper under preparation). For a broader perspective, further research is pursued towards the comparison between the proposed methodology and new approaches in the current state-of-the-art for low-power WSNs (conference paper under preparation-abstract accepted). 

Novel cost-effective V-SHM damage detection approach were developed which combines pseudo-spectrum estimation methods (i.e., the &amp;quot;super-resolution&amp;quot; multiple signal classification -MUSIC- algorithm) with smart sampling strategies ( i.e., co-prime sampling) aiming to reduce data transmission requirements and in-sensor energy consumption within arrays of wireless sensors. The proposed method simultaneously acquires and compresses noise-corrupted structural response signals in a pre- and post- earthquake stage, with the scope to detect potential structural damage from changes in the vibration characteristics of the structure (i.e. natural frequencies). As opposed to conventional approaches encountered in practice, the acquired number of measurements is considerably reduced, while computationally intensive operations (i.e., signal reconstruction) are by-passed, paving the way for significant savings in computational power, memory, and on board storage space. 
The idea of using randomly sampled compressive sensing (CS)-based techniques for V-SHM was abandoned on the grounds that these techniques are associated with a number of restrictions, i.e. (i) vibration response signals are treated, theoretically, as deterministic which is not in alignment with the stochastic nature of typical structural response signals under operational conditions, (ii) CS assumes structural response signals of a specific structure (sparsity assumptions) which may not hold true within noisy environments encountered in practice, and (iii) CS involves computationally intensive signal processing operations (signal reconstruction associated with constrained optimization problems subject to signal sparsity constraints).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project provide theoretical and computational developments paving the way for transformative technological advancements towards simpler, less obtrusive, cheaper, and energy efficient sub-Nyquist-based wireless sensors. Specialists on hardware design can exploit the developed theoretical contributions to embed the proposed algorithms within prototyped wireless units for cost-effective V-SHM implementations in civil infrastructures, aiming at enhanced structural sustainability and rapid structural integrity assessment in the aftermath of natural disasters. Thus, it is envisioned considerable new R&amp;amp;D and commercialisation opportunities for UK electric equipment and sensor manufacturing SMEs. Further, the findings can be adopted and further developed by researchers across the structural dynamics, signal processing, and structural health monitoring disciplines.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2D960015-97D1-4D29-AF58-F1C7EC8AC4F9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb0ecda70e79.59527842</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A novel computationally efficient algorithm was developed in [1]-[4] for vibration-based structural health monitoring (V-SHM) of civil engineering structures in operational conditions.
