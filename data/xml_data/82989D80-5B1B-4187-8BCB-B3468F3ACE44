The energy consumed due to general illumination accounts for about 29% of the world's total energy consumption, currently using rather inefficient technologies often containing toxic elements. It is therefore necessary to develop ultra energy-efficient solid-state lighting sources to replace these incandescent and fluorescent lights, for which the leading candidates are mainly based on white light emitting diodes (LEDs). Such white LEDs can be fabricated from inorganic or organic semiconductors, with the former leading the way for high brightness and efficiency. These are constructed from III-nitride semiconductors, which have direct bandgaps across their entire composition range, covering the complete visible spectrum and a major part of the ultraviolet. Fast modulation of the white LEDs, at speeds undetectable to the eye, allows them to also be utilised as optical transmitters for wireless data communication. This opens up the exciting possibility of white LEDs serving as lighting sources for simultaneous illumination and wireless communication. This is the emerging technology of visible light communication (VLC) and has a number of major advantages over the present-day radio frequency (RF) communication technology, such as increasing security, eliminating any RF-induced health concern, etc

However, the performance and cost of current white LEDs is not sufficiently impressive to allow replacement of conventional lighting sources at the moment. Furthermore, in terms of VLC applications, the bandwidth is currently limited to the MHz level, which is well below the practical requirements of current broadband WiFi systems. This is due to the long carrier recombination lifetime of current III-nitride based LEDs, which are conventionally grown in a &amp;quot;polar&amp;quot; orientation containing intense piezoelectric fields. These fields result in a reduced overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions in the active regions of the LEDs, which then suffer from long radiative recombination lifetimes (10-100 ns) and also low internal quantum efficiency. In addition, the conventional phosphors used to convert the emission to white light have even longer decay times and presents an additional limitation on the available bandwidth. 

The project will employ non-polar III-nitrides and integrate the two major semiconductor families (organic and inorganic semiconductors) using a novel nanofabrication technology in order to achieve ultra energy efficient LEDs with ultrafast modulation speeds for next generation III-nitride based white lighting. Structuring on a nanometre scale will be used in the growth of the III-nitride layers to achieve high quality non-polar GaN, thereby eliminating the piezoelectric fields to give faster, more efficient devices. The nanostructures will also be used to introduce extra nanocavity effects, further reducing the radiative recombination lifetime and increasing the optical efficiency. The target of the project is a novel hybrid nanostructure to achieve prototype white-LEDs with a modulation speed on a level of 10 GHz and a step change in energy efficiency compared with the current state-of-the-art. The devices will be fabricated using metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy and cleanroom processing and fully characterised using optical and electrical measurements. Each stage in the process will be optimised and close working with industry will ensure that the resulting methods are practical and scalable to high volumes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274705</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset provides the experimental data used to generate the figures in the paper entitled &amp;quot;Cool to Warm White Light Emission from Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Light-Emitting Diodes&amp;quot;.

The data discussed and presented in the paper was recorded using an integrating sphere (Labsphere Illumina 600/610). The resultant electroluminescence spectra are corrected for the system response and the intensity is measured in absolute values (W/nm). The LEDs were powered using a Keithley source measure unit, which provided the applied current and voltage values. Parameters such as colour rendering index, correlated colour temperature , chromaticity cordinates, temperature and various efficacy/efficienct values were calculated from the recorded response-corrected spectra and the electrical input power. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2700 instrument. Photoluminescence measurements were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B fluorescence spectrometer in a quartz cuvette (path length 10 mm).

Abstract of the paper:

The synthesis and characterisation of two novel organic down-converting molecules is disclosed, together with their performance as functional colour-converters in combination with inorganic blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Each molecule contains two fluorene-triphenylamine arms, connected to either a benzothiadiazole or bisbenzothiadiazole core. These molecules have been selected on the basis that they are free from absorption bands in the green region of the visible spectrum to maximise their performance and offer improvements compared with previous BODIPY-containing analogues. The inorganic InGaN/GaN LED emits at 444 nm, overlying the absorption of each of the organic molecules. The combination of the blue (inorganic) and yellow (organic) emission is shown to produce reasonable quality, white light-emitting hybrid devices for both down-converter molecules. Cool to warm white light is achieved for both molecules by increasing the concentration. An optimum colour rendering index (CRI) value of 66 is obtained for the mono-benzothiadiazole molecule. Also a high blue-to-white efficacy (defined as white luminous flux (lm)/blue radiant flux (W)) of 368 lm/W is achieved, superseding the current phosphor converters of 200-300 lm/W. A comparison of these down-converting molecules to the older generation BODIPY-containing molecules is also provided.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BCAC4E3-4415-4362-9ED0-7D187FFB601E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98721cd4ab6.12066496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset for &quot;Cool to Warm White Light Emission from Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Light-Emitting Diodes&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset provides the experimental data used to generate the figures in the paper entitled &amp;quot;Optical Investigation of Semi-polar (11-22) AlGaN with High Al Composition&amp;quot;

The data discussed and presented in the paper was recorded using a variable pressure field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 250) which is equipped with a custom-built cathodoluminescence (CL) hyperspectral imaging system. The CL system collects the emitted light at an angle of 45&amp;deg; with respect to the incident electron beam using a Cassegrain reflecting objective. The light is then dispersed using a 125 mm focal length spectrograph (Oriel MS125) and detected using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Andor Newton). As the electron beam scans across the sample surface, a whole CL spectrum is recorded per pixel building up the a 3D hyperspectral data set. 2D CL images can then be extracted from the hyperspectral data set, such as peak energy, intensity or half width.

Abstract of the paper:

Exciton localization disturbs uniform population inversion, leading to an increase in threshold current for lasing. High Al content AlGaN is required for the fabrication of deep ultra-violet LDs, generating exciton localization. Photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements have been performed on high quality semi-polar (11-22) AlxGa1-xN alloys with high Al composition in order to study the optical properties of both the near-band-edge (NBE) emission and the basal-plane stacking faults (BSFs) related emission, demonstrating different behaviours. Further comparison with the exciton localization of their c-plane counterparts exhibits that the exciton localization in semi-polar (11-22) AlGaN is much smaller than that in c-plane AlGaN.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB948128-4165-488F-98BA-EDD9E27B4703</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98920587462.42230886</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset for &quot;Optical Investigation of Semi-polar (11-22) AlGaN with High Al Composition&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset provides the experimental data used to generate the figures in the paper entitled &amp;quot;Colour tuning in white hybrid inorganic/organic light-emitting diodes&amp;quot; by J.

Abstract of the paper:

White hybrid inorganic/organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were fabricated by combining a novel organic colour converter with a blue inorganic LED. An organic small molecule was specifically synthesised to act as down-converter. The characteristics of the white colour were controlled by changing the concentration of the organic molecule based on the BODIPY unit, which was embedded in a transparent matrix, and volume of the molecule and encapsulant mixture. The concentration has a critical effect on the conversion efficiency, i.e. how much of the absorbed blue light is converted into yellow light. With increasing concentration the conversion efficiency decreases. This quenching effect is due to aggregation of the organic molecule at higher concentrations. Increasing the deposited amount of the converter does not increase the yellow emission despite more blue light being absorbed. Degradation of the organic converter was also observed during a period of 15 months from LED fabrication. Angular-dependent measurements revealed slight deviation from a Lambertian profile for the blue and yellow emission peaks leading to a small change in &amp;quot;whiteness&amp;quot; with emission angle. Warm white and cool white light with correlated colour temperatures of 2770 K and 7680 K, respectively, were achieved using different concentrations of the converter molecule. Although further work is needed to improve the lifetime and poor colour rendering, these hybrid LEDs show promising results as an alternative approach for generating white LEDs compared with phosphor-based white LEDs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA0BDEF7-2D3C-4BDE-B588-81D9E90F1359</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b986493f9303.70157655</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset for &quot;Colour tuning in white hybrid inorganic/organic light-emitting diodes&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B1135D72-E58B-4845-A01D-CE6886D32133</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cool to warm white light emission from hybrid inorganic/organic light-emitting diodes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Materials Chemistry C</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2144a6e150865c687af636acc8a8981a"><gtr:id>2144a6e150865c687af636acc8a8981a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor-Shaw E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589361772e7677.57899654</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2F6AFD4D-ED32-4BFE-9B4A-F472221DF47E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Colour tuning in white hybrid inorganic/organic light-emitting diodes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ab3a6d3a3c58973dc41b561de00fbe50"><gtr:id>ab3a6d3a3c58973dc41b561de00fbe50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bruckbauer J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d342d9151f5.69270071</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE0EFB9E-4C83-4900-9B5A-A18F7F777DE7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optical investigation of semi-polar (11-22) Al
