In the past five years, surprising links between the three areas mentioned in

understanding of these connections has been gained, especially in the particular
case of coordinate algebras of matrices. The present project aims to further
this understanding by deepening the knowledge of the matrix case and by
expanding the scope of the knowledge to include algebras such as
grassmannians, partial flag varieties and De Concini-Kac-Procesi algebras. 

The growth part of the project will concentrate on two specific types of
growth: quadratic growth/Gelfand-Kirillov dimension two, and intermediate
growth (super polynomial, but subexponential).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Totally nonnegativity, quantum algebras

Impact summary: 



The research proposed in this application is of a fundamental nature. 

It is wide ranging in that it involves the three areas of noncommutative
algebra, Poisson algebraic geometry and linear algebra. Also, the solutions
often involve representation theory and combinatorics. 

The development of the theory of quantum algebras was motivated by problems in
Physics from the 1980s onwards. Totally nonnegative matrices have been
involved in problems in such diverse areas as mechanical systems, birth and
death processes, planar resistor networks, computer aided geometric design,
juggling, etc. 


Main Beneficiaries:

The main beneficiaries will be the academic community, especially those
working in the areas mentioned above. Through the allied training and outreach
work associated to this proposal, as outlined below, future generations of
mathematicians will also benefit and this will feed into the general 
scientific base of the whole country. 


Dissemination:

Results obtained will be disseminated in the normal manner for pure
mathematics: posting of papers on personal webpages and the arXiv,
presentation of the results in seminars, colloquia and workshops, and
publication in leading journals. In particular, the visit to MSRI in May 2013
will be used to promulgate existing results to the mathematical community. 

In addition, the accessibility of the totally nonnegative part of the proposal
makes it possible to involve undergraduates and masters students in work at
the forefront of the subject. The PI has already directed undergraduate
students in projects concerning unsolved problems in both total nonnegativity
and growth, giving students at that level an unusual opportunity to study
problems at the boundary of pure mathematical knowledge. At an earlier stage
of this continuing project, Launois and the PI presented a short course in the
London Taught Course Centre on results in the area. 

Finally, Launois and the PI are in the process of writing a book on total 
nonnegativity which will be accessible to senior honours/masters/beginning 
postgraduate students. 

Outreach:

The PI intends to continue with his outreach activities. In the last two years
he has given presentations to school children in France and Skye. 

It is fortunate that, although two of the main areas involved in the project
require substantial background knowledge even to understand the questions, the
third area,that of total nonegativity, involves ideas that are easily stated
and accessible to anyone with a basic scientific training. The PI has recently
given talks on this topic to broad mathematical audiences; for example, an
invited talk at the London Mathematical Society at its Mary Cartwright meeting
in London in February 2012 and a recent meeting in Antwerp in October 2012. 


Outputs:

Publications: It is envisaged that this series of visits will lead 
to at least three publications to appear in respected international 
journals (two in quantum algebras/total nonnegativity, and one on growth). 

Talks: The existing results will be promulgated during the MSRI 
programme in Spring 2013. In addition, at least two invited plenary talks 
will concentrate on the materials of this proposal: one will be at 
the workshop ``Classical aspects of ring theory and module theory'', at 
the Polish Academy of Sciences centre in Bedlewo, Poland, in July 2013. 

Training: At least two projects at masters level concerning the
materials in this proposal will be supervised by the PI in the next two years.
It is hoped that this will lead to enrolments onto PhD programmes by
successful students.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Nil return October 2014</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Nil return October 2014</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>932EA721-9425-4727-911F-CB5029F7C1CB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a30db6710a6.34690336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E2D0D498-DE44-45C3-827E-009091A312D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>AUTOMORPHISMS OF QUANTUM MATRICES</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Glasgow Mathematical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7402ed2ccf2f89f55de88c4c5ec916da"><gtr:id>7402ed2ccf2f89f55de88c4c5ec916da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LAUNOIS S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>560571da176ec1.56551974</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A6D5CFF6-D05F-4F7D-B8AB-573FEFDC638B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Efficient Recognition of Totally Nonnegative Matrix Cells</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Foundations of Computational Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e4d5eaf7dff95212361eaac16664282e"><gtr:id>e4d5eaf7dff95212361eaac16664282e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Launois S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56057012ac8bf8.86551574</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DECB6C20-B01F-4E21-BD8E-BE38E77EF93C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Leavitt path algebras satisfying a polynomial identity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Algebra and Its Applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f7afdd34c1ae857c662de9e5225286d"><gtr:id>7f7afdd34c1ae857c662de9e5225286d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bell J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56056fc4142a20.55559736</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34B88682-671E-498E-AF8B-D1B07DF17610</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prime factors of quantum Schubert cell algebras and clusters for quantum Richardson varieties</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal f?r die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/64c84216dcd0d8fb0854e2c012e1a5d2"><gtr:id>64c84216dcd0d8fb0854e2c012e1a5d2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lenagan T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d4cde4224c2.90907324</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K035827/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
