A subsidy for pig production amounting to 23% of value at farmgate averaged across OECD countries which is not available to UK producers exerts increased competitive pressure. Despite large efficient pig and poultry industries the UK has a negative trade balance in both broiler and pig meat production (DEFRA 2007, 2008). Competitive pressure and technological progress have driven remarkable improvements in production efficiency. For instance in broiler production daily weight gain doubled, from 30 grammes per day (g/d) in 1970 to 60 g/d in 2003 and food conversion efficiency (kilogrammes (kg) feed per kg live weight gain) improved from 2.3 to 1.8 over the same period. Productivity gains have been primarily associated with genetic improvement, better nutrition and dramatic advances in disease control which in turn have permitted greater intensification and thus production efficiency. The rate of improvement has slowed as solutions have been found to many straightforward problems and a requirement now exists for more technologically sophisticated innovation. A further step-change in productivity will be required on a global scale to meet the predicted population growth and increased consumption of animal protein which is set to double by 2030. The improved prosperity and social changes in developing countries threaten UK food security which historically has been assured by importation when internal production is inadequate. It is environmentally undesirable to increase the 'footprint' (fresh water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and soil degradation) as production increases. The livestock industry will be best served by a workforce capable of integrating knowledge and understanding from the DNA of the production animal to the diet of the consumer and in the context of economic reality, business efficiency and ethical constraint. There is a growing shortage of veterinary and associated scientific skills provision for intensive livestock production in the UK. This presents a real, structural danger to UK food security and is contributing to lack of economic competitiveness. Only 3.8% of veterinarians in the UK work in exclusively production animal practice and by inference a smaller proportion work in intensive livestock production (RCVS survey 2010). Whilst veterinarians qualify with an all round ability to deal with the major challenges that arise with food animals, they do not receive the highly specialised training required to operate effectively as intensive livestock veterinarians. Currently veterinarians holding specialist diplomas in poultry and pig medicine in the UK number 6 and 12 respectively (RCVS Register 2009) and of these 72% acquired their diplomas before 1987, suggesting an ageing population. Only 8 UK based European college diplomats exist and there are only 6 European diplomats in the corresponding poultry science college, reflecting the skills shortage in mainland Europe. A similar shortage exists in the USA. Furthermore there are few basic or applied scientists with specialised knowledge of chicken and pig biology and a review of provision for Land Based Studies (HEFCE 2007) identified the paucity of students engaged in courses on livestock production. The case for support is that: Despite an efficient pig and poultry industry the UK has a negative trade balance in pig and poultry products. Substantial improvements in productivity will be required to remain competitive, to contribute to global consumption, to ensure UK food security and to reduce environmental impact. Holistic expertise will be required from DNA to diet to support the industry. There is a small declining cadre of skilled veterinarians and scientists supporting the sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A postgraduate, work place based, flexible delivery programme with the option of residential modules is proposed. Graduates will receive advanced training skills at Certificate, Diploma, Masters and Professional Doctorate level utilising industry informed curricula. The core component of the programme comprises seven courses within which are 30 modules delivering approximately 1800 nominal hours of study essential to the acquisition of a Masters in Intensive Livestock Production or modules towards a Masters in animal sciences. The Masters in Intensive Livestock Production comprises the sciences of Production, Performance, Profitability, Prevention, Probability, Policy and Practice (see Appendix 1). These embrace the spectrum of subjects and disciplines essential to a holistic approach from farm to fork. Appropriate expertise is available from the delivery partners to support the biological sciences and integrate these with economics, business, social and environmental sciences. The educational goal will be to develop the mindset of participants with laboratory, research and innovation skills and an appetite for continual progress. The Animal Science modules (Appendix 2) provide fundamental skills in histology, pathology, physiology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics relevant to animal production. The courses will be available to graduate veterinarians and scientists and can be taken within a single year or over a number of years. An MSc may be obtained by successfully completing seven courses from either the Intensive Livestock Production or Animal Sciences programmes, or completing four courses plus a project (equivalent to 20 weeks or 720 credit hours of study). A Professional Doctorate may also be acquired by the successful completion of seven courses and a research project of appropriate extent and depth. Research projects may be practice or industry based utilising the clinical caseload, production system or business environment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed programme is a 'boutique' product and it is anticipated that the number of participants will be small, nevertheless the cost-benefit will be substantial since each trained individual will be dealing with many thousands (pigs) or millions (poultry) of animals. The highly skilled individuals produced will contribute in three specific ways. Firstly they will improve the economic competitiveness of the intensive livestock industries. The introduction of new methods, products and processes utilising best practice in ethically appropriate ways and with a deep understanding of economics and business efficiency will drive competitive advantage. The major areas of productivity improvement which have contributed to the doubling of efficiency in the last 30 years include genetic selection, nutritional optimisation and endemic disease control. Improved management and husbandry systems have also contributed. Further incremental improvements in these areas will contribute to future efficiency gains, however a slowing of improvement has been noted as conventional techniques exhaust their potential. Step change is nevertheless possible as technologies improve, for instance it is anticipated that full mammalian or avian genomes will be sequenced in less than 15 minutes and cost less than $1000 within 3 years. The required improvement in productivity will not be achieved by genetics alone since many characteristics are polygenic and therefore likely to be influenced by environment and nutrition. Such improvements will only be achieved through systems integration and whole chain analysis and in a political and social environment in which animal welfare is embraced. The proposed programme will produce individuals able to deliver across the intensive livestock agri-food industry. Secondly they will reduce the risks in the sector associated with major exotic disease (e.g. avian and porcine influenza) and incursions and new challenges from novel pathogens (eg prion disease) and toxins (eg dioxins). Prevention of incursions and limiting spread where incursions occur will be fundamental to the vibrancy of domestic production but also has a critical role to play in maintaining export markets. Although the UK is a net importer of both pig and poultry products there are considerable cross border trade movements in both directions. Furthermore the UK has a leading role in the production and export of grandparent and other breeding stock by virtue of its excellence in genetics. Reducing the risk of incursions requires individuals with high level expertise in biosecurity and surveillance and with the clinical, pathological and histopathological skills to make rapid and accurate diagnoses. Moreover it will require integration of industry, agency and policy networks to ensure ultra-rapid response and containment on a national scale. Thirdly the present programme will make a significant positive benefit to public health by reducing zoonotic pathogen burden in the target animal species and refining methods of husbandry, slaughter, processing and packaging which will limit the transfer of such pathogens in the human food chain. Detailed training in disease prevention covering biosecurity, vaccination, chemotherapy and nutrition and management provide the basic components essential to reduction of pathogen burden, and the knowledge and skills associated with whole chain analysis from farm to fork will make the graduates of this programme uniquely valuable in a public health context. The impact of the present proposal will be substantial because: Each trained individual will be dealing with many thousands or millions of animals or part of a food chain of great economic impact. Major improvements in efficiency, productivity, animal welfare and competitive advantage will be achieved. The risk and consequences of major exotic disease will be reduced. Zoonotic infections from pigs and poultry will be reduced and public health improved.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2907159</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I024313/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
