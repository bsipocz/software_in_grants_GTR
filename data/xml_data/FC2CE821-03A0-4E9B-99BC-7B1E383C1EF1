Current treatment is with intensive chemotherapy, which can result in prolonged hospital admissions for many months. At diagnosis, information regarding the genetics of each patient's leukaemia is sought. This information is mainly used to weigh up the risk of a patient's leukaemia relapsing against the risks of a bone marrow transplant. However, further understanding of how these genetic changes disrupt the normal functioning of blood cells can help us develop new more targeted treatments. In turn this may improve outcomes in all patients - particularly for those who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy or who relapse following treatment.
AML develops from a normal blood stem cell that has acquired successive genetic abnormalities eventually leading to the development of leukaemia. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is an approach that allows us to look at the genetics of the leukaemia in minute detail. NGS has identified more than 250 genetic abnormalities in AML that are observed in more than one individual. To develop leukaemia, each patient seems to need between 5-20 of these mutations. The genes involved vary in their frequency, with only 5 genes found to be mutated in &amp;gt;10% of sporadic AML cases (Kihara et al 2014). One of these genes is called CEBPA. Although most commonly the changes in CEBPA occur after birth to an individual blood stem cell, in a small number of individuals CEBPA mutations can be inherited. This means the genetic error in CEBPA is in all cells and leads to a predisposition to the development of leukaemia. Patients who develop AML that have inherited CEBPA mutations are unique because we can be certain what was the first genetic event in the development of leukaemia. This is important because the first genetic event may be the trigger of all the subsequent changes.
Studies have shown that a gene commonly mutated along with CEBPA is the TET2 gene. In this project we will be investigating the effects of the combination of CEBPA and TET2 mutations on normal blood development and the development of leukaemia. 
The zebrafish is a highly versatile fresh water fish. It is extremely useful for rapid assessment of the effect of multiple genetic abnormalities. This is because it is small, totally transparent and produces many hundreds of offspring each week. Blood develops within the first 5 days of life making it very quick and easy to perform our experiments. Our laboratory has used the zebrafish to investigate how specific genetic mutations lead to clinical syndromes of bone marrow failure and acute leukaemia. We will use the zebrafish to define the combined effects of tet2 and cebpa.
In a third of CEBPA mutated AML patients the additional mutations that lead to the development of leukaemia are unknown. Our project will also investigate which other genes might be important in the development of CEBPA mutated AML. We will do this by a systematic review of already published data on DNA sequencing in sporadic AML and work performed by our collaborators at Barts Cancer Institute on 8 patients with familial CEBPA mutated AML. However, only 17 cases of CEBPA have been fully DNA sequenced to date. We have a large cohort of over 100 patient samples, on which we will collect further information on the mutational landscape of AML by NGS. This will be performed in parallel with our studies on the cebpa/tet2 mutated zebrafish. The intention of these sequencing studies will be both to comprehensively identify which genes are recurrently mutated in CEBPA mutated AML and correlate this to clinical outcomes of patients, and to use this information to move forward to functional assessment in our zebrafish cebpa model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The development of leukaemia occurs as a result of the step-wise acquisition of mutations within a haematopoietic stem or progenitor cell (HSPC). It is now recognised that between 5 and 20 mutations occur per AML before the development of frank leukaemia. The CEBPA gene is mutated in 10% of AML and defines a distinct subset of patients. Intriguingly, in a few reported kindreds, mutation in CEBPA occur in the germline, providing clear evidence that CEBPA is the initiating event. The additional mutations that lead to the development of AML remain unclear. Mutations in the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 have recently been reported to occur in concert with CEBPA mutation. We hypothesize that combined mutation of CEBPA and TET2 results in epistatic effects on HSPC, which drive clonal evolution to AML. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will utilize zebrafish models to define the effects of combined mutation of cebpa and tet2 on haematopoiesis and leukaemogenesis in vivo. This model is ideally suited to high throughput assessment of the effects of genetic combinations given its size, fecundity and optical clarity. 
Other important secondary driver events in CEBPA mutated AML are still to be defined. In Aim 2. of this proposal we will capitalise on next generation sequencing data from cases of familial CEBPA mutated AML along with available published whole exome sequencing in CEBPA mutated AML in order to define a series of candidate secondary driver mutations. These candidates will be then be sequenced in a large cohort of 120 patient samples with CEBPA mutations. Mutational profiles will be correlated with clinical outcome data to define clinically relevant recurrent genetic combinations. Mutations identified in this aim will then be poised for functional assessment in our zebrafish model.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the research to be performed can be divided up into anticipated impact different broad non-academic groups.

The results of this study may potentially have a direct impact on patient care. We anticipate that the result of the studies in Aim 2. may identify novel genetic combinations with defined clinical outcomes and this may facilitate our ability to rationalize patient care for some individuals (e.g. for those with very high likelihood of cure- de-escalating therapy, or for those with higher refractory/relapse risk prioritize to allogeneic stem cell transplant) 

Other beneficiaries will include charitable organizations (CRUK, LLR, Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund) who may utilize our novel model system to demonstrate the power of experimental strategies (as heavily used by BHF) and also utilize our results to disseminate information to the wider patient and research communities. 

There are also potential impacts long-term on public health and health economics. The treatment of AML is of high intensity, frequently resulting in prolonged patient hospital admissions and intensive care. This research will enhance the capacity to rationalize therapies to those that will benefit most from them and potentially allow de-escalation of therapies and their incumbent toxicities and cost for others.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264593</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We used Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) target- ing the N-terminal region of zebrafish cebpa as well as Clustered, Regu- larly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) single guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting the same location. Cebpa TALENs TAL3040 and TAL3041 were a gift from Keith Joung (Addgene plasmid # 41214 and 41215).
TALENs or CRISPRs were injected into WT zebrafish embryos at the single-cell stage. Miseq analysis showed that F0 embryos carried 30% muta- tions in the region of the TALEN cleavage site, however no mutations were observed in CRIPSR injected embryos. F1 fish carrying frame shift mut tions were identified tail clip and multiplex miseq of 3 day old F1 progeny. F1 fish carry a 5bp deletion in the N terminal region of cebpa.
To determine the effect of loss of cebpa Nterm isoform we incrossed cebpaNterm/+ adults and stained then for mature myeloid cells using the histochemical stain sudan black. Consistent with the defined role of cebpa in myeloid differnetiation in mammals, at 5 days post fertilisation (dpf) there was complete absence of mature myeloid cells in the caudal haematopoietic tissue.
To permit identification of cebpaNterm/Nterm animals in vivo which were oth- erwise indistinguishable from their siblings we crossed cebpaNterm/+ to transgenics carrying Tg (LyzC:mCherry). This transgenic expresses mCherry in mature granulocytes and some monocytic cells. By 3dpf the majority of cebpaNterm/Nterm could be identified by absence of mCherry positive cells in the CHT.
To determine if cebpaNterm/Ntermanimals death related to haematopoietic disease we utilized another transgenic animal Tg(CD41:eGFP) crossed to the existing cebpaNterm/+;Tg(lysC:mCherry). These double transgenic mutants have red fluorescent mature myeloid cells, bright green thrombocytes and dim green HSPCs. Assessment by flow cytometry of marrow at 4 weeks of age confirmed ongoing absence of mature myeloid cells, but increased numbers of progenitor cells. However, homozygous fish surviving to 6 weeks showed comparable numbers of mature myeloid cells compared to wild type and heterozygous siblings.
We initally observed no surviving cebpaNterm/Nterm animals at genotyping at 3 months of age. This prompted us to investigate at what point in development cebpaNterm/Nterm died and the cause of death. We observed cebpaNterm/Nterm to be smaller than their siblings and all died by 35dpf. In addition there was a dose dependent difference in body weights be- tween cebpaNterm/Nterm cebpaNterm/+ and cebpa+/+
cebpaNterm/Nterm mutants surviving to 4 or more weeks were examined under microscopy. Prior to clinical deterioration small cebpaNterm/Nterm mutants show an increase in CD41:GFP expression. Peripheral blood examination of these animals showed cells exhibiting morphological features suggestive of primitive myeloid origin. Further investigation of animals with the observed increase in CD41:GFP expression was carried out with immunohistochemical staining of whole animal sagittal sections. MGG staining of the juvenile kidney (bone marrow equivalent) showed clusters of large primitive cells with a reduction in mature myeloid cells and disruption of erythroid island architecture. These cells were negative for mpx expression (normal mpx expressing myeloid cell marked). Flow cytometry on whole kidney marrow of cebpaNterm/Nterm expressing widespread GFP fluorescence under epifluorescent microscopy compared to cebpaNterm/+ siblings showed a marked increase in CD41:GFP expressing cells within the progenitor gate. These cells were negative for the mature myeloid marker LysC. The cebpaNterm/Nterm was also markedly anaemic, in keeping with observed behavioural changes and exhibited sensitivity to tricaine induced gill bleeding.</gtr:description><gtr:id>538DCDB0-9314-41E6-AAFE-88020CF06734</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Model of:
