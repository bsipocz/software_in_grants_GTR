A vaccine is a preparation that causes an individual to develop effective biological defence mechanisms (immunity) against a pathogen. Most often, vaccination is used to protect against an infectious disease, though cancers are also increasingly being targeted. Typically a vaccine will contain a small amount of a material which resembles a disease-causing agent (the 'antigen' - a viral, microbial or tumour component), but does not carry an infectious risk. The vaccine causes the immune system to recognize the antigen as foreign, eliminate it, and &amp;quot;remember&amp;quot; it, thereby conferring effective immunity against the pathogen. In order to ensure that robust immunity is inculcated, an &amp;quot;adjuvant&amp;quot; is usually added to vaccines to mimic the danger signals that naturally trigger immune responses. At present, inorganic compounds known as 'alums' (usually either AlOOH or amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate) are used as adjuvants in the majority of cases. 'Alum' can lead to strong immunity to microbes and larger parasites, but does not provoke the necessary immune response to overcome viral infections or the majority of cancers. There is at present a lack of alternative adjuvants able to drive such responses; in this work, we seek to redress this deficiency.

Recent work has established that a family of inorganic materials known as layered double hydroxides can act as potent adjuvants whose immunogenicity can be systematically varied through control of their physicochemical properties. In this work, we will explore the metal organic framework (MOF) family of materials. MOFs are a class of materials containing metal centres connected in three dimensions by organic linkers. They have enormous structural diversity, and commonly contain empty 'pores' into which antigens may be incorporated. MOFs have successfully been used for drug delivery and other biomedical applications. They have however never been explored for use as adjuvants. We will systematically synthesise three sets of MOFs (known materials, known materials with immunogenic moieties embedded, and MOFs where the organic linker is immunogenic) and investigate the immune response to these in vitro. This work will be complemented with a detailed systems-level study looking to draw correlations between the materials' physicochemical properties and the immune responses they invoke.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- Who will benefit from this research? 
This project has the potential to provide extensive benefits to research scientists and medical practitioners, members of the general public who are directly or indirectly affected by diseases or conditions where effective vaccines are not available (e.g. malaria, HIV), and companies working on vaccine and adjuvant development (principally the pharmaceutical industry).

- How will they benefit? 
These groups will benefit when the outcomes of this project are promulgated into the public domain through conference presentations and journal articles. Beyond this, the project will directly transfer technical and managerial skills to the post-doctoral research assistant (PDRA) employed on the contract, and indirectly to PhD, MPharm and MSc students working in the research group. This will help us to build up an international skills base as these students and the PDRA move on to positions in other academic institutions, in industry or in government. 

- What will be done to ensure the beneficiaries have the opportunity to benefit from this research? 
The work proposed in this project will identify metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with the potential to increase vaccine efficacy, and hence should ultimately lead to advances in human health and well-being. As a result of the elucidation of relationships between the physicochemical properties of the MOF materials and the immune response stimulated, researchers in materials science, biomaterials and vaccinology will benefit from our findings. In the short term (1 - 3 years), they will receive this benefit via our presentation of the results at large international conferences and in articles in peer-reviewed and internationally recognised journals. The past impact of GRW's work is evidenced by an h-index of 14 and a total number of citations of 710 (Aug 2013). In the medium- to long-term (5 - 10 years) possible benefits include new adjuvants being taken forward into trials, and the streamlining of the adjuvant discovery process as a result of new structure-property relationships permitting systematic adjuvant design and reduced use of animals in the vaccine development pathway. This in turn should result in considerable cost savings for the pharmaceutical industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98894</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Chemistry St Andrews</gtr:department><gtr:description>New collaboration with Prof Russell Morris, University of St Andrews</gtr:description><gtr:id>62244EAD-188A-4B49-84D8-6677D86A023F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far, one publication, with a PhD thesis being written up.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5649cfdfc82b08.16700568-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Ms Kasia Mocniak, a PhD student from Prof Morris' group has spent 18 months as a visiting student in UCL.

A range of Al-containing MOFs was first prepared and the immune response stimulated in vitro found to be clearly dependent on the organic linker which connects the Al ions in the framework. The MOFs performed better than commercial &amp;quot;alum&amp;quot; adjuvants in many cases. The effect of the metal ion was next probed using a family of MOFs where different metal centres were connected by the same linker molecule. This showed that the metal centre is also important in controlling the immune response stimulated, with the MOFs again often performing better than commercial adjuvants. 

MOFs contain large empty pores which can be filled with other species. We thus next intercalated a range of immunogenic molecules into selected MOFs, and found that the incorporation of the immunopotentiator succinic acid in particular could increase the immune response seen. Finally, MOFs were prepared in which the linkers themselves were immunogenic, and succinic acid again found to be particularly potent.

A systems level statistical analysis has been undertaken to explore the relationship between the MOF physicochemical properties and the immune response. Statistically significant differences have been observed in many cases as a result of linker/metal ions being changed, showing that the properties of the MOFs have a profound influence on the immune response.

This work has thus comprehensively developed that MOFs are potent and tuneable adjuvants. This opens up the question of whether they can be loaded with antigens (subunits of a pathogen) in order to prepare vaccines which are both tuneable and able to stabilise the antigen to heat and light. If so, a paradigm shift in vaccination may be possible - at present, many vaccines are exposed to elevated temperatures during transport, as a result of which the formulation degrades.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have already been shared with the community through conference presentations and invited seminars. Papers reporting these results are under preparation and will be submitted to prestigious journals in the coming months. The results we have obtained can be taken forward by academic investigators working on adjuvants and vaccines, since we have identified potent new adjuvant materials. Non-academic users working on adjuvants will also be able to build on our findings in similar manners. The latter are likely to be in the healthcare or biotechnology sectors, and in addition to publication/presentation efforts are underway to engage these potential end users in accordance with the original workplan. Personal contacts, the fora offered by the UCL-Nottingham CDT Centre for Doctoral Training in Advanced Therapeutics and Nanomedicines, and RSC/APS focus groups are being exploited to make putative end users aware of the work. The findings of this work could ultimately be used to make vaccine formulations stable to elevated temperatures and light, potentially solving a major problem in the provision of vaccines to the developing world.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7C73D064-2E07-4EDD-917C-05FD1ED12790</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b23a990704c1.80011044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A20606D-EDC8-4E3D-979B-461DCC5F2C28</gtr:id><gtr:title>Incorporation of cisplatin into the metal&amp;acirc;??organic frameworks UiO66-NH
