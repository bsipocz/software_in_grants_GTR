The success of the current GridPP Collaboration will be built upon, and the UK's response to production of LHC data in the period April 2011 to March 2015 will be to ensure that there is a sustainable infrastructure providing &amp;quot;Computing in the LHC era&amp;quot;
We propose to operate a Grid as the main mechanism for delivering very large-scale computational resources to the UK particle physics community. This foundation will underpin the success and increase the discovery potential of UK physicists. We will operate a production-quality Grid, delivering robustness, scale and functionality. The proposal is fully integrated with international projects and we must exploit the opportunity to capitalise on the UK leadership already established in several areas. The Particle Physics Grid will form a central part of the UK National Grid Infrastructure (NGI) that will be integrated with the European Grid Initiative (EGI) and which will inter-operate with Grids in the United States and elsewhere. The project will be managed across various domains and will deliver the UK's commitment to the worldwide LHC Computing Grid (wLCG) and ensure that worldwide activities directly benefit the UK.
By 2015, the UK Grid infrastructure will have expanded in size to 40,000 cores, with more than 60 PetaBytes of storage. This will enable the UK to exploit, in an internationally competitive way, the unique physics potential of the LHC.
A total request is made for &amp;pound;27.8m for a four year GridPP4 project starting in April 2011.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>GridPP's knowledge exchange activities fall into two main areas: firstly, those aimed at other academic disciplines, and secondly, business and industry. GridPP has a strong outreach programme to a public and academic audience, and intends to continue this in GridPP4. The Dissemination Officer will organise GridPP's presence at conferences and events. This includes booking and manning booths, arranging backdrops, material, posters, screens, and rotas where appropriate. Examples of events that we have attended include The British Science Festival, The Royal Society Summer Exhibition, the British Science Association Science Communication Conference and Meet The Scientist at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.
In the last 8 years GridPP has developed an extensive website that is central to project communications and won 'Best e-Science project website' at the 2004 All Hands Meeting. The Dissemination Officer will be responsible for producing news items for the website and drafting GridPP press releases. We have had broad coverage from these in the past, including many national newspapers and online publications.
Additional activities will include producing GridPP material, such as leaflets, posters, t-shirts, bags and magic cubes. We have found these very valuable in raising GridPP's and LHC's profile at minimal cost. The Dissemination Officer will also promote outreach training for members of the collaboration, will identify GridPP staff who have specific expertise in this area and will arrange occasional GridPP events, such as the QMUL opening and the Tier-1 open day.
On KE, our initial work has proved that GridPP's technology can be of use across a range of disciplines and sectors, and we plan to continue this work during GridPP4. The objectives of this program will be to improve awareness of the technologies developed by GridPP and its partners in academia and industry, and hence facilitate the increase in use of these technologies within new areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at workshop on &quot;Big Data&quot; (Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>904FCDD6-A75B-4E18-957E-E737EE31F9A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Mark Slater presented and participated at a &amp;quot;Big Data&amp;quot; workshop that brought together professional academic and research staff from many disciplines from across the University of Birmingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d08911c5ca13.62314566</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Computing conference talk (Berlin, Germany)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9739D83F-5DA1-4A24-AEE9-CA8521851448</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference talk about computing Grid application software &amp;quot;Ganga: an interface to the LHC computing grid&amp;quot;, presented by Dr Matthew Williams, to a general audience of IT professionals, which stimulated increased interest in this area of research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d0847bbfbf60.71556268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ep2014.europython.eu/en/schedule/sessions/54/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>General support for non-LHC users of Grid computing</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58C38248-8A21-4E71-834B-5508C8547072</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Mark Slater provided general support for several small users and collaborations to allow them to leverage the grid resources, these include: PravDa (Beam therapy), LSST (Astrophysics), SNO+ and T2K (both non-LHC Particle Physics).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d08787199116.90109350</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Python training day for Computational Biology department (Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F45A093F-42CB-49D3-9E6D-D78E659A5EFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provided a day's training on Python for Computational Biology department in Birmingham.
