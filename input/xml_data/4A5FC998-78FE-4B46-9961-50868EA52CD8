Each year, member countries field an agreed module of 60 questions on a particular topic, usually as part of an existing random probability survey. The data from these studies, along with a set of prescribed socio-demographic background variables is then deposited in an agreed format with ISSP data archive. 

A wide range of different modules have been fielded since the project began in 1985, covering topics such as social inequality, religion and the role of government. Topics are chosen at an annual plenary meeting by attending members. They are revisited periodically, with a number having been covered three or four times. As a result, ISSP data can be used both to examine differences between countries at a particular point in time and to compare differences in trends over time.

A combined dataset containing data for all countries is made publicly available to the research community approximately two years after data collection has taken place. ISSP data are widely used; worldwide, over 200 publications are recorded each year. In Britain, there have been over 500 publications using ISSP data since the programme began, close to 10% of the worldwide total.

Since ISSP began, Britain's participation has been facilitated by including the ISSP module on a self-completion supplement that forms part of the British Social Attitudes survey (BSA), an annual, high quality independent survey conducted by NatCen. This is a highly cost effective way of fielding the module, as only the marginal costs of asking the ISSP questions have to be covered.

Until 2002, British participation was primarily funded through core funding given to the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends, an ESRC Research Centre. Since 2004 it has been funded as a research resource by the ESRC Resources Board, and this application proposes that this arrangement should continue for a further three years. 

ISSP will cover three topics during this period: role of government (2016), social networks (2017) and religion (2018):
- The role of government module was previously fielded in 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2006. Its repetition will provide valuable data allowing us to track how views about issues such as extremism, surveillance and counter-terrorism have changed over time, at a time when many countries have experienced terror attacks or threats (and thus when we might anticipate attitude change)
- The 2017 module on social networks was fielded in 1986 and 2004, and will include questions on support networks, a census of family and friendship relations, the use of social media in maintaining relationships, and whether relationships are positive or not. The module also looks at who should provide care and services for vulnerable groups at a time when an aging population is causing financial strain in many countries
- The 2018 module on religion (asked 1991, 1998, 2008) will allow us to examine spirituality and well-being, the place of religion within state institutions, and the role of religion in conflict and extremism. This will provide valuable insights into how people follow and perceive religion during a period when it has been called on to justify acts of extremism and aggression

A range of dissemination activities promoting awareness and use of ISSP data by social science researchers, policy-makers and media are proposed. These include: including at least one chapter a year based on ISSP data in the annual BSA report, which is freely available online and widely disseminated; developing a bespoke ISSP website including visualization of ISSP data; utilizing NatCen's strong social media presence to raise awareness of the data; delivering presentations to relevant research and policy audiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be social scientists, both in Britain and internationally, with an interest in conducting cross-national research. The data collected as part of ISSP will provide them with a unique resource (see section on Academic Beneficiaries and Case for Support for further details). 

Academics will readily be able to access the British data through the UK Data Archive whilst the full cross-national data set will be made available one year later via the ISSP website and the ZentralArchiv fur Emprische Sozialforschung (ZA), University of Cologne. As in previous years, full documentation will be provided along with the data.

The importance of the data set to academic users is reflected in the large number of publications using ISSP data. In Britain alone, over 500 publications using ISSP data have been recorded (Britain is the 3rd highest contributing country after the USA and Germany). Use of the British data is of course far greater than this figure suggests, as they are used in a wide range of publications generated outside the UK (the worldwide total for known publications using ISSP data stands at 7,713). Further information about ISSP publication trends can be found at www.issp.org/page.php?pageId=150. 

We are committed to a wide range of dissemination activities to ensure that the ISSP data collected are widely known about, used and cited within the academic community. These include:
- Developing a bespoke website for Britain's involvement in ISSP, linking to the relevant ISSP and BSA data-sets and serving as a platform for providing information on and generating interest in the survey. 
- Giving presentations on ISSP to appropriate audiences (in recent years, these have included a UNESCO roundtable event, and a special lecture organised by NatCen, City University and ESDS, which focused on ISSP and the European Social Survey) 
- Ensuring information about data releases appears on relevant academic list-servers
- Publicising findings by including chapters based on ISSP data in the annual BSA reports. For example,
- the 33rd Report (2016) will include a chapter on work orientation using questions asked on this topic on the 2012 survey. The chapter will explore the polarisation of attitudes towards and evaluations of work across a period of recession and instability, and will make use of time series data on this topic, which was also asked in 2005, 1997 and 1989;
- The latest report (British Social Attitudes: the 32nd report), published in 2015, drew on ISSP questions asked on citizenship in 2014. Phillips and Simpson used this data alongside questions asked elsewhere on the British Social Attitudes survey to explore current trends around interest in politics. 
- The previous report (Kiss and Park in the 31st report) drew extensively on the ISSP 2013 National identity module. Here the authors explored civic and ethnic definitions of national identity. They were able to make comparisons with 1995 and 2003 when British Social Attitudes last featured the ISSP National identity module. 
- The 30th Report (2013) included a chapter on gender roles and family using questions asked in the 2012 survey (and previously 2002, 1994 and 1988). This chapter drew much media attention;

Whilst the main purpose of this application is for funds to provide a resource for the academic community, it is anticipated that the published findings that result from it will be of considerable interest to wider communities including government policy makers, practitioners and the media. Several elements of our proposed dissemination strategy will help ISSP findings to reach and inform a wider audience, in addition our commitment to ensuring that the annual British Social Attitudes report, which receives extensive media coverage, contains a chapter using ISSP data each year.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153033</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002234/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B429D0DD-8AFA-4BA0-86CB-0857E81FC4B6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
