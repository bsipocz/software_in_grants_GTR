During the seventeenth century, news-gathering, reading and gossiping were closely interrelated activities. Pepys was an expert sifter of news, a devoted bibliophile, and inveterate gossip, and as such his papers provide an extraordinarily rich resource for study of reading practices and the transmission of texts in the decades following the Restoration. To better understand the history of reading, publishing and book collecting in the period 1660-1700, we need to take advantage of the kind of detailed, contextual information that Pepys provides. Studying Pepys's reading behaviour encourages, indeed necessitates, an interdisciplinary approach, for Pepys did not confine himself to the novels and plays that are of interest to literary critics or to the newsbooks and satire primarily of interest to political historian: he read widely in variety of works, including scientific treatises, descriptions of the latest technologies, sermons, conduct books and ballads. \n\nMy research project goes beyond Pepys's famous diary to consider the evidence of his library which survives at Magdalene College, Cambridge, his copious correspondence, and his unpublished and little known papers (from shopping lists to account books) now in the Bodleian Library. Other evidence comes from the papers of Pepys's many associates and from the documents of contemporaries such as the clergyman Giles More. Using these records, I examine how works from a range of major genres were used by Pepys and his contemporaries in the period 1660-1700: What factors commonly prompted the reading and acquisition of works? What were the priorities in interpreting particular types of text? What functions did the ownership and display of books serve for Pepys, his friends and colleagues? \n\nSamuel Pepys was in some ways an extraordinary reader, but his curiosity and his concern for documenting information mean that his papers tell us much about reading and news-gathering in a cross-section of Restoration society: the reading activity of nobles, merchants, gentlewomen and servants left their traces in the records created by or associated with Pepys. Indeed, as Pepys's career and his bibliophilia progressed, he built up international networks of contacts who exchanged news, gossip, books and ideas around Europe. Crucially, the papers of Pepys and his contacts offer details which allow us not only to track how social relationships influenced reading habits, but also to trace the relationships between oral, scribal and printed media. Samuel Pepys thus stands at the centre of this study, which aims to increase our understanding of the receipt and exchange of information at a time of momentous events in politics and also in the booktrade. For those with interests in the history of the book, Restoration political history, early modern intellectual history and the development of genres this will prove an intriguing and accessible work.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the project:\n-Academic researchers, primarily those in working on the history of the book, seventeenth century history, and early modern literature.\n-English and History undergraduates taking courses such as 'Restoration Literature' and 'Tudors and Stuarts'\n-The third sector: arts programmers and journalists; curators and librarians such as those at The Pepys Library, Cambridge, or The Victoria and Albert Museum.\n-The wider public\n\nWhen it comes to reaching an audience outside the academic research community, there are serious advantages for a project based around Samuel Pepys. This is a figure who is already well-known to public and indeed has been essential to shaping popular ideas of the Restoration period. \n\nBeyond the academic research community, an important group of beneficiaries will be undergraduate students on English and History courses. While the impacts here may in some cases be indirect (the result of tutors reading my research), I intend my monograph to be accessible to second and third year undergraduates working on the Restoration period. Because I am already catering to an interdisciplinary audience of researchers, many of the glosses and explanations that an undergraduate audience requires will be included. To many undergraduates, Pepys is known by reputation (a scandalous reputation at that) and is therefore a familiar, intriguing figure who can be used to make ostensibly intimidating or 'dry' areas of literature and history interesting. For example, this book will help literature undergraduates understand how different Restoration reading experiences of texts they have studied might be from their own experiences; it will help history students engage with historiography by discussing how histories were being literally rewritten after Restoration of Charles II. Given that Pepys is taught on undergraduate syllabi in many countries, the potential impacts are worldwide.\n\nThere is considerable interest in Pepys amongst the general public, as evinced by Claire Tomalin's best-selling biography (2003) and the publication of Pepys's diary as a daily blog. I believe there is an audience for the monograph itself outside the academic community if it can be re-issued at an appropriate price (around &amp;pound;20) and this something that I will discuss with my publisher. Moreover, I have already had some success in disseminating research from this project to the public. Leicester University issued a press release for my article 'Samuel Pepys and Deb Willett after the Diary' and it received global coverage including in The Times, The Washington Post and The Sydney Morning Herald. This research will also appear as an appendix to the next edition of Tomalin's biography, ensuring it continues to find an audience. To accompany the publication of my book I will seek to publicize some of the findings in popular history magazines or newspaper articles. Having given a paper at the V &amp;amp; A museum in 2008, I will also ensure that representatives from the archives and museums I use in my research are sent copies of my work. I will circulate the information to institutions which have collections on Pepys (such as the Pepys library and the National Maritime Museum) because together we may be able to find other avenues, such as talks, to increase public interest in Pepys and their collections.\n\nThere are therefore manifest economic benefits in this research for the media and the third sector (it can be used to sell newspapers, scholarly biographies and draw people to museums, galleries and churches with collections on and connections to Pepys). These translate into cultural benefits for members of the public with interests in history and literature, for when properly communicated this research invites people to reflect on connections between the cultural history of the Restoration and their own experiences, perhaps</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33799</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research from my wider project on Pepys (including an article which which predates the grant) has been consulted by the organisers of a major exhibition at the National Maritime Museum entitled 'Samuel Pepys: Plague, Fire, and Revolution' (November 2015-March 2016).

My research uses his surviving papers to examine reading practices, collecting, and the exchange of information in the late seventeenth century. Offering the first extensive history of reading during the Restoration, my work traces developments in the book trade and news transmission at a time when England was the scene of dramatic political and religious upheavals. The investigation goes beyond Pepys's famous diary of the 1660s, employing a variety of sources to explore the role that reading played in Pepys's life and in the lives of his contemporaries. 
In the course of my research I have discovered new biographical evidence on Pepys which improves our understanding of his life and his culture. For example, I have uncovered evidence of his changing religious views, tracked his active role in the religious disputes under James II and, in doing so, have shown how sceptical and anti-clerical views were fostered and disseminated during the later seventeenth century. Other discoveries include revealing the mechanisms by which information and gossip were passed between communities in Restoration London; showing how aspects of London's environment encouraged rises in literacy; and demonstrating how the readers and writers of histories coped with the challenges of understanding the recent past in the wake of civil war.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The monograph which was partly funded by this grant, 'Samuel Pepys and his Books: Reading, Newsgathering, and Sociability, 1660-1703', was published by Oxford University Press in summer 2015. This work is of direct interest to researchers working in fields such as the history of the book, seventeenth-century religion and politics, and the history of science. It is also designed to be accessible to undergraduates on seventeenth-century history and literature courses, so I believe it will be used in teaching of those degrees. In providing new insights into a popular historical figure, the book should also attract members of the general public with an interest in Pepys and in better understanding his world.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6B2FC226-623C-4121-86CC-E149C4ECB991</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54491b18ca8268.50655878</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B4B20E90-D216-48D9-8FEC-472E41397268</gtr:id><gtr:title>Further Information on Deb Willet before and after Samuel Pepys's Diary</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Notes and Queries</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/77472d0f9d18e6a63c785fc8210af971"><gtr:id>77472d0f9d18e6a63c785fc8210af971</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loveman K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d047047942ff65</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4FF9CE57-9809-4624-8EE7-B56C77407FF8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Samuel Pepys and 'Discourses touching Religion' under James II</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The English Historical Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/77472d0f9d18e6a63c785fc8210af971"><gtr:id>77472d0f9d18e6a63c785fc8210af971</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loveman K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d04604653cc095</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F62C5E7F-FC93-4376-B6A3-233225FC8A1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Samuel Pepys and his Books: Reading, Newsgathering, and Sociability, 1660-1703</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a9473ef9e3e91f6fe4dbc573920d515"><gtr:id>2a9473ef9e3e91f6fe4dbc573920d515</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loveman</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780198732686</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56b50fd93bae36.98358322</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H03580X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
