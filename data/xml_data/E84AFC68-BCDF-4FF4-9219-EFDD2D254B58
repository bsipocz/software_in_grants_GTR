It explores: how current government strategies and policies relating to citizenship recognise and respond to Muslim religious difference; how participatory forms of governance engage with Muslim groups, religious values and identities; and the impact of Muslims' participation in governance on policy processes and outcomes and for the organisation of and relations between Muslim civil society organisations more broadly.\nThe research explores these issues through analysis of national and local government policies and statements relating to citizenship, equalities, integration and diversity, considering how these refer to and recognise Muslim religious difference. This is extended by qualitative research with state and Muslim actors involved in participatory governance exploring how their understandings of religious identities, values and practices shape their engagement and the impact of this on policy processes and outcomes. \nThe research analyses and compares these processes at national and local levels investigating how different contexts may produce different governance practices and understandings of the role of Muslims in public life, and variations in local responses to national level policies and statements. The research explores how and why some Muslim groups and actors enter into governance at these levels, and the impact this has on relations between Muslim civil society organisations. These questions are investigated through empirical work at national level and in three localities: Birmingham, Leicester and Tower Hamlets. These areas are selected as they have significant, different and diverse Muslim populations, varying ethnic and religious demographic profiles and where the politics of governing religion and diversity are quite different.\nThe research team brings together wide-ranging expertise in the fields of governance, participation, Islam, multicultural citizenship, public policy and local politics and includes: Dr O'Toole (PI, University of Bristol), who has considerable research experience in the fields of political participation, governance, local and community politics and qualitative research; Professor Modood (CI, University of Bristol) who is a leading authority on multiculturalism, British Muslims and citizenship and has a track record of public engagement on these issues; Dr Meer (research consultant, University of Southampton) who has carried out extensive research on Muslim, multicultural and race equality politics; and an External Advisory Group of local and national publicly engaged experts. The team will also employ one Research Officer for 30 months to assist in research design and implementation and one Research Associate for 12 months to assist with local case-study fieldwork.\nThe research will inform current debates on multiculturalism, cohesion, citizenship, the role of religion - and particularly Islam - in public life, and the interplay between secular and religious values in participatory governance. It will be of value to academic, policy-maker and civil society audiences. The research will engage over the life of the project with these audiences by: working with an External Advisory Group; publishing outputs for academic audiences; hosting a national conference and three workshops in the three localities to engage academic, policy-maker, practitioner and civil society actors. The team will also produce a research report and policy briefings to maximise the impact of the research findings.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will engage with and benefit: \n- policy-makers at national and local levels including representatives and officials from the DCLG and Home Office, Birmingham City Council, Leicester City Council and Tower Hamlets Borough Council.

Since it was launched in 2007, the aims and rationale of the government's counter-extremism Prevent agenda have been widely criticised, and its implementation frequently hampered by negative and hostile perceptions. It is important to consider nonetheless the local contexts in which Prevent has been implemented, and how local actors responded to and conducted community engagement under the rubric of Prevent. These were frequently shaped by existing local models and practices of engagement with local communities.
These were some of the key findings of a study of Muslim Participation in Contemporary Governance, that was carried out in 2010-2012, based on documentary analysis, participant-observation and qualitative interviews with 112 Muslim civil society actors, community activists, faith representatives, councillors, politicians, civil servants and policy advisors, at national level and in three local case study areas of Leicester, Tower Hamlets and Birmingham.

Key findings

Leicester: a faith-based paradigm

In Leicester, faith is a distinctive feature of the city's celebratory discourses on diversity and multiculturalism, with faith actors and inter-faith structures occupying a prominent place in local governance networks and forums, such that - in the words of one local actor - in Leicester 'faith is everywhere'. Whilst there was local opposition to the implementation of Prevent in Leicester at the outset, it nonetheless developed in a collaborative manner, with Muslim representatives and interfaith bodies playing a significant role in (re)shaping Prevent to address local objectives. 

When Prevent was introduced in 2007, Leicester City Council was initially reluctant to implement it, fearing it would damage its (carefully built) engagement with local Muslim populations and alienate its substantial Hindu and Sikh populations. As in Bristol, Prevent in Leicester was rebranded - as 'Mainstreaming Moderation', in an effort to avoid what was locally perceived as the negative connotations of 'Prevent'. From the outset, it was focused on addressing all forms of violent extremism - before this became central government policy. Consequently, one local Muslim activist in Leicester, and a member of the Mainstreaming Moderation forum, commented: 'Leicester tended to take a whole different approach to the whole thing. [] the money came in under the Prevent agenda - that was well known - but Leicester tended to unpack that [] so you didn't feel like [] you were under the whole national Prevent agenda'. 

Following the revised 2011 strategy, since 2012, Prevent has been delivered by a local inter-faith centre in Leicester: St Philips Centre. The St Philips Centre has a particular focus on integration initiatives; indeed it also ran the DCLG's 'Near Neighbours' programme, with responsibility for distributing funding for cross-community initiatives aimed at promoting cohesion. Consequently, Leicester has tended to have a strong focus on an inter-faith, collaborative and integration/cohesion based approach to understanding and implementing Prevent.

Tower Hamlets: a cohesion approach

In Tower Hamlets, the local implementation of the 2007 Prevent strategy was, as in many other cities, closely aligned to the community cohesion agenda, with relatively less emphasis on hard-edge security. Thus, local agencies and community organisations drew down funding to enable youth work, women's projects and inclusion initiatives among Muslim communities. Consequently, prior to 2010, only four of the 28 Prevent projects funded in Tower Hamlets were related to 'hard edge' security concerns, with the rest largely focused on community cohesion and social inclusion objectives. As a local Prevent Manager in Tower Hamlets reflected, under Labour: 'Prevent was led very autonomously to a large degree' and that 'each local authority took it in some way which it felt was best'. 

In 2012, the projects that were proposed by Tower Hamlets under the government's new approach were initially rejected by central government as 'too cohesion oriented'. Subsequently, Tower Hamlets Council set out to create locally-shaped projects that served its aims along with those of central government, such as the 'No Place for Hate' programme, which excluded extremist preachers while also emphasising local cohesion in the face of threats from the far right. Tower Hamlets, then, tended to draw on well-developed relationships with community organisations and actors to develop an approach to Prevent that was responsive to local concerns.

Birmingham: a securitized approach

By contrast, in Birmingham, the implementation of Prevent was much more contested. From the outset, Birmingham City Council raised few objections to implementing the 2007 Prevent strategy, and in the early days did secure cooperation from some Muslim organisations. But suspicion towards Prevent began to arise fairly soon after its inception. In particular, perceptions that community engagement under Prevent was police-led arose due to the secondment of a police officer from the regional Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) into the City Council's Equalities Division to take the lead on Prevent inside the Council. By 2010, suspicion towards Prevent intensified due to 'Project Champion'. Whilst not itself a Prevent initiative, Project Champion did much to undermine Prevent. Project Champion was a police surveillance operation involving installation of 216 closed-circuit television (CCTV) and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras (overt and covert) in two areas of Muslim settlement in Birmingham, creating a 'surveillance ring' around these areas. Importantly, the counter-terrorism purpose of the cameras was concealed from local residents, with the cameras badged as a 'crime safety initiative' and its consultation with local community subsequently criticized by a Thames Valley Police Report. The revelation of the counter-terrorism purpose of Project Champion had damaging implications for Prevent. By 2011, there were very high levels of suspicion of Prevent, with few projects underway, such that for many Prevent came to be regarded, in the words of one interviewee, as 'dead in this city'. Muslim community engagement in Birmingham, then, has tended to be hampered by both the dominance of the security paradigm, and limited and top-down approaches to community engagement by the city council. 

Conclusion

These case studies suggest that local models and practices of engagement with Muslim communities vary in approach (as well as in quality). Importantly, where engagement was reconceived in broader terms than those set out by the Prevent agenda, and where models and practices responded to local contexts, and created scope for Muslim civil society actors to shape initiatives and agendas, engagement initiatives tended to achieve better collaboration and participation from Muslim communities. 

The findings suggest that local mechanisms and structures for Muslim civic engagement are important, and can contribute to a range of agendas - including integration, cohesion, equalities, and security and counterterrorism. Importantly, such engagement is improved where actors do not confine engagement to the needs of a security or counter extremism agenda, and are responsive to local issues and concerns.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key recommendations 

1. The promotion of Muslim civic engagement is beneficial for a range of agendas (including integration, cohesion, equalities and counter-terrorism), but it should not be subsumed within a counter-extremism agenda.

2. Multiple mechanisms for Muslim civic engagement need to be developed - from local to national level.

3. These need to be open to a range of perspectives and participants (including a range of different voices, women, young people, and new migrant groups).

4. Promoting Muslim civic engagement will require commitment and resources.

5. The promotion of mechanisms for Muslim civic engagement at local level should allow for locally-sensitive models and practices to emerge - a one-size-fits-all approach will not work.
