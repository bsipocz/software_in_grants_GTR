The interplay between ML, statistics and numerical optimisation is becoming increasingly fruitful. In particular, the understanding of optimisation within ML is a process that has just begun and has recently received most of the attention. This project will consider challenging optimisation issues in the context of matrix learning in ML. Most of the research in this area has been based on &amp;quot;recycling&amp;quot; knowledge and general-purpose softwares acquired from numerical optimisation research. In other words, their special structures related to specific ML tasks are largely ignored which hampers their applications to large-scale datasets. At the same time, the modern technologies are creating a huge number of high-dimensional and large-scale datasets, which is particularly true in industry, e-commerce, life science and computer vision. We believe that it is now the time to build on the success of the existing approaches to develop a new generation of matrix learning methods for high-dimensional and large-scale data analysis. The main theme in this proposal is to develop a completely new eigenvalue optimisation framework for various matrix learning problems in ML by exploring their special convex structures. This new framework will not only provide new insights into matrix learning problems in ML but also, most importantly, the beautiful mathematics underlying eigenvalue optimisation will greatly facilitate the design of efficient algorithms. More powerful ML methodologies than generic SDP solvers and exiting first-order methods will arise from the innovative interaction between ML and eigenvalue optimization. Therefore, the proposed research theme represents a significant shift in emphasis.

Specifically, this proposal aims to develop a new line of matrix learning methods in ML by exploring their special structures in convex optimisation which includes developing new models, designing efficient optimisation algorithms and rigorously establishing their convergence characteristics. Extensive empirical studies will be carried out to illustrate the potential of the new methods developed and refine the state-of-the-art results. In particular, we will implement the algorithms by means of user-friendly software tools, and apply them on two large and challenging application problems: face identification (e.g. Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset from Yahoo News) and collaborative filtering (prediction of users' preferences to products).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term, the project will have an immediate impact on different groups of researchers (machine learning, statistics, numerical optimisation) named as academic beneficiaries and development of the PDRA. In particular, the collaboration with Prof. Charles Micchelli will create a new path of impact across a wide range of academic communities and lead to additional dissemination paths outside of the UK. 

As the collection of massive data sets expands in all areas of industry and administration, machine learning methodologies are increasingly making their way into industrial applications. For instance, they are extremely useful in information security and crime prevention (e.g. in fraud detection, spam email detection, people identification) and in the retail sector (e.g. prediction of users' preference data), to name but a few. The availability of powerful computers and the development of new models and algorithms in this proposal will definitely accelerate this process. Thus, while the research to be undertaken under the remit of this proposal will have an immediate impact on the research community, it will also make a less immediately measurable but even more important impact on the way our economy and society evolve. 

To increase the likelihood of the impacts, serious efforts will be made to engage and reach the different target audiences. In particular, we will publish papers in prestigious academic journals, give presentations at leading conferences which attract many attendees from industry, hold consultation meetings with potential industrial users, maintain an up-to-date website of the project and organize workshops as part of computing outreach activities for secondary school students.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>At the current stage, we have developed a new eigenvalue optimisation formulation for various matrix learning problems in machine learning by exploring their structures in convex optimization. Eigenvalue optimisation is a special SDP problem and its theory is extensively exploited in engineering design and applied mathematics. From the innovative interaction between machine learning and eigenvalue optimization, we developed novel and efficient first-order algorithms for large-scale matrix learning which only need the computation of the largest eigenvector of matrices. We also established the convergence rate of the developed algorithms and are carrying out empirical studies to implement them on real-life applications such as colloborative filtering (Netflix dataset). 



These key findings have been published in three leading journals in machine learning including Journal of Machine Learning Research, Neural Computation and Machine Learning Journal, and two top-ranking conferences including the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), the Europe Conference of Machine Learning (ECML).</gtr:description><gtr:id>93FC964E-0964-4725-B3C7-E9B5E85AF577</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4348716432.5534527797c6c6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>008315A7-C46F-40D3-8CD6-C41B25C25F0F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generalization bounds for metric and similarity learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Machine Learning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c5a0dcfb9248ab3b428acba57b7bfec"><gtr:id>5c5a0dcfb9248ab3b428acba57b7bfec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cao Q</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_9408179218136c32a8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B2FD03E-0F98-43C0-AD76-62D9DC2F3509</gtr:id><gtr:title>Similarity Metric Learning for Face Recognition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/87d50911ce9fb1d6e428868d1d017f0e"><gtr:id>87d50911ce9fb1d6e428868d1d017f0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yiming Ying (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_8667093717140b5158</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A49F9C8-51A6-4C62-A202-A4CFFE9B373B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distance Metric Learning with Eigenvalue Optimization</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebf175cca1edcf150628f982120315e6"><gtr:id>ebf175cca1edcf150628f982120315e6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ying Yiming</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1532-4435</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a34fe03a9c6c9.59681942</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>330BCCEB-2FE6-49D5-A4AB-B352C44E790C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Distance Metric Learning with Eigenvalue Optimization</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Machine Learning Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/87d50911ce9fb1d6e428868d1d017f0e"><gtr:id>87d50911ce9fb1d6e428868d1d017f0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yiming Ying (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_767669362913842fac</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE092762-95DC-4DD4-806A-7924BC4BD1D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Guaranteed classification via regularized similarity learning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neural computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/673ab7a31e6bb39ec543132ecd0d4e10"><gtr:id>673ab7a31e6bb39ec543132ecd0d4e10</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guo ZC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0899-7667</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>m_58521447841375df4c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J001384/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
