&lt;p>Public outreach is emerging as a key area of activity for war crimes courts that seek to build trust in new legal populations with victims, witnesses and veterans. The research will focus in particular on the attempt by the CBiH to establish a Court Support Network (CSN) in 2005, comprising six non-governmental organisations (NGOs) distributed across the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In policy terms the research will establish the extent to which public outreach activities can assist in developing trust in trial processes, establishing the legitimacy of new judicial instruments and fostering popular participation in judicial institutions.&lt;/p>

This research has come at a crucial time for the transitional justice process in Bosnia. The Court of Bosnia in Sarajevo, established in 2006, has been granted increasing responsibility for war crimes trials, creating the opportunity for renewed societal debate concerning the nature of justice after the 1992-5 war. But at the same time, political attacks on the court from domestic politicians have grown, while victims' associations are turning away from the legal process in frustration at a perceived lack of transparency. In this context the research has explored how the Court has sought to build trust amongst Bosnian communities through public outreach strategies, often fostering links with civil society organisations. Over the course of the fieldwork we have enrolled civil society organisations as participants in research design, culminating in a workshop in central Sarajevo co-organised with the NGO Action Against Impunity (TRIAL). This event brought together Court officials, members of the international community, NGOs and victim associations to debate new approaches to communicating law. The research has led to a series of far-reaching impacts: the behaviour of NGOs and victims associations has changed as they have adopted new methods for corresponding with the Court, the Court has transformed how it engages civil society organisations and a series of international agencies have begun to engage in processes of transitional justice in Bosnia.

In the UK context, my research has had various impacts. I used an ESRC Impact Acceleration Award to explore the relationship between the findings in the Bosnian context and current UK policy towards reform of the court estate (see funding applications for details). The first two (of three) workshops involved judges, NGOs, members of the Ministry of Justice and academics deliberating the future of the UK court estate. The third workshop was held inside Wandsworth Prison and brought twenty external delegates to discuss issues of concerning court space and the communication of law with inmates. Finally, the research has been drawn upon by the Ministry of Defence 77 Brigade to shape their interventions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB7614AE-ACCF-41B0-B000-136CE0B2E86A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54575f37dce171.39154100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(1) Hybrid Law: incorporating concepts of spatial hybridity in a study of transitional justice has theoretical and methodological implications. In theoretical terms, it emphasizes the entanglement of legal deliberation in specific material and symbolic landscapes. In methodological terms it encourages qualitative engagement with the materiality of trials, illuminating the forms of comportment and categorization through which law establishes its legitimacy. Outputs: papers in Annals of the AAG (in press) and The Geographical Journal. Presentations at in Sheffield, Tuzla and Los Angeles. The PI received Stanley D. Brunn Award from the Political Geography Speciality Group of the Association of American Geographers for contributions to work on the political geographies of international law. 

(2) Transitional citizenship: the project found that the operation of the CBiH illuminated a series of divergent understandings of citizenship. While the court seeks to convey a concept of state-based citizenship, this is only achieved through the enrolment of civil society actors operating across Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) territory. Rather than heralding a series of 'grassroots' alternatives to official scripts, these agents often saw the value of a universal understanding of justice structured around state-based rights. Outputs: paper under review at Political Geography (&amp;quot;Using courts to build states&amp;quot;), a book chapter in an international edited collection on transitional justice and civil society. Presentations in New York and Cambridge. 

(3) Law and state building: the project has illuminated the limits to using courts to build states, emphasizing the ways in which the operation of law imposes social categories that can act as a barrier to the consolidation of new political communities. Outputs: book chapters in The Improvised State monograph, a chapter in 'weak states in Eurasia' edited collection and presentations in Exeter, Belfast and Switzerland.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Localising International Law research project has had a series of impacts on the relationship between legal institutions and victim communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These will be taken forward in a number of ways:

First, the outputs of the project have changed the policy of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) towards civil society organisations. In January 2012, and as a direct result of participation in the workshop, the Court opened direct dialogues with victims associations and human rights NGOs in order to improve public accessibility to war crimes trials. In a letter to the PI the President of the Court of BiH, Justice Medd?ida Kreso, described how the activities of the project have &amp;quot;significantly contribute[d] to the efforts made by the Court to be proactive&amp;quot;. 

Secondly, the research has transformed the culture of debate surrounding transitional justice amongst international organisations in Bosnia. A participant in the Sarajevo workshop from the ICTY remarked &amp;quot;the workshop offered a clear message that victims of crime have to come back to the centre of social attention [] because in the current social reality perpetrators enjoy many more benefits offered by the judicial system than the victims.&amp;quot; A representative of the US Department of Justice saw the research project and the workshop as a crucial intervention in debates concerning transitional justice in Bosnia: &amp;quot;the attendees were true stakeholders; to hear about their specific experiences and views was extremely useful.&amp;quot; The research findings will be taken forward by these policy actors to refine the approach towards civil society organisations within transitional justice programmes. 

Thirdly, through the participatory research strategy and the dissemination activities, civil society actors have developed a new strategy of working with the Court. In particular, organisations have begun to directly lobby the Court for better access and information. As a result of these processes (in addition to wider campaigns), in 2014 the Court altered its approach to data protection and brought to an end of redacting indictments and verdicts to allow greater transparency concerning trial outcomes. 

Fourthly, the research will be taken forward by social scientists interested in the mechanisms through which courts (both conventional domestic courts and institutions of transitional justice) communicate their aims and activities. The findings of the project point to the significance of understanding law as a form of socially-embedded practice, where the sites and characteristics of its performance play an important role in public perceptions of justice. This contributes to critical legal scholarship that has sought to challenge a disembodied and instrumental account of law.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>61BD5C11-BF27-4AD5-B445-EE9E5D417248</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545762205c0427.06769136</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/lilbosnia/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Changing public outreach policy of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</gtr:description><gtr:id>9D0DA0A4-A5C1-41AB-88B2-15D8A430E59A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over the course of the fieldwork the project enrolled civil society organisations as participants in research design, culminating in a workshop in central Sarajevo co-organised with the NGO Action Against Impunity (TRIAL).

The research has led to a series of far-reaching impacts: in particular the Court has transformed how it engages civil society organisations by instituting regular discussion fora with such groups within the Court building. This has the benefit -- stressed at the workshop -- of demystifying the Court space and allowing victims' associations the chance to ask specific questions regarding the legal process.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8647645263.60449621f3d9a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory
