Institutions such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) set guidelines which influence resource allocation decisions in the NHS and social care. Decisions by NICE are informed by clinical evidence and economic evaluation. Economic evaluation is the systematic comparison of different interventions/options in terms of both their costs and their impact on the service user. Currently, in the NHS, impact is defined in terms of increased life expectancy and improved health functioning. However, the focus on health is problematic in the case of social care, which is broader in its scope and impact. Social care aims to help people to retain their dignity and independence (hence being able to live an active life).

Some economists have begun to explore a different framework for the economic evaluation of social care, one that is based upon the capability approach. The term capability reflects a person's ability to be and achieve the broad things that they value. Questionnaires have been developed to measure wellbeing in terms of capability. One such questionnaire is the ICECAP-A, which assesses a person's capability to experience security, autonomy, enjoyment, love and friendship, and achievement in life. By asking service users to complete the questionnaire we can assess what impact a service has had on their wellbeing (wellbeing in a broader sense than just health functioning). The ICECAP-A is one of a small number of questionnaires recommended for use by NICE for the evaluation of social care.

Research into the capability approach is still at a relatively early stage. When evaluating healthcare using health functioning there is a clear way of presenting information to decision-makers and clear rules that decision-makers follow when deciding whether fund a new treatment. The aim of this project is to develop a way of presenting capability information to decision-makers and to provide evidence on the public's preferences, to help guide decisions in the social care/public health contexts.

The first phase of the project will answer the question &amp;quot;what level of wellbeing should be deemed by society as 'sufficient', if those experiencing levels of wellbeing below this are prioritised for state funded support?&amp;quot; The question will be addressed by members of the public in a series of six citizens' workshops. We will recruit 12-15 people per workshop by sending invitation letters to those on the edited electoral register, working with charities and community groups and via social media. We will provide participants with relevant background information and encourage them to discuss their thoughts in order to reach a group consensus. 2-3 participants from each workshop will take part in an additional workshop to arrive at a final consensus, a consensus from across the six groups. The output will be to define a meaningful and standard quantity of benefit (an improvement from no capability at all up to a sufficient level of capability).

We will then conduct a further six citizens' workshops with a new sample of the public. The question to be addressed by participants in phase II will be: &amp;quot;how much (in monetary terms) is our standard unit of benefit worth to society?&amp;quot; I.e. how much is society willing to pay to improve a person's wellbeing from no capability to sufficient capability?

Deliberation means participants can be informed about the context and share and challenge each other's views in a supportive environment. Experiences of participating in the workshops will be understood through individual follow-up interviews; this will be published to inform the design of future studies.

We will contrast results from the public workshops with separate results from three policy-maker workshops and from individual responses to an online survey. In such a survey, respondents have less scope to consider and form their views.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The capability approach is a normative framework which forms a basis for measuring wellbeing. There is increasing interest in using the capability approach in contexts of social care and public health, where reliance on a narrow assessment of health functioning will provide a partial view of the effects of interventions (which are typically broader in their scope and impact). However, as a conceptual framework, the capability approach is incomplete. One unresolved question relates to the choice of decision-rule. Maximisation of health gain is used by NICE; various forms of shortfall sufficiency have been advocated by some capability theorists.

The ICECAP-A is one capability measure recommended by NICE for evaluating social care interventions. Tariff values exist for the ICECAP-A, elicited through best-worst scaling and anchored between zero (no capability) and one (full capability). I will use public deliberation methods to elicit a monetary threshold value for use with ICECAP-A.

The first phase of the project will involve the public in setting a sufficient level of capability, a level below which individuals would be prioritised for state funded support. The existing tariff values can then be rescaled such that zero is equivalent to no capability and one is equivalent to sufficient capability. From this, we can adopt a common metric of years of sufficient capability.

The next phase (again using deliberative methods, but with the public and policy-makers) will elicit an arbitrated societal monetary value for a gain in wellbeing of one year of sufficient capability. This value can be used as the social care equivalent to the &amp;pound;20k-&amp;pound;30k QALY threshold, adopted by NICE for healthcare.

An aggregation of individually formed values, elicited through an online survey, will be compared to the arbitrated social value from the workshops. The arbitrated monetary threshold will be applied to a number of case studies where existing data is available.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The intended impact of this research is to directly inform a framework within which decision-makers and commissioners can assess the value of social care and public health interventions. Through achievement of that primary impact, the research will also: (i) help to deliver better value for the taxpayer; (ii) improve the quality of services through the better integration of health and social care; and (iii) deliver greater consistency and hence fairness for service users.

The final report of the Independent Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care, published by the King's Fund, begins with a frank acknowledgement of the &amp;quot;huge pressures facing the NHS and social care at a time of growing demands and constrained resources&amp;quot;. For example, adult social care is the largest area of direct spending for Birmingham City Council. Given that resources are constrained, NICE provides guidelines to inform the allocation of health resources. A specific intervention is likely to be recommended for use if the cost of achieving a gain equivalent to one QALY falls within or below a threshold of &amp;pound;20,000 to &amp;pound;30,000.

The objective of providing social care is different from that of providing health, with more focus on retaining the service user's dignity and independence. This has led NICE to recommend that social care interventions are evaluated against a separate set of outcomes, for example those outcomes assessed by the ICECAP-A.

It is often suggested that there should be better integration of health and social care. The Independent Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care suggest that better integration of health and social care services &amp;quot;is likely to lead to better use of resources and thus better value for money&amp;quot;. Qualitative work conducted as part of an ongoing ERC funded project on the economics of end of life care indicates that fragmented and disjointed services creates additional stress for service users and informal carers. The use of different evaluate frameworks in different sectors is a barrier to greater integration. For example, a threshold such as that used by NICE in the context of health does not exist in other sectors. Work has been conducted by Brazier and Tsuchiya on behalf of the MRC to identify a number of options with which to &amp;quot;address the problem of using multiple outcome measures to inform resource allocation within and between sectors&amp;quot;.

The research proposed in this application will generate a monetary threshold for a year of sufficient capability, based upon assessment of capability wellbeing using the ICECAP-A. The research will therefore allow comparison of the effectiveness of interventions using a common metric: money. The Independent Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care recommended &amp;quot;making much more social care free at the point of use...[f]irst [to] those whose needs are currently defined as 'critical'... [and], as the economy improves, free social care should be extended to those with 'substantial' needs.&amp;quot; If more social care is provided freely at the point of consumption, commissioned publicly rather than provided by a complex mix of private and third sector providers, there will be greater scope to direct resources according to the principles of efficiency and equity. As the scope for economic evaluation increases, the importance of a monetary threshold akin to that already used in the health sector will increase. The project proposed in this application will directly inform the setting of such a threshold by providing evidence of the societal value of a gain in wellbeing, defined in such a way that is immediately relevant to public health and social care.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Summary of results</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>884B911A-8582-4A0E-B225-584464F78873</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lay summary of results from task (objective) 1 of the research, printed and posted to those who participated in the task citizens' workshops.
