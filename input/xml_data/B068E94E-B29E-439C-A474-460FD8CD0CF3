All cells contain the same information. The immense variety of cell types in the human body, each with distinct functions is achieved by changing the way this information is read, or &amp;quot;expressed&amp;quot;. In eukaryotes, such as humans, DNA is folded and compacted into manageable units by wrapping like thread around a spool composed of proteins called histones, to form chromatin. These manageable units, called nucleosomes, offer an additional level of information to the cell as the histone proteins at their core can be selectively modified by the incorporation of acetate, phosphate, methyl or other chemical groups. These histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) can act as so-called epigenetic &amp;quot;marks&amp;quot; to encode additional information in the genome. These marks can function to tether or recruit enzyme complexes that either silence or allow gene expression. By varying the distribution of histone post-translational modifications, and their ability to be read or decoded, genes can be selectively turned off or on in cells, controlling the development and function of cells. We seek to understand how this occurs as many human diseases, such as cancers and lymphomas, are triggered by altered or disordered gene expression. By understanding these epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation, new therapies to cure disease can be developed. 

In our research, we use both human cell lines and the &amp;quot;model organism&amp;quot; Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies). Although at first glance it may not seem so, Drosophila and humans have evolved from a common ancestor and thus share many design principals. A useful analogy is to compare a high-performance racing car and a child's go-kart. Although one is more sophisticated, the basic elements of control - steering and brakes - are the same. In the same way, Drosophila uses many of the same mechanisms to control gene expression as humans. As such, we can use Drosophila as a stand-in for humans, a so-called &amp;quot;model organism&amp;quot;. This is useful as it allows us to do experiments that are impossible or unethical in humans, for example deliberately deleting or altering genes to determine their role in development. In our work we use fly strains in which we can tag, alter or delete (&amp;quot;knock-out&amp;quot;) the protein complexes that establish and interpret epigenetic marks to determine their function in gene regulation. 

In this study we will determine how the distribution of a key epigenetic regulator called NURF is affected by histone post-translational modifications. We will determine how NURF then alters the positions of nucleosomes. By changing the position of nucleosomes NURF can affect the interaction of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that &amp;quot;expresses&amp;quot; genes) with DNA. To do this we will use a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to fish-out regions of the Drosophila genome to which NURF is targeted and identify these by determining their DNA sequence using a DNA sequencer that can sequence millions of DNA fragments in one go. We will examine whether NURF recruitment correlates with the presence of histone-modifications. Subsequently we will determine whether NURF recruitment to these regions is able to affect the activities of RNA polymerase by using the same technique of ChIP-Seq to map the distribution of RNA polymerase on genes in cells that contain or lack the NURF regulator and the histone modifications to which NURF can bind.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Regulated changes in chromatin structure and dynamics have a key role in controlling transcription by restricting RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment to normal transcription start sites (TSSs) at the 5' end genes, and controlling the processive elongation of Pol II into the gene body. Chromatin dynamics are controlled by the concerted actions of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes and histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs). In this proposal I will investigate how HPTMs act as molecular rheostats to control binding of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler (NURF), and how NURF regulates both transcription elongation and the suppression of cryptic initiation. I have developed experimental methods to knock-out chromatin regulators specifically in Drosophila macrophages, and then purify sufficient quantities of these cells for high-resolution ChIP-Sequencing and transcriptome analysis. I will exploit this system to:

i. Examine how a combination of the H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, H3S10p and H4K16Ac HPTMs control recruitment of NURF to the +1 nucleosome on active genes.
ii. Determine function of H3K9Ac, H3S10p and H4K16Ac on NURF recruitment by knocking-out the H3K9 and H4K16 histone acetyltransferases and H3S10 kinase. 
iii. Map Pol II distributions in control and NURF knock-out macrophages to determine NURF functions in elongation and cryptic initiation.
iv. Use total RNA-Seq and CAGE-Seq to show changes in transcription elongation and cryptic initiation in NURF knock-out macrophages. 
v. Confirm that loss of NURF alters recruitment of components of the Set2/Rpd3 pathway that suppresses cryptic initiation in the wake of elongating Pol II.

This research will show how combinations of HPTMs act as rheostats to dynamically tune chromatin remodelling by NURF and control transcription. Understanding the interplay between HPTMs, chromatin remodelling and Pol II activity will help in the development of new strategies for therapeutic intervention in disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research aims to provide evidence for existence of combinations of histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs) that can act as rheostats to regulate recruitment of nuclear factors to chromatin. This data enhances the knowledge economy by providing new insights into the lexicon of the epigenetic code. Data generated here will have obvious benefit to researchers in the field of chromatin and epigenetics, including not only our existing collaborators, partners in the EpiCentre epigenetics consortium in Birmingham, but a substantial global body of researchers. The size of this community is indicated by the growing number of research publications that have been generated in this field, 30,164 to date. 

This research benefits workers in disease fields such as Cancer Biology and Inflammation. HPTMs and chromatin remodelling and modifying enzymes that interpret them are emerging disease targets. A survey by Business Insights, &amp;quot;Innovations in Epigenetics: Advances in Technologies, Diagnostics &amp;amp; Therapeutics,&amp;quot; deduced that the current market in so-called epigenetic medicine to be valued $560 million, derived from the sale of the anticancer products Dacogen, Vidaza, and Zolinza, with 30 epigenetic drugs under development. Our research offers an alternative way to target HPTMs and disease. Rather than removing marks it may be feasible to mask HPTMs by modification of flanking residues or by competing interactions with histone tail mimics - multiply modified tails with enhanced affinity for domains. These approaches offer attractive new paradigms for epigenetic medicine that have will broad general interest. By opening up new potential avenues to target chromatin pathways, our research will have considerable impact in this lucrative market. 

A clear route to exploit advances made during our research is through our existing contacts with industry. We have links (including joint MRC CASE PhD fellowship applications) with the company Cellzome, which utilizes Episphere bead technology to study nuclear factors. Through our current CRUK-funded research we have links to Cancer Research Technology (CRUK's technology transfer arm). CRT has entered into a collaboration with AstraZeneca to pursue drug development in the field of cancer metabolism, drawing on expertise in fields including epigenetics. In addition, Birmingham has been selected as one of the centers of the &amp;quot;Translational Research Partnerships&amp;quot; previously known as &amp;quot;Therapeutic Capability Clusters&amp;quot;. These provide mechanisms by which industry can engage in early phase development of novel compounds. Both CRT and the capability clusters provide contact pathways of impact to companies like AstraZeneca, which have interests in developing epigenetics targeting medicines. Through these mechanisms our research will help to enhance the research capacity and knowledge of industry, potentially contributing to wealth creation and prosperity. 

Support for our research will synergize with investment in next-generation technology by Birmingham University. Technology and expertise mastered by this facility will have long-term benefits for future UK academic partners. To support future technological expansion in the field of epigenetic medicine, it is paramount that UK knowledge base in these technologies be maintained by supporting UK-based centers of excellence. A key remit of our sequencing core is to use high-throughput sequencing to understand the control and function of the epigenome. This, in concert with the Birmingham EpiCentre epigenetics consortium will help establish a set of skilled researchers to provide a strong science base. This will make a significant contribution to the UK knowledge economy by delivering and training highly skilled researchers in key technologies that will be critical to the development of the field of epigenetic therapeutics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>379432</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>NURF live imaging</gtr:description><gtr:id>575F3E0E-A576-4CEE-A577-9300844CC157</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visualisation of NURF remodeller localisation and dynamics in live cells</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e05eefc92aa6.12805806-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to microscope facilities and dye labels allowing single molecule imaging</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Generation of tagged NURF301 strains allowing single molecule imaging of chromatin remodelling enzymes.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Minnesota</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Applied Economics</gtr:department><gtr:description>NURF inhibitors</gtr:description><gtr:id>B5152641-FCF3-4F81-AC99-0D1717887F19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing collaboration.

Performed CAGE-Seq of hemocytes from wild-type and NURF mutant backgrounds.
Performed NURF ChIP-Seq from hemocytes.
Mapped histone post-translational modifications in hemocytes.

We have also mapped NURF localisation and defined NURF target nucleosomes by MNase-Seq. Our data show that, besides anticipated roles at enhancers, NURF interacts physically and functionally with the TRF2/DREF basal transcription factor to organize nucleosomes downstream of active promoters. Moreover, we detect NURF remodeling and recruitment at distal insulator sites, where NURF functionally interacts with and co-localizes with DREF and insulator proteins including CP190 to establish nucleosome-depleted domains. This insulator function of NURF is most apparent at subclasses of insulators that mark the boundaries of chromatin domains, where multiple insulator proteins co-associate. By visualizing the complete repertoire of in vivo NURF chromatin targets our data provide new insights into how chromatin remodeling can control genome organization and regulatory interactions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Particular outcomes of the award related to histone post-translational binding by NURF is currently being extended to the development of reader blocker drugs that can be used to down-regulate NURF function.
