Previous research shows that the availability of social networks improves the quality of life of older people. Nevertheless such an approach to social policy can have unintended effects. Informal and family based social care can contribute to the deterioration of the health of carers and disrupt their career. This implies that government must maintain a careful equilibrium between sustaining social network care and providing accessible care services that can work in partnership with these networks.&lt;/p>

The interaction between family networks and other social networks will also be evaluated.

In terms of contact with family, friends and participation in social groups and organisations, the data revealed a divide between Southern and Eastern European countries (and Austria) on the one hand and Northern and Western European and non-European English speaking countries on the other. Respondents from the former group tended to have greater levels of family contact, a smaller number of friends and less likelihood of involvement in social organisations. Social network patterns in Japan, being the only Asian country in the sample, differed from both these clusters, having the highest proportion living in multiple person households, but a low level of contact with family with whom they did not reside. 

 

In all countries the majority of respondents (74%) saw a close relative at least once a week, although the country average varied between 89% in Spain and Italy to only 66% in New Zealand. All countries agreed on the importance of the spouse as a source of support although rates of marriage and widowhood varied considerably



Gender differences

Across all the countries, women had on average greater frequency of contact with family than men, whilst overall men had higher social participation rates than women even when controlling for age. In most countries, men also reported more close friends on average, but paradoxically men were also more likely to report having no close friend, and to see their closest friend less frequently than women.



Attitudinal variations

The ISSP included a number of attitudinal questions, including whether adult children have a duty to look after elderly parents. Countries with higher levels of family contact were more likely to have above average levels of agreement with this statement.



Paid employment

Levels of close family contact were on average marginally lower among employed persons. Working was found to have a positive effect on non-familial social networking, in particular involvement in social and community groups. No evidence was therefore found that working in older life undermines the increased social networking that is often aspired to through retirement and voluntary early retirement. Paid employment was more likely amongst the non European sample, and northern Europeans.



Social expenditure on care

A negative association was found between social expenditure on care in countries and the average level of family contact, and between expenditure and the proportion living in multiple person households in each country. However, this association was dependent upon the extreme cases of regimes with particularly high and low expenditure. When these are excluded from the analysis, this association is not evident. On the contrary, to some extent, it can be argued that strong family networks within countries are not necessarily incompatible with comparatively generous public social care provision. Austria is an example of a country with strong family networks accompanied by higher levels of expenditure. Over 81% of the sample in Austria saw an adult child at least once a week, compared to an average of 73% in the 18 countries. Austria had above average OECD expenditure on long term care as a proportion of the population over 80 in 2001 and a developing profile of social care services.



Impacts on policy and practice

The research findings illustrate the importance of extending community based social care policy and provision in the UK that is able to support and strengthen local family and community networks. Policy needs to facilitate caring from family, friends and communities, and promote flexibility to support differing situations in accordance with the context and preferences of users. Such policies also need to have a wider ranging impact in term of the proportion of the older population they can assist (as happens in Austria) and not be restricted to small sub groups of the population. Japan, like the UK, has less policy activity to support informal care. Policy makers need to consider the interaction of employment and retirement policies and their impact on caring activities, especially for women. Continued employment has social benefits, but pressures on people to persist in employment may be counterproductive to caring, and put increased pressures on women in particular.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Policy planning Public and social policy planning</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>336A77AA-D923-45B7-ACB5-E22B027E8E3C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5114592877.3233595b2f009a8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8AE1269-89D8-4977-B906-8DB0162E67B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Living in single person households and the risk of isolation in later life</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Ageing and Later Life</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c576f6a2deb44e2f5aa218e77af84a2e"><gtr:id>c576f6a2deb44e2f5aa218e77af84a2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Banks L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfaefae7a38849</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>276D68AB-1061-4813-8999-EBB55369462C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The relationship between employment and social networks in the older population</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Social Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91"><gtr:id>32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haynes P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9e1dac7e67.49581886</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>73447028-4520-4B4F-85CB-F072BE78BFA8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Ageing Societies of Central and Eastern Europe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aacd94236a857db64caf33d1503525b3"><gtr:id>aacd94236a857db64caf33d1503525b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perek, Jolanta</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9788323325772</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-1675840608.47371863b877ec8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4D885A5C-E5EF-4EF7-8DF7-2C14AA2F33A8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Older People's Family Contacts and Long-term Care Expenditure in OECD Countries: A Comparative Approach Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Policy &amp; Administration</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91"><gtr:id>32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haynes P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa3fa33520e7e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7225B898-42C6-4761-AFDB-E964D86668EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social networks amongst older people in OECD countries: a qualitative comparative analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of International and Comparative Social Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91"><gtr:id>32f6a99fb6c3650cf6d728d0ac67cb91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haynes P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9ef9e4dc6915</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E016359/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-2114</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
