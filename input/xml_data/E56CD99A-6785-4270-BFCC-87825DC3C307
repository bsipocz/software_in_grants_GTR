One approach to resolving this conundrum is to investigate and try and understand the rules that govern the developing brain as this lays the foundation for the amazing processing power of our brains. Yet even at this stage, amongst all nerve cells jostling for position how does an individual nerve cell in the developing brain know where to go and which other nerve cells it should form connections to? After all, failure of certain cell types to do just that often results in dire consequences in terms of behaviour and is thought to underpin several severe neurological conditions including epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. At present we define two categories of nerve cell in the forebrain: excitatory pyramidal cells and local, inhibitory nerve cells termed interneurons. Although the latter are only a minor component of the total number of cells in the brain, they are critical to normal function. The basis of this proposal is a novel approach reliant on the power of genetics to interrogate the contribution of interneurons to emergent brain activity and dissect when and how they might go wrong in models that replicate some of the molecular deficiencies associated with schizophrenia. The purpose: to gain an understanding of the simple, early brain that will (1) establish a set of rules for the more complex mature brain; (2) provide the foundation for a better understanding of these interneuron-related neurological conditions. This approach has proven hard to pursue in the past due to the dynamic nature of the developing brain and the difficulty in targeting specific cells. To overcome this, we will make use of genes crucial for cell identity. Our recent findings have revealed that the fate of a cell is specified early on in the embryo in response to a genetic code, which acts through a cascade of checkpoints to generate the diversity present in the adult. We have begun to crack this code and are now able to pinpoint where and when interneuron are born. Unfortunately from then on the story is still largely incomplete and we have a limited knowledge of how specific classes of interneuron become functional in the newborn brain. This is important because several neurological conditions such as schizophrenia have been linked to deficits in just one or two cell types. Using the bits of code we already know we can identify the same cells time and time again, target our research more effectively and ask important question as to the role of select interneurons to the developing brain. We have the technology to record from individual cells and relate their activity to that of the surrounding brain regions. We hope to use our strategy to follow certain cells, unravel their contribution to early brain function and reveal how and when these cells are directed to assume a particular role. Our initial data points to a critical window early in postnatal life during which we may be able to intervene using either pharmacological or cell based therapy means to restore a degree of normality to the emergent functional network. By resolving this further we will have the cornerstone to probe the newborn brain in more detail, understand how a simple layer of cells in the embryo matures into the amazingly complex adult brain and perhaps open the door to novel therapeutic interventions that could alleviate a range of neurodevelopmental conditions associated with interneuron deficits.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The inhibitory interneurons of the cerebral cortex are fundamental to normal cognitive function and deficits in interneuron signalling have been implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders. However our understanding of the precise role of interneurons within the developing cortex has been to a large degree hampered by their diversity. To address this question we are taking an approach that combines developmental genetics, physiology and optogenetics to probe the contribution of individual interneuron subtypes to the emergent network in both the normal and dysfunctional brain. Our recent work suggests that a transcriptional code acts to specify interneurons at the moment of neurogenesis. We intend to use our knowledge of the developmental origin of interneurons to track and determine the role of specific interneuron cohorts within the nascent neocortex. The benefit of using developmental genetics is that it provides an efficient means of identifying and interrogating interneuron function in a highly dynamic developing structure. Specifically, we will use an inducible Cre/LoxP strategy in combination with fluorescent and optogenetic reporters to track distinct populations of interneuron as they integrate into the nascent circuit both in the normal brain and those in which known molecular determinant of integration have been perturbed. To provide a comprehensive picture we will adopt a multi-faceted electrophysiological approach utilising a range of photostimulation techniques to examine the integration and downstream physiological targets of interneuron in the primordial network. These experiments will enable us to distinguish when interneuron subtypes become actively involved, and the timeframe over which they are engaged in early cortical function. The result will provide a valuable platform for researchers to go on and further dissect and understand the role of individual interneuron subtypes within the context of the emergent and mature cerebral cortex.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>GABAergic interneurons are implicated in a wide range of neurological conditions of which the two most likely to benefit from the current research proposal are drug-resistant epilepsy and schizophrenia. Prevalence of the latter in the population is thought to have a large genetic component with the neuregulin-1 gene implicated in the aetiology of the condition. Part of the proposal will directly address the contribution of various isoforms of neuregulin-1 to brain development. Schizophrenia often manifests later than other classical neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, but similarly the quality of life for patients will often remain poor. According to the 2010 NICE guidelines on mental health, mortality amongst schizophrenics is ~50% above that of the general population, with contributing factors including an increased probability of suicide and violent death but also greater prevalence of a wide range of physical health problems. This places a considerable long-term burden on the patients, their families and the healthcare system. In the NICE report it is noted that healthcare professionals often have &amp;quot;a pessimistic view of the prognosis for schizophrenia, regarding it as a severe, intractable and often deteriorating lifelong illness&amp;quot;. In terms of the burden to the populace, schizophrenia ranks among the top 10 causes of disability in developed countries worldwide (WHO). The annual cost in the UK due to lost (schizophrenia-related) working days amounts to &amp;pound;3.7 billion pounds per year, while NHS spending on treatment is on the order of &amp;pound;1.4 billion including personal social services. In terms of epilepsy there is great hope placed in the development and refinement of interneuron precursor grafts to treat pharmacologically-resistant forms of epilepsy (for example temporal lobe epilepsy) and the emergent class of interneuronopathies. Data from animal models suggest that such an approach is feasible however remarkably little is known about how interneurons iegrate and acquire functionality in the neocortex. Furthermore unless we take account of the heterogeneity of interneurons encountered in the developing and mature brain then we will always be at a disadvantage in terms of targeting and treating neurological conditions in an effective manner. In terms of eventual clinical applications, our hypothesis is that we can restore the correct developmental trajectory through genetic, pharmacological or cell based therapy. Pharmaceutical companies are already trialling drugs that attenuate excessive glutamatergic activity as a treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia. If our studies resolve that a similar approach has the potential to attenuate the underlying cause then this should be a serious consideration for further investigation. Simply put, we have the technologies and ability to better define the complexity of the developing brain. This study represents an initial step in expanding our knowledge of how specific classes of neuron acquire functionality.
In the longer term a detailed analysis of the developing cortex will pave the way for an increased understanding of the principle underlying brain function. The implications for this are widespread but it is likely to impact on a range of commercial enterprises not least the pharmaceutical industry as it will provide the basis for a whole host of new avenues for the development of better diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets. An understanding of how biological mechanisms generate complex systems has relevance beyond the traditional boundaries of the biomedical sciences as researchers- predominantly those focused on computational, mathematical, engineering and statistical research, probe the nature of information processing networks. Neurotechnology and an improved understanding of the developing brain have the potential to revolutionize the design of artificial computational systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>385980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Transgenic mouse models of schizophrenia</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6844BD1-5FD2-49E2-93B4-1F5B11E227E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have recently begun to apply laser scanning photostimulation to resolve early connections in one mouse model.
