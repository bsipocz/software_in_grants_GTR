I hope to contribute to our understanding of that era by exploring a body of artwork that was explicitly political in its engagement with the conservatism and imperialism of Gaullist France and of the Vietnam War-era United States. I will argue for the central (though heretofore unrecognised) importance of Lebel to the development of new modes of performance-based art which defined the 1960s and especially to a new wave of collaboration between Paris-based and New York-based artists in that era. Existing literature in the field is led by Roselee Goldberg's monograph Performance: Live Art Since 1960 (1998) and Kristine Stiles et al's exhibition catalogue Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949-1979 (1998). The former, however, is a broad international survey and lacking in socio-historical analysis and theoretical elaboration; the latter is a collection of essays with a relatively broad historical frame of thirty years. My aim in carrying out this research project, therefore, is to make a decisive contribution to the surprisingly slight critical literature in the field with a book which does justice to the innovation and creativity of Lebel's art, contributes to our understanding of the history of modern art and of post-war France, and enriches our knowledge of the international cultural history of the 1960s as a distinctive era.\nThe potential applications and benefits of my research project are: an innovative critical study of a relatively neglected but highly important tendency in modern art of the 1960s, the Happening. The book will be of interest to students and scholars of art history, French history and culture, and of the Sixties. It draws upon entirely new archival research and interviews relating to a body of performance-based art work about which no significant publication yet exists.\nThis research project builds upon my research monographs, Surrealism and the Politics of Eros, 1938-1968 (Thames &amp;amp; Hudson, 2005) and Eroticism and Art (Oxford University Press, 2005), both of which also examine the art and politics of post-war France. I already have considerable expertise on the art of Jean-Jacques Lebel: the fourth chapter of the former book addresses his performance '120 Minutes dedicated to the Divine Marquis' (1966); Lebel, Carolee Schneemann, Yoko Ono and performance art of the 1960s in Paris and New York are discussed in chapter 7, 'Eros and the 1960s', of the latter book. I have also published one catalogue essay and one other book chapter on Lebel: 'Outrage aux bonnes moeurs: Jean-Jacques Lebel and the Marquis de Sade', in Jean-Jacques Lebel, Paintings, Sculptures, Installations, Vienna: Museum Moderner Kunst, 1998; and 'Jean-Jacques Lebel: Anti-Sculpture and Anti-Psychiatry', in Sculpture and Psychoanalysis, Brandon Taylor (ed.), London: Henry Moore Foundation and Ashgate Publishing Company, 2006. Apart from the above, little has been published on Lebel in English, although his importance is increasingly recognised and he recently held a retrospective at the Mayor Gallery, Mayfair, London (5 November-19 December 2003).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E005071/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
