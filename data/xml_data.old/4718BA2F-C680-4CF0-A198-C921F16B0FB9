Research aiming at a better understanding of the world around us, improving the impact of our research, and ultimately benefitting the quality of life, relies on precise data. The contact-free, in-situ measurement of temperature to be developed in this project using a temperature-dependent scintillation characteristic is targeting precisely this - improving the monitoring of temperature of a protein sample holder assembly for macromolecular crystallography on the I23 beamline at the Diamond Light Source. For this purpose, a technique developed for research into the dark matter of the universe is being adapted for use at a synchrotron beamline. It involves modifications to the designs of already demonstrated equipment, fabrication of a specialized version of this equipment, systems integration and implementation at the beamline of the synchrotron. The demonstration of feasibility and quality will allow a better assessment of the wider potential of the technique.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8503</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development of non contact scintillation thermometry</gtr:description><gtr:id>62206D1B-1840-4C74-9585-E2C04A2776D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The result of this collaboration is a system for the temperature monitoring in vacuum developed for the application at a protein crystallography beamline at Diamond Light Source.

If the temperature is not controlled it may seriously compromise the quality of the experiment or even endanger the integrity of the object under study - a protein crystal. The results of the measurements of temperature dependence of scintillation decay constant for different scintillators are summarised as look-up tables. These data will be used to derive the value of temperature during the measurements. Furthermore, the studies of luminescence properties of crystals over wide temperature range complemented measurements of scintillation characteristics. This gave a getting better insight into the nature of the processes of relaxation of high energy excitations in solids.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8BC31B73-3F35-4B7C-8BEA-AB06C82F331A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b7c2fc67889.27811301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objective of this project was to develop the method of non-contact thermometry that allows monitoring of the temperature of a protein crystal sample which must be kept deeply frozen during experiments inside a vacuum vessel. A technique, enabling non-contact in situ monitoring of temperature, has been developed for the new I23 beamline at Diamond Light Source dedicated to MX experiments using long-wavelength X-rays. The temperature is derived from the luminescence decay constant of a BGO scintillation sensor exhibiting a pronounced variation of the decay time constant over a wide temperature range. One of the main virtues of the non-contact thermometry system is the elimination of all connections between the sensor and the readout system that makes it fully compatible with the necessity of swift replacement and manipulation (transfer, mounting, rotation) of the samples. The BGO scintillation sensor was calibrated over the 8 - 270 K temperature range and the accuracy of the measurements was evaluated. In the temperature range of beamline operation (30 - 150 K) the error of temperature determination is &amp;plusmn;1.6 K or less.
The measurements of temperature using different configurations and sample mounts were carried out as validation tests for the beamline thermometry system. The temperature of the sample holder measured using the luminescence sensor was found to agree with the expected value. The technique was applied to quantify the thermal performance of different sample mounts that have been used for the MX experiment at the I23 beamline. It has been shown that the magnitude of the temperature rise across the sample holder assembly varies in a wide range, i.e. from 60 to 110 K, while the temperature of the goniometer was 40 K. The obtained results not only explained previous empirical findings but also demonstrated how this technique can aid studies of the complex relationships between various parameters and factors which influence the heat conductance, and subsequently temperature, of the samples. The knowledge gained in such studies is very important for further improvement of sample holder assembly and optimisation of every stage of the sample transfer process that previously has been done by exercising a laborious and time-consuming trial-and-error approach.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The technique is ready for wider applications at Diamond Light Source and also at other synchrotrons and institutions where non-contact in situ temperature monitoring is required</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F2B180F-2D8E-4587-8E9B-4D953DF1B033</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b7b5bdadab9.73444040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The investigations of temperature variation of decay kinetics in CaMoO4 lead to the development of three-level model of the emission center in the crystals.

The method uses the conventional equation of steady-state longitudinal heat transport through the material to derive the coefficient of thermal conductivity for a given geometry of sample and temperature drop at certain distances. The method uses scintillation sensors for measurements of the temperature difference across a small sample fixed in the holder . The scintillation crystals are placed on the opposite side of the foil and are viewed by two photomultipliers through the cryostat windows. The scintillation events excited in the crystals by the alpha source are detected by the photomultiplier. The temperature of the sensors is derived from the value of the scintillation decay time constant and this allows for the thermal conductivity of the material to be calculated. The use of a non-contact method for measurements of temperature eliminates the heat leaks which are unavoidable in the case of wired temperature sensors. These leaks contribute to the errors and are very difficult for correction. Moreover, the mounting of the scintillation sensors to the sample is much more simplified, thus offering essential advantages in the case of fragile materials.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F4025BFD-D8C1-47F8-9D6F-1407E7E306CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Using this method the thermal conductivity of diamond like carbon (DLC) film with a thickness of 5x10-3 mm was measured for the first time at 20 K.

Every single pulse in the sequence corresponds to an individual photon impinging on the photocathode of the PMT. Due to the stochastic nature of the scintillation process the output PMT signal may vary widely with regard to the occurrence time of a scintillation event, the time interval between photons and the total number of detected photons in an event. Therefore, to obtain the information on timing characteristics and the light output it is necessary to record a large number of scintillation events (10^3 - 10^4) and carry out their statistical analysis. This is achieved using fast DAQ and dedicated software that allows the measurement of decay time and light yield characteristics of scintillators in one experiment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAFC9028-EA2A-4063-A396-A1118E8DFE4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The technique is well adapted for measurements of the variation in decay time constant in the range 10^-6-10^-3 s that can be observed in many scintillation materials during temperature changes.
