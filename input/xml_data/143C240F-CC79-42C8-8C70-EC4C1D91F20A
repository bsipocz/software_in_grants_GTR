In a previous EU funded project (EUWelNet http://euwelnetbroiler.eu) we have already established good working relationships with the veterinary agencies in 15 member states. The iMBDatA will be developed using existing 'sample data' to maximize the useability of current data, and used to determine requirements for a unified database and to design the interface for communication (web site and App) with end users (farmers, veterinary agenices). Data will be stored under strict security and confidentiality access rights and infrastructure.

In WP2 (Lead ES) the created protoype will be used to build a cloud based app system, and its early use will be validated on farms in UK, ES, IT. The iMBDataA tool will be validated against the 'transect ' methodology for welfare assessment, which is closely related to farmers daily check routines, and shown to have an high inter-observer reliability, and to be highly correlated with main meat quality parameters such as condemnations and downgrades at the slaughter plant (Marchewka et al., 2015). This validation work will determine the predictive capacity of the methodology for early risk assessment by conducting assessments along the rearing period (3, 5 and 6 weeks of age). The commercial participant Tecnalia (http://www.tecnalia.com/en/ict-european-software-institute/index.htm) will create the software for the Data Acquisition &amp;amp; Management Module of iMBDatA which will have the capacity to acquire data automatically from different heterogeneous datasources (app., databases and raw data from different countries), processing and normalizing the data sets, and storing them in the central data repository.

In WP3.1 (Lead FR) the protoype cloud app system will be used by producers in the partner countries (FR, ES, FI), and at slaughterhouses (IT, UK). Information on effective interfaces for the producers to use on a day to day basis will be compiled and fed back to refine the iMBDatA system. Output from the App and the webtool will guide producers as to management steps required to reduce health and welfare impacts, and so, potentially, to reduce the need for antibiotic use (a key concern and driver in EU policy). In WP3.2 we will use experimental protocols (Lead NO) to test how iMBDatA when combined with responsive and targeted enrichment, can result in positive welfare change (NO, UK, IT). The on farm studies in this WP will examine within- and between-flock variation from the same houses in relation to use of the iMBDatA tool. Statistical analysis in WP 3.1 and 3.2 will examine the statisitcal significance of welfare and health changes resulting from use of iMBData.

In WP4 (Lead FI, ALL partners) In the project http://www.euwelnet.eu/euwelnet we have already established good working relationships with the competent authority veterinary agencies in 15 member states. Member state officials will be invited to the trial iMBDatA app, and to request its use on selected farms in their member countries. 

Work package 5 (Lead UK, All partners) is integration activity &amp;amp; integration meetings which spread across all the project period and involve ALL partners to ensure that MBDatA provides information that is of value to farmers, and government, in promoting positive health and welfare change. In combination with the data being collected as part of Directive 2007/43/EC, iMBDatA will provide support for veterinary authorities, and broiler production companies in monitoring of broiler chicken health and welfare, and the potential to reduce antimicrobial use, a key current EU objective, by the detection of early disease trends through analysis of the data, and then through reactive vaccination, management and biosecurity steps.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Broiler chicken are the most abundant farmed animal in the EU, and a very important component of EU food supply. Abundant data is ALREADY COLLECTED by the member states (MS), predominately at slaughter plant level, regarding the application of the Broiler Directive 2007/43/EC. Data acquisition in itself is, however, of little value unless data collected are standardized among MS and data are further processed to produce outputs that can be use to achieve the ultimate goal of improving broiler health and welfare, and hence offering the potential to reduce antimicrobial use across the EU, a real and current concern for producers and legislators in the EU.

The iMBDatA project has partners from 6 EU countries FI, ES, IT, UK, NO, FR with a strategic North to South geographical spread iMBDatA will develop and validate a cloud based central data server provided with analytical capabilities and Apps. Through creation of algorithms and data-mining using trial data already available to the project partners, we will test (with participation from MS veterinary agencies) the use of the prototype tool on farm, during transport and slaughter. The iMBDatA system will allow producers and officials to obtain updated information on factors affecting the health and welfare of broiler flocks, and will provide them with practical tools to improve flock performance by better managing health and welfare.
We will validate the data based tool against a recognized method of on-farm welfare assessment (the transect) to ensure that iMBDatA can detect health and welfare effects, and can communicate these in an effective way to the producer. We will test how use of iMBDatA alongside targeted interventions can result in positive health and welfare change.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The strategies adopted in this project fit well within the objectives of CAP reform to increase the responsible productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector through knowledge creation and innovative approaches [9,10]. The proposed work aids the EU requirement to support the European Innovation Partnership on Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability whereby multi-actor groups at the local or regional level will link livestock and multifunctional farms with research and extension and other actors, to define problems and promote innovative and sustainable solutions.

The outcomes anticipated are:

1) Improved bird welfare in line with Directive 2007/43/EC

2) Improved productivity

3) Better disease control and potential for reduction in antimicrobial use

4) Reliable science-based data and access to expert knowledge to advise policy groups and inform decision-making

5) Production of harmonized guidance and training material leading to significant resource savings across the EU and

6) Use of a common data platform (iMBDatA)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174120</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We are in the early stages of the project and have had major project meetings in the UK (July 2016) and Spain (Nov 2016).
