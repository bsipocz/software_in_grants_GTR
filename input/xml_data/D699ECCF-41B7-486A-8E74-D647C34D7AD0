However,despite the fact that the predictions of this theory have beenrigorously tested experimentally, its mathematical foundation is stillnot fully understood. Namely, an important open problem exists on howto analytically compute the spectrum of this theory at strong coupling. Though there are computer simulations which reproduce the observed spectrum,a theoretical understanding of it is still missing.The main obstacle in computing the spectrum of Yang-Mills theory, isthat one needs to understand a system at strong coupling; nonatural small parameter exists which would allow for a standardperturbative approach. Some ten years ago, an ingenious conjecturewas proposed by Maldacena on how to address this long-standingproblem. The idea is very simple, though conceptually challenging:instead of analysing the theory in four space-time dimensions of ourworld, he proposed to consider string theory in a higher-dimensional,curved space. He conjectured that this higher-dimensional stringtheory is equivalent to the lower-dimensional theory of Yang and Millsand proposed a specific map between the two. The key point of thismap is that it inverts the coupling between the two theories: hencestrongly coupled (and hard to address) phenomena in one theory aremapped to weakly coupled (and easy to compute) phenomena in the othertheory.Though the conjecture has so far been checked in specific limits, its proof isstill lacking. Recent discoveries of integrable structures inmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (N=4 SYM)have introduced new ideas on how one could prove theconjecture. The main goal of my research is to work towards a proof ofthe string/gauge theory correspondence using these insights.The methods which will be used require a combination of severalinterdisciplinary techniques coming from integrability, quantum fieldtheory, string theory and group theory. As such, the project is verychallenging and a construction of the proof is likely to lead to newdevelopments in mathematics and physics.Although the initial conjecture was formulated for a very specificcase of Yang-Mills theory (the N=4 SYM theory) there are strongindications that the ideas should hold much more generally. Pushingthe limits of the conjecture and understanding where it breaks isanother goal of my research. Since the conjecture opened up a conceptuallynew way of looking at field theory and gravitational(i.e. geometrical) phenomena, understanding to what kind of systems itcan be applied will teach us about fundamental properties ofYang-Mills theories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345211</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project was focused on the development of (semi)analytic methods to address the open problem of dealing with strongly coupled phenomena in gauge theories. The phenomena appear in a variety of physical systems, for example in the collision of nuclei in the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN or in the interior of neutron stars.



Our main direction of research was to understand the inhomogeneous phases of cold nuclear matter using holographic methods. Due to the complexity of these systems, numerical simulations are very hard to do, and insight which is gained by the semi-analytic methods which we have found is very valuable. We have managed to understand that in the presence of various types of chemical potentials, different inhomogeneous phases can appear, which were previously not known. For example, we have understood that in the presence of an isospin chemical potential the rho meson particle can &amp;quot;condense&amp;quot;, i.e. &amp;quot;fill out the space&amp;quot;, generating a lattice-like ground state for the system. We have also investigated how introducing a magnetic field in this system modifies, and eventually destroys this phase. 



Another direction of this research was to understand how putting these systems in a finite volume &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; can modify their behaviour. For example we have computed finite-size corrections to the energy that an electron emits when passing through a complicated and strongly interacting system of quarks and gluons (the quark gluon plasma). We have also understood that putting these systems into finite volumes (as they always appear in nature) can lead to the appearance of completely novel phases, which are not present in infinite volumes commonly considered in the literature.



We have also applied some of our techniques to several solid state systems, and used

them to compute conductivities and other properties of materials.



While working on these projects, we were faced with several numerically challenging problems, which were successfully solved. In this process several pieces of code for solving coupled systems of (partial) differential equations were developed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project does not have direct applications in a non-academic context, 

except that some of its results could be used in the popularisation of science, especially amongst secondary school students.
 Various techniques developed in this research project, although initially developed to understand gauge theories, could in principle also be applied

to improve our understanding of other strongly interacting multiparticle systems, like for example those in condensed matter theory. Some developments in this direction have already been initiated in one of our publications, and were also exploited partially by other research groups.



Another byproduct of the performed research are several pieces of code for solving complicated systems of partial differential equations, which were developed in various projects. With some extra work, these can potentially be made into more general and publicly usable tools, which could be used in a variety of numerical projects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1964B1B4-F2E6-461B-AC00-7AC613B66EB5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7891737257.9609397761fa8c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BA1AFE75-AFE5-4061-AA57-22722BCB81E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mesons
