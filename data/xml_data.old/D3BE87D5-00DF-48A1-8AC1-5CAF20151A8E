And what can this tell us about ways to promote sustainability in the future? The 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in household energy consumption with the diffusion of coke and oil, natural gas and electricity. In the UK in 1974 households were responsible for 43% of electricity demand, most of it for heating space and water; thirty years earlier it had been just 7%. Unlike in industry, uncoupling energy use and growth has proved difficult in the private sphere. How did this figure get so big and how has the shift to new fuels stimulated new ways of living, and vice versa ? What can earlier moments of coping with shortages tell us about the possibilities of living with less in the future? 
Rather than looking at supply, this project focuses on consumption and the interface between people and energy systems, with the help of case studies from Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada and India. It takes seriously that demand is made up of a number of energy-hungry daily practices. We focus on the lived, material and imagined world of energy, drawing on film, objects, fiction, time-use, consumer manuals and oral history as well as official and industrial archives. The project examines how culture and energy shaped each other. The aim is to humanise energy. We study four dimensions:

1) Energy Futures: Policy makers today project forward to 2020 and 2050 anticipating future worlds. Such imagined futures have a history. We ask about their changing horizon, imagined rates of change, utopian and dystopian scenarios. Contrary to popular wisdom, shortages were a frequent source of anxiety before the 1973 oil crisis. We follow debates from the coal shortages after WWI to concerns with energy security in the 1950s to future scenarios in the 1970s and place these in their cultural and political context.

2) Disruption: Current orthodoxy sees behaviour change as difficult, if not impossible, or responsive only to &amp;quot;nudging&amp;quot;. People, it is presumed, will not tolerate change. But what if history shows this to be wrong? Before and after WWII, Europeans and Japanese as well as Americans were subject to many black-outs and shortages. Research will examine disruptions and popular responses, from the coal shortages at the end of WWI to the winter of 1962-3 which brought the English grid to its knees. Particular attention will be on consumers' and women's groups, and attempts to manage demand, &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; and expectations.

3) Connections/Disconnections: Networks transformed space as well as time. This project is interested in the uneven social and cultural consequences of grids and their variable effect on energy use. Rather than treating grids purely as engineering solutions, we ask how they were imagined, accepted or resisted by communities that suddenly found themselves connected to other regions.

4) Transitions in Everyday Life: What precisely are the dynamics of change that lurk behind the trillions of KWhs that we in the developed world have come to treat as normal? This strand lifts the lid on &amp;quot;demand&amp;quot; and follows the diverse worlds of energy practices in daily life. The transition from wood and coal to coke, natural gas, electricity and oil varied immensely by country, region, class, and building type. We examine people's values and practices as well as how new fuels were marketed. We look at how energy was gendered, made visible, priced and communicated, and at earlier efforts to modify behaviour and promote new technologies, with case studies in London, Saijo City (Japan), Frankfurt, and Burton-on-Trent.

The project collaborates with partners in the cultural sector, government and energy sector as well as international institutes. It seeks to raise public awareness about the role of consumers in energy transitions as well as feed back the lessons of the past for stakeholders tackling the challenge of energy security and climate change today and tomorrow</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims at three main audiences: international stakeholders, domestic/UK policy, and the larger public. Its activities and partnerships are designed to foster knowledge exchange with these groups and to maximise the impact of the research. Key partners are represented on the advisory group to provide on-going support and help the project exploit further impact opportunities as they arise.

The project has secured support from several international organisations and institutes. These include the World Energy Council (WEC), the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS), and Saijo City in Japan. With its large international membership, the WEC will provide an on-going platform for the historical project to exchange knowledge with stakeholders confronting the challenge of energy transitions today. The WEC has invited the PI to participate in its triennial World Energy Congress and facilitate meetings with its members. With the IASS the project will organise a series of workshops and exchange visits to facilitate dialogue with non-historical experts. With Saijo City, the project will collaborate in examining the dynamics of micro-transitions within the city, providing historical expertise and insight for on-going initiatives in sustainability in that city.

Within the UK, the project has collaborative arrangements with Defra which will act as its main partner to facilitate knowledge exchange and impact within the policy community in Whitehall. Defra will jointly host two meetings with the project which are explicitly designed to facilitate exchange of knowledge and feed back insights from this project into policy-making. One workshop will examine how futures have been imagined in scenario planning, past and present, and to give advice on alternative forms of anticipating unpredictable futures. A second meeting will examine changing experiments with measuring and communicating energy. DECC is also aware of the project. The partnership with Defra is understood to reach out to neighbouring departments of state with an interest in energy, and equally with other affiliated bodies and stakeholders, such as the Energy Saving Trust, Energy UK and Renewables UK.

A second group of partner organisations in the UK and internationally is the museum and cultural sector. In the UK, the main partners are the Science Museum Group with the Science Museum and MOSI in Manchester. The project will contribute historical understanding of energy's materiality and, in exchange, benefit from the collections and curatorial knowledge housed in the museum sector. The genre of energy films promises a further opportunity for a transnational exchange of knowledge. In addition to partnership with the BFI, the project has secured arrangements with foreign museums and archives in Germany and Japan to assist with the international comparison of visual genres, bringing together expertise from the film, archival and museum communities.

The Science Museum will serve as the base for one of the events that it is aimed at the public more widely, making use of the visual as well as empirical findings by the project. In addition, the project has secured support from the Raphael Samuel History Centre for a joint public event at the British Library and with support of the History &amp;amp; Policy think-tank. The project has further plans for public communication, including a virtual exhibition, a public debate and more conventional print and news media. The project inquires into the changing ways in which energy has been communicated and represented. It is therefore fitting - at the end of the project - to also reach out to younger members of the public and give them an opportunity to engage with the project and showcase their creative ideas, with the help of a set of workshops and music and drawing competitions. These will be organised with the help of a high school in Saijo City and Guildhall School of Music, London.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>766567</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Harvard University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Harvard</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2216A13-AB0D-414B-A3C7-6F8590BBE732</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has allowed us to establish a multi-disciplinary international network of scholars working on energy-related issues.

This informed the museum's understanding of the topic of energy, which can be used in future exhibitions. The project's PI and CI gave a paper at the 'Science Museum Research Centre and Library Inaugural Conference' at the Science Museum on 31 March 2016. The project organised, with the museum, a workshop on the material practice of energy consumption in September 2016 (see separate entry on the workshop). As the result of the workshop, Trentmann has been invited to act as a guest editor for the special issue of the museum's academic journal, to be published in early 2018.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>California Institute of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Caltech</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A9F902B-145B-46EB-A0B2-44D45020773C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference successfully brought together scholars from environmental science, engineering, geography, development studies, economics, sociology and history.

Also, copies of the booklet were distributed at the WEC Congress to delegates from various countries including France, Italy, Germany, Canada and South Korea. Regarding the booklet, a WEC administrator commented 'it really has been a most successful venture'. The Secretary General of WEC wrote to us: 'I have already used some &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; at the Washington meeting', where he quoted from the book. In January 2016, we received an enquiry from Dr Otilla Marin, Director General Synthesis and Cooperation of Romanian Energy Regulatory Authority concerning the history of WEC. In the email Dr Marin wrote: 'It is very useful, important, to know the history'.

With the cooperation of the regional Education Board, we solicited entries from local primary, secondary and high schools and, as the result, we received total 491 entries to the competition. Some entries came from individuals but most of the entries came from schools, where drawing competition was picked up as an extracurricular session. We selected five first prizes, six second prizes and twenty third prizes according to the selection guidelines we drew up. All entries, along with prize winners' drawings were exhibited at the Saijo Culture Centre on 19 November 2016, when we presented the prizes to prize winners in a public event. The prize winners' drawings were also shown on slideshow during the public event. The competition helped us stimulate interest in energy problems among schoolchildren in the city. Through participating in the competition, competition participants were encouraged to think more about their use of energy than they normally do. Some participants incorporated a message to cherish the earth through careful use of its resources. Some depicted future energy life with technological development, while others focused on negative aspects of what the future will hold. A number of participants reported that, by participating in the competition, they came to think more carefully about the issue of energy, which they took for granted. The prize winners' drawings will be featured on the project's website, for a wider public and international audience. This type of energy art event, especially the one involving young children is unique, and our event can become a model for future similar events. Saijo City Office and the city's educational board expressed their appreciation that such an event was held in the city. The event's impact will be a long-term, due to the publicity work during the competition (thanks to the cooperation of the City Office and local media) and the 'participation prize', solar LED torches, distributed to all participants, which will remind them of their taking part in the drawing competition and how hard they thought about the theme of energy future and society.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a07fa86a5840.97156813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbk.ac.uk/mce/activities/mce-energy-drawing-competition/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2015-09 Second Advisory Committee Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>46DA1ED7-F513-45E8-80D5-A2434F6165E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the second advisory committee meeting held on 15 September 2015.

A lecture by Shin on UK energy history illustrated links between industrialisation and current environmental concerns around energy use. It was followed by the pupils' exploration of the museum, in which the students were asked to think about differences in energy development in the UK and Japan. These activities clearly stimulated pupils interest, apparent in the post-meeting reports submitted by pupils. The event was featured in the project website (http://www.bbk.ac.uk/mce/activities/exploring-ene rgy-in-museum/). A month later, in Saijo City, Japan, the pupils attended a public event (around 100 audience attended the event) in which they reported their activity in the museum event. Here, students also presented on how their views on energy had been changed by the event. They talked about how they took for granted the benefits of energy before attending the event and how, through comparing energy usage in Japan and the UK, they could now depart from what they previously thought was 'normal' and think more proactively about improving everyday energy use. This event was attended by the deputy mayor of Saijo, the students' families and the local public. On the occasion of the post-event meeting (in which Shin appeared via Skype and gave a talk) one of the high school's teacher wrote: 'The study trip members appreciated your comments and it was the first time for the parents and local dignitaries to hear your explanation about energy consumption and our session with you at the Science Museum. They were very much impressed, I am hoping that they will continue to realise that this study trip can offer an important aspect to the pupils' high school education.'

We are currently discussing the project teams' contribution to a historical text on WEC's past activity, including an analysis of the organisation's past forecasting of world's energy resources. We also met with selected members of WEC's national committees, including the Romanian national committee, and project members advised on re-discovering national historical memory and how to use history to support current activities. These meetings have led to WEC's greater appreciation of historical research in this future-oriented organisation.

As the mediator, Shin led the discussion for students to think more carefully and broadly about the topic. On this occasion, we also invited the Kyocera company (a major manufacturer of residential rooftop PV panels) to contribute to the educational programme, with two instructors attending (including one from the company's headquarters). The event therefore provided an opportunity for the high school to connect with a major corporation for collaborative education, while the event directly affected students thinking. Afterwards, students reported a change in their views. One student wrote: 'In the discussion, I learnt how to think about the energy problem using different scales. I thought that approaching the problem using both the small scale of households to the big scale of society would lead to a better understanding of energy consumption, which would help us find better use of energy.' The event encouraged students to engage in the energy problem not as a distant matter but as something close to their everyday life.

Taylor's work in the fields of water and energy enabled her to explore ways in which developments in energy networks changed understandings of water, calls for a national 'water grid' since the 1930s. Her contribution also highlighted the importance of consumer agency and of differentiated household members in the evolution of energy generation and supply systems.

It demonstrated that, despite the increased influence of environmental ideas, the international situation regarding the divide between developed and developing countries has little changed - shown by the fact that developed and developing countries had different priorities over the energy issue already in the 1960s. The blog entry was publicised on Twitter. A reader of the essay, in Japan, wrote that the essay admirably employed historical cases to highlight contemporary problem, especially when the discussion on energy in the Far East - for its preoccupation with future development - tends to neglect historical aspects of the problem. The essay therefore helped to expand the scope of the discussion of energy and COP21.

The event was attended by 139 people excluding speakers and those from the City Office. The participants' age groups were diverse, as the event was held in conjunction with the presentation of the Drawing Competition prizes (see the separate entry for the competition), which meant that some of the participants to the competition (primary, secondary and high school students) and their parents attended the event. Also, among the audience were those from local energy-related businesses. For example, Kyocera's (Japan's largest solar panel seller) local office representatives attended the event. The event was featured in a regional newspaper and some online news websites. One participant noted that the event 'helped us think about the culture of energy'. The energy section of the City Office acknowledged that the event offered a great opportunity for the section members' training - the presentation given by one of the members, prepared by the section as a whole, helped them to put the City's energy-related activity in a broader context. The event formed a part of the city's revision of its energy policy and, on 13 January 2017, the city made public its 'renewable city building programme', for which our partnership had some influence.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a08968ad1328.13290214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ehime-np.co.jp/article/news201612027013</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Trentmann meeting with Nicola Labanca, European Commission, Energy Efficiency expert</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B38BACA-974B-4B0F-AFF2-FA349521E727</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Trentmann exchanged knowledge with energy efficiency expert.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a9dd7a413e57.34047910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Futures Past: Experts, Development and Sustainability&quot;, 27-29 April 2016, Institute of Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS), Potsdam, Germany (co-organiser).</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E53F2C3F-DFC7-48D2-AA15-CD07A8DAD12E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event led to a series of blogs with the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and the International Council for SWcience (ICSU) on lessons from research on expertise in the past for the present.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a9d7b5cf03a7.37818402</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to Ministry of New and Renewable Energy , Delhi</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4CFDD80-FA21-47A0-AF85-56C8B4F3C726</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Knowledge exchange with Government Adviser/ Scientist, Dr. B.S.

Robert Bud, Stuart Butler, Helen Peavitt (Science Museum), Alice Cliff (Manchester Museum of Science and Industry), Lynda Nead (Birkbeck), Sabine Oetzel (Director, Museum Strom und Leben), Elizabeth Shove (Lancaster), Harold Wilhite (University of Oslo), Don Slater (LSE) and Jo Entwistle (King's College), Paul Coleman (University of Leeds), Catherine Grandcl&amp;eacute;ment (EDF), Ruth Garde (Wellcome Collection), along with three members from the MCE project (Trentmann, Shin, Wright). Also, two observers from the Science Museum were present. The workshop consisted of presentations and lively discussions, and the event established a mutual understanding between the museum curators and energy-scholars. The success of the workshop can be understood from the fact that the Science Museum has agreed to publish a special issue of its journal based on the workshop papers, and Trentmann has been nominated as a guest editor of the special issue.

After the event, students sent us feedback, which demonstrated the strong impression left by our message of using social and cultural pathways to create sustainable energy future. One student wrote: &amp;quot;I realised that we are currently facing many difficult problems regarding technology and resources. I was also forced to consider just what I can do personally.&amp;quot; The school principal wrote: &amp;quot;The event provided a valuable experience that is not a part of the normal studies for these pupils.&amp;quot; A regional newspaper (circulation approximately 260,000) reported on the event: &amp;quot;An event attendant, second-year student commented that, through the event, he became aware of the complexity of the energy problem.&amp;quot; As a result, between 2015 and 2016, the high school organised a series of extra-curricular seminar series on sustainable energy, in which students learned about the global energy situation, the role of renewable energy and changing conditions of the energy market.

These include:

1) Some of the findings have been presented in the 2015 Carlowitz lecture to the German government Council of Sustainability (Rat f&amp;uuml;r nachhaltige Entwicklung) and their members and interested stakeholders at their annual convention in 2015, and subsequently in the short book published in 2016 and distributed by RNE amongst experts and stakeholders in the field of sustainability and energy, as well as being available for interested members of the public.

2) The project has examined the historical evolution of energy debates for the oldest international energy organisation, the World Energy Council, in a booklet on WEC's history.

3) The project's case study on the history of Japan's renewable energy has assisted Saijo City Office - the city was the place where Japan's largest solar PV experiment was conducted between 1981 and 1992 - to re-discover its legacy of renewable energy development. It had impact within the city office and among the local community: our project received a mention in the municipal parliament and one of our study events was reported in a regional newspaper (circulation approx. 260,000). The project's findings have also been used in the three study events for Saijo High Schools in Japan and in the UK. These events were organised around the project's research themes which were used not only in lectures but also as the case studies and discussion topics for students to think deeply about current energy problems and the future challenges of creating a sustainable society. 

Our project has engaged in a wide variety of activities, through which we interacted with diverse groups of policy makers, business corporations, cultural institutions, researchers, the younger generation and the general public. 

The workshop we jointly organised with the University of West England and Lancaster University 'Scales of Disruption' was attended by stakeholders from DECC, Defra, Transport for London and Climate Southeast. We tackled the question of how to translate historical research on various types of disruptions into practical knowledge that can be utilised in the policy context. Outside the UK, the PI has given an invited lecture on the current and future problem of sustainability for the German government's Rat f&amp;uuml;r nachhaltige Entwicklung (Council for Sustainable Development) and published it as a booklet. The lecture was attended by policy makers, energy practitioners and academics, and it will be published as a booklet, which will further broaden the project's reception. 

The workshop the project co-organised with Hitotsubashi University, Tokyo, Japan, brought together participants from wide ranging fields. Not only academics, such as economists, historians, geographers, scientists and engineers, but also policymakers (Japan METI, US Presidential Deputy Envoy and former Deputy Assistant US Secretary of State for Energy) and a business CEO participated in the workshop's discussion. Through the exchange of opinions, views and findings, the workshop contributed to deepen the public and expert discussion about energy problems in Japan and beyond.

Having EDF as one of our partners has been important. Members of EDF participated in the 'Scales of Disruption' workshop and the two advisory committee meetings, allowing us to exchange insights into the patterns of energy consumers' behaviour - and also learn about research within EDF itself. In Sep 2016 members of the project team hosted a workshop at EDF Innovation Centre in Paris, exploring the construction of energy futures. This was attended by approx.. 20 members of the EDF Research &amp;amp; Development on Energy Demand and Dynamics of Consumption group. 

Our project is starting to have impact in the community of international energy experts, chiefly through the medium of the World Energy Council (WEC). The booklet we produced for WEC was distributed to a number of WEC's national committees and it is also available online. We have already received comments and enquiries from those working in the energy sector in and outside the UK. The most notable contribution of our work with WEC is that some energy experts, including WEC's secretariat staff, reported they have come to recognise the importance of past experience for thinking about current energy problems. To strengthen this collaboration further, we are planning to give a talk at WEC's Executive Assembly in Lisbon in October 2017. 

In Japan, we have organised a series of events with Saijo City (one of our partners) to engage with a municipal authority in order to put our research to practical use. Our project's case studies are providing a basis for Saijo City's revision of its official energy and environmental strategy for the future. The project also organised three study events for Saijo High School ('Thinking about Energy' event; 'Sustainable Society'; How can we change our Energy use?'). These events raised awareness of sustainable energy consumption among the younger generation. The success of these events led the high school to organise a special lecture series on renewable energy as an extra-curricular module. In 2016, the project organised a further study event with Saijo High School, an art competition with the city's primary, secondary and high schools and a public event involving the city office, local businesses, the general public and local schoolchildren. The art competition had a great response from local schools and had a significant number of entries. The public event was well attended - the audience number was approximately 150 people in total - and the event was reported on the local news media. One tangible result was that Shin has been invited to become an academic advisor to Saijo city, to constantly feed in to the city's long-term policy making and development planning.

 The project has also been working with public museums. The Science Museum Group has supported two past study events for Saijo High School. In 2015 and 2016, the group provided venues for three study events at the Science Museum, London, and the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. The partnership with the Science Museum enabled us to connect with the community of museum curators, and this connection bore fruit in the Sept 2016 workshop on the material culture of energy that brought together historians and museum curators to discuss ways of improving the quality of energy-related exhibitions in museums through a dialogue between academic researchers and curators. The project's other partner the Museum Strom und Leben participated in this workshop. The partnership with museums has broadened the project's scope. For example, the PI served as a consultant on the exhibition 'Body Electric' opened in February 2017 at the Wellcome Institute, while another member of the project gave a talk at the Science Museum's 'Lates: Let There Be Light' event. The PI and CI of the project also presented a paper on the project's research outcomes at the museum's Research Centre and Library Inaugural Conference in March 2016, an event involving not only academics but also the museum's stakeholders. The project has had interactions with other museums and archives such as the Science and Technology Museum in Canada and the Kerosene Case Archives in Japan, exchanging insights with curators and archivists while contributing to these institutions' publications. 

The project has invested substantial amount of effort to connect with the general public through digital media. In addition to setting up a dedicated project website in June 2015, the project members have contributed to a number of blog essays ranging from blogs for the UK Energy Research Centre to the Sustainable Consumption Institute (Manchester University). The PI's appearance in a programme for BBC Forum reached over a million listeners. Already, some new contacts have been established with those who became aware of the project's work through the radio broadcast.

 In the final year, the project has in line a number of exciting plans for creating impact. In addition to the project's final event, the following events are scheduled: a conference on energy transition in Cambridge; a two-day workshop on energy landscape with Rachel Carson Center in April 2017; presenting at the World Energy Council; a public event on energy films with BFI; and a music workshop.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7C804553-41E9-4DBA-A938-6DF69E2E063E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5444ec90e31394.25964738</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Material Cultures of Energy&amp;quot; is a historical research project that examines how energy has transformed daily life in the twentieth century. The project investigates how energy transitions played themselves out in people's lives in the past; how networks and grids changed space and communities; how energy futures were imagined and contested; and how societies lived with shortages and disruption. To investigate these themes, we draw on comparative historical research, including Britain, North America, Germany and Japan.

Our main findings so far (Mar 2017) on these topics include:

1) Networks and energy demand have not expanded along the same pattern. In addition to technological diversity, our research has highlighted the importance of local governance and regionally distinct energy cultures. This has had a significant impact on the speed and extent to which homes were electrified, and thus on energy consumption. While all rural areas were a challenge for energy providers faced with difficult terrain and low population densities, regionally specific governance arrangements and ideologies helped to create uneven rates of network development, distinct fuel mixes and differing perceptions of consumers in different areas. In rural South Wales in the 1950s the slow development of electricity networks was repeatedly attributed by providers and policy makers to rural residents' low consumption rates, over 40% of farmers spending &amp;pound;10 or less on electricity per year in the early 50s. By contrast, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board's founding 'social clause' (1943), obliging it to 'have regard to the social and economic betterment of sparsely populated areas', encouraged a supplier-driven roll out of electrical connections to remote dwellings and relatively rapid creation of demand, achieved through highly diverse networks and systems of provision: from hydro-electric power, steam- and diesel-fired power stations - even in the 1950s experimental peat and wind stations - alongside the provision of Calor Gas to remote islands. By 1963, 50% of the Board's consumers were using electric cookers: the highest percentage in Britain at that time. In Ontario, Canada, the extension of hydro-power networks to all the provinces' consumers was envisaged as a replacement fuel for gas and coal at the turn of the twentieth century, but post-45 parliamentary debates show that urban and rural users continued to experience variable levels of electrical service and still relied on alternative fuels. Gas ranges for cooking were still more prevalent at the beginning of the 1950s in Ontario and many urban consumers still relied on coal for heating.

Counter to the story of modernisation which only sees the progress of networks, we have also highlighted the importance of non-networked arrangements and the survival of highly diverse consumption patterns within the same class and community. The role of collective providers such as council housing and municipal authorities in what we have termed &amp;quot;consumption by proxy&amp;quot; has received sustained attention. There are also implications here for social and energy inequality. Research has uncovered the considerable number of urban households who remained excluded from electricity in Britain in the mid-twentieth century.

2) Research has revealed the changing role assigned to households, end-users and aggregate demand within energy forecasts over the twentieth century. Today's statistical models are just one chapter in a longer story in which competing experts, methods and voices have had their say. In particular, we have followed the increasingly marginal place given to domestic consumers and women movement's in national and international energy forecasts and energy commissions as these shifted to models of planning or markets after the Second World War.

3) Energy shortages have been mostly associated with the oil crises of the 1970s, but our project has shown that uncertainty and disruption continued after the Second World War for considerably longer than has been conventionally recognised. Research has revealed the important temporal politics of energy shortages in daily life as well as economic policy. Regimes responded to shortages in different ways after the Second World War. Japan, for example, prioritised big industrial users while the UK protected household energy supply at all cost. After the 1953 uprising, socialist GDR tended to impose additional nightshifts and rationing on industries and chose not to intervene directly in domestic life. These differences reflected different ideological and political realities as well as cultures of time. Research has also pointed to the different degrees of resilience and the variable impact of disruptions. In Canada, the ice storm of 1998 produced the longest period of hydro downtime in recorded history (up to 4 weeks) and affected more than 4.7 million people. Differences in experiences of the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec suggest that historical approaches to HEP connection and network investment heavily influenced responses. In Qu&amp;eacute;bec criticism was directed towards the heavy historical investments in HEP that had created an over-dependency on electricity, while those living in eastern Ontario, just across the border were better serviced by back-up options when the power failed. 

 
4) Research has revealed the role of consumers in fuel transitions in daily life. 
In 1930s Bedfordshire, for example, rural electricity consumers who had only recently been connected to electricity supply successfully boycotted a tariff increase by the network. Energy networks created rural residents for the first time as problem consumers: more expensive to reach and with distinct consumption practices that made them doubly unprofitable. By the 1960s the majority of rural consumers in Britain were connected to electricity, though usage remained highly uneven across the grid. The history of rural transition shows how the varied habits and practices of energy users became linked to a discourse of the universal needs, entitlements and duties of energy users. 

In general, the project's research findings about the active role of consumers challenges the established view of energy as supply in search of demand. At the time of writing, the project has begun to explore further consumer responses to efforts to increase the use of high energy consuming appliances, such as electric cookers, to fuel saving efforts in the 1940s and 50s, and to off-peak tariffs by which from the 1960s onwards suppliers sought to change the timing of key consumption practices, such as space heating and clothes washing. Decisions taken in the past about the provision of gas or electricity to housing estates for heating and cooking continue to shape spatial divisions between consumers and to sustain distinct perceptions of resilience and vulnerability. Residents in a North London Peabody Estate served by gas since its construction in the 1980s are today, in 2016, taking the landlords to court to resist a changeover from gas, preferring a temporary disruption of gas supplies while a fault is investigated - and hot meals provided by the Red Cross - to the forced adoption of electric cookers and heating which they consider unaffordable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The individual entries in research fish give a snapshot of our main activities and how these have already led to engagement and use by other stakeholders as well as academics. 

In addition, and since the question is about the contingent future (&amp;quot;might&amp;quot;), we should like to highlight the following opportunities: 

1) Collaboration with the World Energy Council has already increased awareness among WEC members of their own history. This might be extended to the specific trajectory of forecasting practices and a review of its main changes over time. The project team is planning to present core findings at the WEC Executive Assembly meeting in Lisbon in October 2017, and to capitalise on its existing connection to reach stakeholders assembling at this meeting.

2) We are working with several of our co-partners in government and the museum/arts sector to exchange findings and contribute research, including:
+a workshop on the material cultures of energy, with curators and representatives of the museum sector, including the Science Museum (London) and representatives from Deutsche Museum (Munich) and others (Sept 2016)

 +an activity with Defra to discuss research arising from the work on changing energy futures

+a workshop on the visual representations of energy, with the British Film Institute (2017)

3) We are planning to explore how we can feed back more about the active role of consumers and lessons from the past for current policy debate. Our research on energy disruption, for example, could increase the awareness of the broad impact of energy disruption on energy users' everyday life (e.g. its effect on daily routines, emergency preparation at home, and the users' choice of energy sources) among our partners in the fields of policy making and energy business (DECC, Defra and EDF in particular). This type of knowledge can assist better management of energy shortages while avoiding serious damages to the welfare and health of energy users.

4) Through the PI's involvement in the DEMAND research network (one of the EPSRC/ESRC energy research centres), we have contributed historical insight to our understanding of what makes energy demand. This has already included a lunch-time presentation and discussion at DECC (2015). In addition to the journal articles and papers listed in research fish, we are completing an interdisciplinary volume which will ensure that historical research reaches neighbouring disciplines.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4BACD09A-8E94-43C6-A511-4929BD2DA51A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5444ed09167cf1.17199211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbk.ac.uk/mce/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Saijo, Japan, energy past, present and future</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7661036E-66E2-4A10-9359-B6806A0DA927</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project's case study on the history of Japan's renewable energy has assisted Saijo City Office - the city was the place where Japan's largest solar PV experiment was conducted between 1981 and 1992 - to re-discover its legacy of renewable energy development.

Furthermore, for Saijo City, the project organised an art competition and a public event in 2016. The art competition raised awareness of energy and environmental issues among the city's schoolchildren, while the public event contributed to consolidate the city's energy policy. A visible impact was the city's 'renewable building programme' (Jan 2017) that was directly and indirectly informed by the collaboration between the city and the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99b9c41a5e6.44308881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.city.saijo.ehime.jp/site/gikai/280302.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>2015-06 Carl-von-Carlowitz lecture 'Material Culture and Consumers' in Berlin, , Rat f&amp;uuml;r nachhaltige Entwicklung (Ger government), annual congress</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67A199D1-EBE1-409B-BF10-09B09EDF1478</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In presenting project findings to policy makers , energy practitioners and academics, the lecture sent the message that past experience should inform discussions about current and future problems of sustainability. Trentmann was invited by the Council to produce an extended version for publication. This publication (Materielle Kultur und Energiekonsum, oekom publishers, Munich 2016) has been circulated to stakeholders with an interest in sustainable development (government ministries, business, sustainability research centres). The Council (RNE) writes (20 Feb 2017): &amp;quot;the statistics for our website (checked 20 Feb 2017) show: after publishing the free PDF of the booklet in November 2016, we mentioned it in our newsletter which goes out to 11,000 readers. Since then, the file/booklet was accessed 13,161 times, a very high number reflecting great interest in the research. From the perspective of the Rat Fuer Nachhaltige Entwicklung (German Council for Sustainable Development), the impact of both Trentmann's lecture and his booklet is that it allows us to bring forward the sustainability debate in a science-politics-interface. Science based policy-making is crucial in order to strengthen sustainable development, and a closer look at the impacts of past decision-making and political programmes as outlined in Trentmann's lecture and booklet sheds light on nexuses that are often overseen in the daily business of politics and any measures to promote sustainable development. As concerns our work at RNE, we make use of any possibility to promote the booklet and to relate the research underpinning it to current debates about sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99ad6e55860.10435608</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national
