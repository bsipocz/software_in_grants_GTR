They will be able to book while at home, at the shops, or in the bank without waiting. When they

arrive and check-in they will be greeted by name.

Barclays' Book-it is a new appointment booking service by Rewarding Visits, for existing customers

and new enquirers. Book-it will enable anyone to make appointment bookings and check-in for their

meetings. It will be available online using a mobile device, from a home computer or at an interactive

kiosk called a Touchpoint.

Rewarding Visits will develop a Barclays Touchpoint. It includes a digital display, touch pad screen,

card scanner and thermal printer. It will display real-time adviser availability and promote financial

offers, as well as linking to Book-it.

Touchpoint users will receive a handy printed reminder slip and be able to choose an optional

notification. Online bookers get a notification message of their choice.

On the day of the meeting, by entering their details at the Touchpoint, they will check in for the

meeting. This alerts the adviser who can now welcome them by name. By linking to the Rewarding Visits network, Touchpoints can also be sited elsewhere in the community, extending the reach outside the bank's doors. If the project takes place at Barclay's in Mansfield or Sutton Coldfield, Barclays Book-it will also be available at six other Touchpoints elsewhere in the town: including the Shopping Centre, the College and the Cinema. Running in conjunction with the local loyalty scheme promoted by each town's Business Improvement District, Touchpoints are being installed in high footfall locations to boost local businesses. Each will make the most of the 4,000 plus members already in each town using town centre cards and the Rewarding Visits app. The Touchpoint at Barclays will recognise the holders of town cards and users of the Rewarding Visits app, making their appointment booking and checking-in experience much quicker. An iBeacon installed inside the Barclays Touchpoint will detect when a Rewarding Visits app user is in the building for a meeting, automatically checking them in, and alerting the adviser to meet them. By trialing the use of contactless cards and apps at the Touchpoint during the project, it will pave the way for development of payment card and app recognition for seamless branch use. Through working alongside other businesses in the town for the project, it will chart the potential for using a Touchpoint at Barclays as a community hub for stimulating visits for local businesses in other towns.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>42000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">230033</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
