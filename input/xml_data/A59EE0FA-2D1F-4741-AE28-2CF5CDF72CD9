Traditionally, for instance, a poet might write a libretto to instructions from a musician; and then take no further creative part in the work. This research investigates an aspect of what happens when the collaboration persists throughout the making of the work; and where one aspect of the work (e.g. a libretto) is subordinated to the overall musical piece.\nSuch changes in practice arise not just from social changes and new thought in modernist and postmodernist aesthetics, but from the possibilities afforded by developments in new media tools in use by artists.\nMany of these tools may be used in ways for which traditional notational systems are inappropriate. And the same applies to methods of working, especially when a poet works on equal terms with painters and musicians in areas that are not, traditionally, the poet's.\nNotations have been developed to deal with this on an ad hoc basis; but this research proposes to investigate and draw conclusions from a representative selection of such ad hoc notations.\nFor instance, do they actually work objectively for any artist who uses them? What limitations do they have? How may they be improved? How might they be standardized for the benefit of those who do not wish to develop their own system? In short, is it possible to establish a good practice in this area. \nThe Researcher will be the poet and sound artist and graphic artist, Lawrence Upton, who will build on his previous research into the notation of sound and visual poetry; the extension of the poem into dance; and the writing of collaborative performance pieces which cut across traditional artistic category boundaries\nThe research will be based in the Music Department of Goldsmith's college where there is already considerable interest and expertise in many of the areas concerned.\nIt is intended that, by the time the project has been completed in three years time, there will have been produced a number of new multi- &amp;amp; cross-media works, especially collaborative, their performance open to the public; a number of conference and seminar presentations &amp;amp; papers in academic journals; a published collection or collections of interviews with practitioners; online documentation and texts; and a CD with booklet of selected works.\nThe research will be conducted by observation and study of existing new works; by interview of a range of practitioners; and by testing conclusions and theories in practice by applying them to the composition and notation of new collaborative works.\nApart from Upton himself, a number of members of the Music Dept will be closely involved in aspects of the work; and Upton will be looking for collaborators in all aspects of his research in the college as a whole: this may include, Computing, Drama, Media and Communication, Visual Arts and Goldsmiths Digital Studios.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>live text sound composition</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD018B38-84F7-46FD-BFC7-D0A4F955F42E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The raw text of NAMING for Ricki Redhead has been web-published by Poetics Canada 8.

The following notes were made after the event and wedre made available to you in 2011

Post STILL
Not what I intended? expected? quieter, less showy, less physically gestural. [The possibility that I would do was based in what I had done before: see my essay Sound-singing Carlo Carr&amp;agrave; [with editor] 
At no point did I stand up to perform. I sat in the same seat in the third row that I had occupied throughout the film show. I used a radio mike.
I felt but did not really know or try to find out that the sound engineer would turn down the volume if I went &amp;quot;too loud&amp;quot;
So I performed to a film made by another with sound controlled by another - some distance from my usual practice
I had seen the film before but hadn't then paid so much attention to it and had long since forgotten it. Having heard William English speak of it during the day, I was perhaps more sympathetic too it than I had been - and that possible lack of sympathy had been my mistake
Knowing from William that it could be said to fall into two halves was useful; but when the second half started it was hard for me to believe because it seemed to come too soon; and it was just as surprising when the end came
There was the anticipated problem which might be summed up: my m.o. derives from treating inscription as linguistic whereas the film shows us &amp;quot;inscription&amp;quot; as pictorial. It can be a problem with vispo made for the purpose by others but accepted by me as &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; - though I can't now think of any examples but I have found, I know, that oddities occur - it may be in performances by jgjgjg (as long as you can say it that's our name), many years back - there are severe perturbations where two modes of reading collide, inscription reading trying to continue into a period of simultaneous pictoriality
Some of what I did today was, to some extent at least, by way of sound effects - some element of groans of effort as the man on the bed turned; groans of pleasure as he &amp;quot;sun&amp;quot;-bathed and relaxed on his bed
But it was also commenting as opposition i.e. vs. the fact that my soundtrack was NOT a sound track but a kind of narration
maybe
Other sounds were less attributable and more what Bob Grumman may mean by &amp;quot;juxtaphor&amp;quot;
Much that I did was not new; but I used frequently resorted to methods - materials, I might say - in ways that was new; and there was more space - silence - between my utterances than usual
What I think was new was my use of my 1.5 litre spring water bottle and its label. I drummed it, tapped it, nail-scraped it. It was shaken. It was turned upside down, rapidly inverting it and its partly-absent contents to produce interesting sounds. The label was fretted and dragged at and generally interfered with and torn - a drawn out tearing because it was so heavily stuck to the bottle with adhesive.
There was also the use of my t-shirt which, normally, would have been unavailable, a bit of loose cloth (I wear the largest I can get, XXXL, much too big for me, for comfort); but with a radio mike attached to it by a small built on bulldog clip. The adjacent fabric could be stretched drum tight and then released ortweaked and fretted, producing different drumlike effects.
There were sounds of which I was anxious to include, without means, in the perceived sound - a dragging susurration of a sound as a door was opened and closed; some crashes that were occurring right outside the auditorium, or so it seemed. &amp;quot;Don't ignore that as a distraction,&amp;quot; I thought; &amp;quot;regard it as part of the film&amp;quot;
I think that at some point someone joined in. I have known that before. It seems to be a satirical response, usually by those who have not grasped what I am trying to do. An assumption is made by them that there is some misbehaviour going on. 
We lost a few of the audience. There is a colloquial analytical method which reads it as a good sign if people get up and leave during a performance; though it may just indicate that those people have got to the end of the time they can spare from other responsibilities or interests; and with such a varied programme as was presented it was impossible to say what they were responding to in leaving the auditorium
The applause at the end of the performance was warm and enthusiastic; and redoubled when William English thanked me. Many had not realised that I was performing live and in the audience - the programme notes were given out after I had performed. Later, outside the auditorium, as everyone was leaving, a number of people went out of their way to thank me - probably a more telling datum than the results on an audience response form. The numbers involved were really too small to be a statistical basis for an argument; yet they went out of their way to thank me when there was no pressure to do so - it can be reduced to two composite comments (i) good sound (ii) such a surprise - the surprise of having someone provide a live &amp;quot;sound track&amp;quot; apparently counted for as much pleasue as the pleasure I gave them with my sound track itself
So, despite all that I said to William English, there was no stress. I obviated that to a great extent by never announcing or overtly demonstrating what I was doing - though that rlief was not my motivation.
The pressure to do a good job and to give William what he wanted - or something else that he was grateful to have! - was still there; but a more public banana skin was inadvertently avoided or averted
Yet it was really a judgement that it was aesthetically best for me to stay in my seats which kept me there.
Had I stood up there it would been a visual interaction with the film which was hardly called for. I had responded anticipatorily to a(n unrecorded) description by William English of his film by saying that I could treat it as dance and thereby pick up on earlier work with dancers (most recently at Laban in 2008)
From that perspective, I might conclude that I should do something dancelike - though I have a broad interpretation of what that might be
When the film was actually running, I found myself quite happy to let the film dance , and sit there responding only in the sonic
Nor do I want to do anything too strong. One of the things about the film that I see now is its relative understatement. And there's also the oddity of much that we're seeing. I didn't want to dominate that. Better, I felt, to be as restrained as the film.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E87A94E2-D05B-48B6-BD38-B2ECF76C1C29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On me, considerable.

They are adequate for me to speak with my collaborators who are used to to open-ended and indecisive aesthetic statements!
The need to state the matter simply and clearly is still very much on my mind. 
I could I suppose draw conclusions from the papers I have published; but I would also wish to refer to works and studies in process, including a range of three dimensional notations which are as yet too fluid in conception to summarise effectively.
A lot should clear up when I have time to work on that; and when Benedict Taylor has time to work on the series Possibles; and when Professor John Drever has time to attend to our proposed piece Tombolo.
I am anxious to see these works developed and realised.
It may take perhaps two years... I have an invitation to speak in Santiago de Chile which I have delayed not least because I think my hosts at the university and at FDE, the Chilean opposite number of Writers Forum, would welcome news of these matters.
I envisage and hope for a laregish publication currently known as Lab Book. 
It may be frustrating; but I hope that it will be worth it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Others are welcome to follow my performance leads; or indeed the leads in my essays
