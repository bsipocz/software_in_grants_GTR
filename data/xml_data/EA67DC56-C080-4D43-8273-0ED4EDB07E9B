Despite many efforts to find new disease-modifying therapies for this disease, recent clinical trials have failed to show significant benefits and currently patients are only treated with drugs that alleviate disease symptoms. 

Traditionally, drug discovery strategies have focused on neurons as the main targets in Alzheimer's and other brain disorders. In the brain, neurons are responsible for processing information, learning and memory, while other specialized brain cells called glial cells are necessary to maintain neuron health and to aid neuron function. To be able to design effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease, we need to investigate not only how neurons become dysfunctional but also to better understand what is the contribution of glial cells to the degeneration of neurons and the disease progression. The aim of this project is to investigate how astrocytes, the most abundant type of glial cell, can protect neurons in Alzheimer's disease. If we are able to identify which are the factors released from astrocytes that mediate neuroprotection, we will be able to design effective therapeutic tools.

This research program will be carried out at the Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, a newly built highly interdisciplinary neuroscience center at King's College London. We have established complementary collaborations that will enable us to employ a number of models of Alzheimer's disease, including mouse neuron and glia cell cultures, mouse brain slices and human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from patients. Using these models, we will investigate what are the factors released from astrocytes that affect the accumulation of abnormal proteins in brain and we will determine how these factors can protect Alzheimer's disease neurons from dying. Our findings will provide pre-clinical evidence to support follow up therapeutic studies.

This proposal will explore the potential benefits of increasing astrocyte-released factors as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent loss of neuron function in Alzheimer's disease. This is a novel avenue of research, which could have a significant impact on our understanding of neurodegenerative mechanisms and that may identify new ways to treat Alzheimer's disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A major challenge in biomedical research is to design effective therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying AD remains to be elucidated, in part due to a traditional neurocentric view of the disease that has hampered the study of other brain cells such as astrocytes. The objective of this proposal is to shed light into the mechanisms of intercellular signalling between neurons and astrocytes and how these are modulated in disease. I aim to identify endogenous factors that are employed by astrocytes to protect neurons and that could represent the target of novel therapies for AD.

In preliminary data I have shown that astrocytes secrete molecular chaperones, intracellular proteins that prevent protein misfolding and that are protective in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the function of chaperones as extracellular proteins is not understood and is a completely novel notion in the context of astrocyte-neuron communication. I hypothesize that molecular chaperones secreted from astrocytes provide a non-cell autonomous form of protection to neurons in AD. 

We will study the profile of chaperones secreted from astrocytes in AD-like conditions and characterize the impact that these extracellular chaperones have for relevant aspects of AD, such as tau aggregation, synapse and neuronal health. We will also explore their mechanisms of neuroprotection, such as internalization into neurons to provide a novel mechanism to increase neuronal chaperone load. As a proof of concept to validate their therapeutic use, we will use organotypic brain slice cultures from AD transgenic mice to test the protective effects of astrocyte-secreted chaperones in a relevant disease model. 

Understanding how astrocytes and neurons interact and whether chaperones are intermediaries will help identify 1) important molecular mechanisms underlying AD, as well as 2) novel protective factors to exploit as disease-modifying therapie</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project will have an obvious societal and economical impact and I anticipate that three main groups will be the beneficiaries from this program: 

1. Alzheimer's disease patients and society
According to the &amp;quot;World Alzheimer's Report 2015&amp;quot; (Alzheimer's Disease International, www.alz.co.uk), about 46.8 million people worldwide are currently living with dementia. With increases in the aged population, it is expected that this number will double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030, of which about 58% will be living in developing countries. The &amp;quot;Dementia UK: Second Edition&amp;quot; report from Alzheimer's Society (www.alzheimers.org.uk) shows that in the UK there are 850,000 people living with dementia, at an expense of &amp;pound;26 billion a year in care and treatment. This cost is not only suffered by the NHS, but it is estimated that two-thirds of this sum is paid by the patients and their families. Our research will address this societal challenge and, while exploring the basis of the molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease, ultimately I aim to identify potential targets for pharmacologic treatments. As described in &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot;, we will engage with patients and their families at different levels including an active participation in public engagement activities organized by King's College and by Alzheimer's research charities.

2. Pharmaceutical industry
Currently there are no therapies that can cure Alzheimer's disease or any other form of dementia and patients are treated with drugs that aim to alleviate some of the disease symptoms. During my postdoctoral research, I led a project with a strong translational approach and which relied on a collaboration between the University of Cambridge and industry, Siena Biotech, to develop effective small molecules that showed potential for the treatment of Huntington's disease. In this proposal, I have designed a translational project to ensure that findings from our research have a medium and long-term mpact in the discovery of potential new treatments for Alzheimer's disease. This project will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease and will identify endogenous factors that can be protective. In addition, we will explore novel forms of drug delivery, such as the use of exosomes, currently being investigated as a delivery system, which could be particularly useful for brain diseases (Alvarez-Erviti, 2011; Haney, 2015). The use of a pre-clinical model of AD will precede future experiments in animal models and will form the basis of collaborations with pharmaceutical companies with an interest in dementia. Among others, I can envisage collaborations with the Alzheimer's Research UK Drug Discovery Institute in Cambridge, whose academic lead is my postdoctoral research supervisor, David Rubinsztein, or Astrazeneca and Eli Lilly, who are currently collaborating with the host laboratory.

3. Research assistant and students involved in this project
This project will facilitate training to the research associate employed on this award, as well as King's College MSc, BSc and PhD students that regularly undertake research projects in the host department. They will have the opportunity to develop laboratory techniques but importantly, also transferable skills such as data analysis and interpretation, writing or presentation skills. I have experience in day-to-day supervision and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students as well as in organizing career development workshops for students and postdoctoral researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>972226</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N022696/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
