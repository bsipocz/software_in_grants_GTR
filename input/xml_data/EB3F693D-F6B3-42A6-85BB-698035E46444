This project allows these academics to work with a number of selected community groups on focused and strategic networking and development activities with productive research and dissemination outcomes for the groups. Community heritage and archaeology projects are often focused on 'doing', on the processes of archaeology and the collection of data, but often with limited attention paid to the wider interpretation and then dissemination of their results to varied audiences within their communities and beyond. The aim of the research is to understand how the explanatory and interrogatory potential of mobile device technology (software apps) can be used to build community-led analysis and interpretations, presentation and education within community archaeology projects. Mobile apps can be used to present sophisticated visual and textual interpretations to help understand the history of a particular place or the results of an archaeological project; but they can also be used to acquire a range of data on user preferences, activities, interests and identifying real user needs and unexploited affordances in established mobile technologies. This project explores the potential of carefully designed mobile device apps not just to allow but to positively encourage feedback and input from community users in a three part co-production process of;
1) Visualising archaeological material and historical remains in an app.
2) Inviting communities to question, adapt, challenge, add-to or reshape the interpretation through the app.
3) Recording and analyzing those choices to map preferred ideas and ways of community archaeological interpretation.
These can then be used to widely inform further development and strategic improvement in this field with a view to assisting in developing an industry / research community standard for this kind of community-led interpretation and dissemination. The key innovation of this project is to bring together existing community heritage groups (with advanced projects and datasets deserving wider dissemination), with academics interested in the interpretation and dissemination of archaeological and architectural heritage and technological advisors and specialists at the forefront of mobile software development. The project involves dedicated early career researchers and technology specialists working with the selected community partners to produce and then test apps that meet their varied needs, including developing the necessary software, conducting 3D laser scan surveys, 3D digital modeling and visualization, 'proofing' the apps and providing ongoing technical support during the lifetime of the project. Community partners will share their data and feed into the design at every level, and will receive a tailored product suitable to their needs and capable of being used by their key audiences. The reception and use of the apps will be monitored to gather data about their users and assess their functionality. Critical lessons will be learnt and shared about the challenges and opportunities presented by these new technologies for often small scale community heritage organisations. A central part of the project is a programme of networking opportunities in the form of community participation workshops at the University of Nottingham and the University of Durham and also a number of focus groups targeted at evaluating specific aspects of the software and its use. These are intended to facilitate sharing of experiences and ideas between community partners and across the project team.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will create a novel mobile device app which will allow members of community archaeology groups to digitally create their own interpretative explanations of the archaeological artifacts and buildings they are involved with in order to reflect their own points of view about how their archaeology should be understood. It will allow users to become active contributors to archaeological and heritage interpretation and not just passive consumers of it. It will allow contested, divergent and minority interpretations to be heard as well as offer the opportunity for the emergence of completely new insights into communities' understanding of their archaeology. The research will assist in strengthening the nation's public engagement with its heritage and provide a model for similar applications which can be developed to enhance the UK's digital economy and creative output. Beyond the community heritage groups who are partners in this proposal and who will be immediate beneficiaries there will be a large number of other community heritage groups and national organisations like the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI), English Heritage (EH) and the National Trust (NT) throughout the UK who may look to the outcomes of this research to inform their own outreach, interpretation and education activities. In the longer term this research will also contribute to the mainstream commercial tourism, heritage and conservation industry both at an enabling level and an economic one, enhancing the UK's economic performance, and competitiveness. Academic institutions engaged in a wide range of research from architecture and archaeology, to social history and computer science will also benefit from the outcomes in that through the normal process of publication and dissemination they will be able to build upon the results of this research to inform their own work. This may extend to related fields such as the computer games and other digital creative industries that have vested interests in the use of digital technologies for arts and entertainment and whose technologies are now beginning to be used for digital heritage purposes. Other beneficiaries may include local and national government who have interests in promoting heritage in UK towns and cities where they determine and influence heritage policy and where they may utilise the research to increase the effectiveness of public services. It may also be used by local and nationally funded institutional heritage outlets and repositories such as museums and galleries who may wish to employ digital technologies at a range of levels to more fully engage with their visitors and by doing so enhance the quality of life in the UK and its cultural and creative output. In carrying out the research teams from De Montfort University, the University of Nottingham and the University of Durham will continue to develop their existing expertise in co-production with community heritage groups. This expertise will be both technical, in adapting technologies to the needs of specific audiences, users and providers and also managerial in developing the mechanisms to collaborate with a diverse range of constituents with widely different technical abilities, organizational structures, interests and frames of reference. In doing so it will enable the research teams to further develop their usefulness to wider society. The final results of the proposed research will be available for on-line download in January 2015.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32256</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Histric Southwell App Development Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B6AA5C10-AFA1-43B5-8DC7-903B321ABD7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of AHRC funded Connected Communities project (Digital Building Heritage Phase 3 - Grant Ref AHL0132901) on the 30th April Dr. Chris King (Co-Investigator) at the University Of Nottingham Department Of Archaeology hosted a day-long workshop with representatives of the Southwell Community Archaeology Group (SCAG) and De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Group (P.I.

The development of this app was a collaborative co-production project between De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Group, the Department of Archaeology at the University of Nottingham (Co-Investigator Dr Chris King) and the Southwell Community Archaeology Group (SCAG). The objective was to create a new, prototype mobile device app which would allow finds and other information to be uploaded by users to 3D representations of archaeological and historical sites and then explored in an intuitive way. The idea behind this was to give community heritage groups' greater opportunities to interpret their own finds and present them in a way which would allow these groups to shape the stories about the archaeology they were involved with. There are two key new concepts in this prototype app which makes it different from other data-base archaeology apps that are available and which make a significant advance in the functionality and use-ability of apps on archaeological sites for heritage interpretation. The first is the ability for registered users to upload finds data to an on-line Content Management System (CMS). This is done over the internet using a normal web-browser. Information about finds and the archaeology to upload can be text, images, video and audio. These finds data can be geo-located in three dimensions using a graphic x,y,z slider bar system in the app to very precise points in 3D on the archaeological site by the user during the upload. By pressing an update button on the app screen, the new finds data are uploaded from the server and become clickable hot-spots in the app on the iPAD which shows the finds data in a new screen and also signals that there is new data for existing hot-spots. The hot spots move with the 3D model of the building as you rotate it around. There is also a Google Map view which allows you see the hot-spots in 2D in map form which is good for very large sites. The second innovation in these apps is the use of 3D reconstructions of the buildings associated with the finds and the way they are presented. The hot-spots appear in three dimensions in the buildings. In order to reveal ones inside structures or in walls and floors or underground there is a clever section slider which allows the user to see inside the buildings and their walls and floors. In this way it really is like digging down and through the building to reveal the locations of finds so that you can click on them. The app is free to download from Apple's App Store and at present are available for Apple's iPad only.

Part of the remains of this historic building are to become a heritage centre. The results from the development process and testing of this app have shown that public interest in using apps for archaeology is increasingly rapidly in the UK and both professional and community archaeologists find it useful to present their work to public audiences, often on site, to show how exciting finds can inform the understanding of the communities and landscapes where we live. It has been shown that presenting individual artefacts using the app can help bring the past back to life and engage members of the public in with the heritage of their built environment to an extent not previously common. The development and testing of the app has also highlighted areas which although functional would bear further development to make the easier to use by those with little or no prior experience, in particular uploading artefact data to the app's Content Management System (CMS).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d44a6fb11365.64448224</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Historic Southwell</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/historic-southwell/id1005018705?mt=8</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the final output of our Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) Grant AHL0132901 on the 29th June 2015 the Digital Building heritage Group at De Montfort University released a new mobile device app for iPAD intended for community archaeologists.

Presenting individual artefacts using the app can help bring the past back to life and the complex topography and architecture of the archaeological site of Binchester Roman Fort, can be better explained by the interactive visualisation of the app, increasing the speed of cognitive understanding of fragmentary and now hidden parts of buildings and the site's overall schema. While this apsect of the app and out put from this project was highly successful, there was only moderate success in affording the opportunity for community archaeologists in uploading artefact data to the app's Content Management System (CMS) because it was found that while this aspect of the app functioned well technically, there was a perception that the process was too slow and technically demanding for those with little or no prior experience. We accept this view and are seeking to develop an improved and more user friendly paradigm for this aspect of the concept.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d4471cec8a38.75073178</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Roman Binchester</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roman-binchester/id1005641817?mt=8</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E1E39FE2-4C70-431A-AD94-CA90F31241C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Driving Engagement in Heritage Sites Using Personal Mobile Technology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/422bf0fba11ee91cc7e4ce3ffde0e0da"><gtr:id>422bf0fba11ee91cc7e4ce3ffde0e0da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Corah T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>57383c298f7ec4.27567394</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L013290/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A30C52-7659-4E94-B5E2-F9BB53767467</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeological Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>63F3D26F-05D5-477D-9F77-C6C8AC47C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Research approaches</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
