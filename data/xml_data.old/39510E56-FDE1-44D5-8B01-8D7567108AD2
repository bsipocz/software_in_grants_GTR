It is a collaboration between the ESRC/HEFCE funded Centre for Global Higher Education and a cluster of NRF projects in South Africa located at the Universities of Cape Town, Rhodes, and the Free State. 

The International Centre Partnership will examine the pathways from an undergraduate education to personal and public goods in South Africa through three interlinked themes: access to higher education; students' experiences whilst studying; and the economic and social contributions made by university graduates. It brings together internationally leading higher education researchers from the UK, South Africa and further afield in order to explore the relations between these themes. In bringing together these three issues, it will further understanding of the ways in which an undergraduate education contributes to both personal and social transformation The partnership will also make a significant contribution to capacity building through the development of an internationally networked cadre of South African post-doctoral researchers, who will have the opportunity to work with internationally leading researchers in the field of higher education over a sustained period of time. These opportunities will be further enhanced by their inclusion within the wider capacity building and career development activities of the Centre for Global Higher Education.

The collaboration is ODA compliant because:
1. Higher Education has been shown to play a key role in the economic and social development of individuals and societies;
2. The collaboration will increase understanding of the way in which an undergraduate education makes this form of contribution;
3. It will use this understanding to develop resources for policy makers, managers and practitioners to further develop South African Higher Education;
4. It draws on the UK strengths in higher education research and brings together an internationally excellent group of higher education researchers;
5. It builds the capacity of South African post-doctoral researchers and includes them in a larger group of internationally networked early-career higher education researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following groups will benefit from the research in the following ways:
Higher Education researchers in South Africa and internationally: The research team will benefit from the synthesis of work examining admissions to, student experiences of and outcomes from undergraduate higher education in South Africa. Whilst South African researchers will benefit from the outcomes relating to a particular HE system, international researchers will benefit from the opportunity to relate the outcome from this system to other national HE systems. 

South African policy makers: Professionals in the policy domain will benefit by having the opportunity to input into the work of the individual themes and from their participation in the final conference. They will also benefit from the policy makers' guide that will be written based on the outcomes of the International Research Centre Partnership.

South African Higher Education managers and practitioners: Through the examination of the ways in which admissions and students' experiences support particular kinds of outcomes from undergraduate higher education, HE managers and practitioners in South Africa will be provided with research-based evidence about effective ways of organising undergraduate admissions and curricula. 

International policy makers: The International Centre Partnership team has strong links to policy makers, for example the UK Department for International Development, the US Agency International Development and pan-African Organisations such as the African Association of Universities. Given the renewed interest in the development potential of higher education, dialogue with these bodies about the outcomes of the Collaboration is likely to be productive and lead to greater understanding of the potential role of higher education in development.

UK policy makers and practitioners: The International Centre Partnership will also benefit from its links with the Associated Organisations (AOs) of the Centre for Global Higher Education (CGHE). This will facilitate the impact of the Partnership within the UK. These AOs, which are fully outlined in the Pathways to Impact document, include student, lecturer, university, business and consumer groups. 

The International Centre Partnership will use conventional and internet media to engage large numbers of people in its work and place it on the policy agenda. The outcomes of the partnership will be disseminates in the form of media articles, including The Conversation (which has just been launched in South Africa and is already widely picked up by the policy-focused media in UK and internationally, including the US). The International Centre partnership will also benefit from the fact that the Times Higher Education (THE) is an AO of CGHE. The International Centre Partnership will also benefit from space on CGHE's website. This is being developed into a responsive web and social media platform to support the Centre's communications, dissemination and research discussion strategies. It will feature an interactive website, with blogs, social media and a strong visual identity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118439</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop for PhD students at the University of the Free State</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80963AE6-1DCF-4BE3-8F87-F6EA5F8519BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There were two workshops for PhD students and post docs.
