Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0800370</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Cocaine is a powerful illegal stimulant drug. Abuse of this drug is growing in the UK and there is a pressing need to develop effective treatment interventions. The use of crack cocaine (the smokeable form of the drug which can quickly lead to severe addiction) is widespread among heroin users seekers methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). In most instances their cocaine dependence is untreated. Consequently, we have designed a multi-centre, controlled clinical trial to investigate separately the efficacy of two interventions: (i) modafinil, a medication for narcolepsy which is promising for cocaine dependence; and (ii) voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT), a motivational-incentive approach which promotes cocaine abstinence.

3 studies: 1. A recruitment simulation. At each of five sites, a 6-month recruitment simulation will evaluate the overall referral rate; the proportion of patients with cocaine problems; the number of eligible patients for the trial; the reasons for non-eligibility or non-consent; the retention of these potential study subjects for at least 8 weeks; and outcome monitoring of cocaine use arising from MMT treatment-as-usual. 2(a). We will develop a clinical quality standard protocol for adherence s at each site and also a specific therapeutic manual for standard keyworker counselling. 2(b).

Cocaine misuse is a substantial and rapidly growing public health problem in the UK. NHS clinicians have no UK-based, research supported treatments to offer. There are no trials underway in the UK and there is a pressing need to develop effective interventions. Rationale. Cocaine dependence is induced and sustained by neurobiological adaptations and conditioned responses and is characterised by chronic compulsive drug taking. There is a strong theoretical rationale for a pharmacotherapy that can normalise specific neurotransmitter systems and a behavioural intervention that reinforces abstinence. The use of heroin and crack cocaine is widespread among heroin users seekers methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) but cocaine dependence is untreated. Aims, interventions and design. The proposed trial is designed to investigate separately the efficacy of two interventions for the treatment of cocaine dependence: (i) modafinil, a medication for narcolepsy which is promising for cocaine dependence; and (ii) voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT), a motivational-incentive approach which promotes cocaine abstinence. The study will be a pragmatic, multi-centre, 2x2 factorial, medication double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in with 8 weeks of treatment. Proposed pilot work. We understand from MRC that a competitive application should be supported by data on the ability of the clinical sites to recruit and retain patients. Our pilot will address this as well as other aspects of our protocol, in a series of 3 studies: 1. Recruitment simulation. At each of the five MMT recruitment sites, a 6-month recruitment simulation will evaluate the overall referral rate; the proportion of patients with cocaine problems; the number of eligible patients for the trial; the reasons for non-eligibility or non-consent; the retention of these potential study subjects for at least 8 weeks; and outcome monitoring of cocaine use arising from MMT treatment-as-usual (TAU). 2(a). We will develop a clinical quality standard protocol for adherence s at each site and also a specific therapeutic manual for standard TAU keyworker counselling. 2(b). We will implement a small-scale, uncontrolled VBRT pilot at the trial co-ordinating centre. 2(c). We will study how VBRT can shape reductions in cocaine use as a first step towards quitting. 3. Pilot-test alternative methods of urine drug-testing. We will test the feasibility of an on-site rather than external laboratory quantitative BE test procedure.
