calculations in unconventional shale gas or oil exploitation depends on quanitifying and characterising &amp;quot;sweet spots&amp;quot;. Sweet spots typically occur where black shale deposits have high total organic carbon, stiff/brittle rheology, abundant natural fractures, sufficient thickness and maturity, and high gas-in-place. In turn, these characteristics are controlled by fundamental geological processes including organic productivity, run-off, diagenesis, and tectonic and burial histories - all of which vary from the edges to the centres of depositional basins (i.e. proximal to distal). Sweet spot characterisation requires a multi-disciplinary approach, and access to datasets that encompass the entire range of proximal to distal environments and tectonic or burial histories. Jurassic shales in NW Europe (Liassic, Kimmeridgian), include world-class hydrocarbon source rock that underlies much of the North Sea. Jurassic rocks crop out in coastal sections in the UK and northern France, crucially these strata, have been cored and logged in many North Sea wells. Taken in their entirety, these outcrop and borehole datasets should provide an unrivalled record of the proximal to distal transition within a mud-prone stratigraphic interval across a broad region characterised by varied, but well-known tectonic and burial histories. This basin-wide dataset has the potential to provide insights into sweet spot identification not available in individual shale gas concessions that comprise small, sub-areas of much larger shale basins. Further benefits would be to identify subtle, conventional stratigraphic traps, e.g. sandy intervals within an otherwise mud-prone sequence. Despite its outstanding potential, a rigorous basin-wide study of the Jurassic in NW Europe has been hampered due to the disparate and dispersed nature of the datasets. This NERC catalyst proposal will connect a multi-disciplinary team of NERC- and industrially-funded researchers at Durham and Newcastle Universities with industrial geoscientists. Our aim is to conduct a scoping study of existing Liasic and Kimmeridgian datasets to evaluate their potential for further in-depth research into sweet spot characterisation. Catalyst funding will enable us to generate an open access GIS meta-database of existing maps, outcrops, cores, cuttings and wireline logs that penetrate Jurassic rocks of the North Sea, England and northern France. To facilitate knowledge exchange and gain a deep understanding of the challenges of sweet spot characterisation, JARR will organise and host a series of industry-academia field- and core-based workshops in the UK and northern France that will focus on three key themes: (1) basin-wide variations in black shale deposition; (2) basin-wide lithostratigraphic controls on natural fractures in proximal to distal environments; (3) basin-wide variations in the mechanical properties of mud-prone sequences, held at key onshore localities. JARR will synthesize the discussions into an open access report that will critically appraise the Jurassic as a proximal to distal shale basin analogue. JARR will publish the report and GIS meta-database on its website (www.shale-research.org), available to industry and public. The project will culminate in a professionally-facilitated industry-academia &amp;quot;sandpit&amp;quot; meeting, which will develop proposals for a network of collaborative Joint Industry Projects (JIPs) based around the three key themes identified above. We anticipate the JIPs will either utilize directly the datasets identified during the scoping study, and/or develop questions raised and &amp;quot;lessons learned&amp;quot; during the workshops and sandpit discussion. The JARR proposal will help UK-based hydrocarbon companies to better understand resource to reserve conversion factors by unlocking additional value from existing datasets, and could ultimately provide them with real competitive advantage in unconventional exploration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65737</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>JARR</gtr:description><gtr:id>4FF0CEC4-66D2-4EBC-B2D8-9D25C299E10A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There will be a joint academic publication arising from this collaboration, to be submitted within the next 2 months.

The meeting brought together participants from academia and industry to examine organic-rich mudstones of Jurassic age and discuss the latest conceptual research ideas into basin-scale shale depositional systems and geo-mechanics, and their implications to better understand sweet spot distribution in shale successions across offshore and onshore UK. The meeting reviewed conceptual models of shale gas sweet spots, and emphasized the need to better understand what the essential ingredients of a quality unconventional reservoir are, and what controls them. Of particular relevance was the application of a dynamic model role of tropical atmospheric circulation, the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) - a prominent atmospheric feature defining the extremely humid core tropical zone - on the distribution and composition of marine black shales in different sectors of the low latitude Atlantic Ocean (Wagner et al. 2013; Armstrong &amp;amp; Herringshaw, submitted). Understanding how the dynamic behaviour of the ITCZ and the Hadley Cells on orbital and longer time-scales translates into sedimentological and geochemical heterogeneity of the marine shale has profound implications to better understand and predict the location and temporal and spatial variation in shale depositional sweet spots within a marine basin.

Of particular importance was the question whether natural fractures occur preferentially in clay-poor shales. Following this introduction, the group examined the Kimmeridge Clay oil shales in core, looking for variability of key parameters (lithology, %TOC, clay mineralogy, silt content, fractures) with the challenge of identifying the sweet spots. The core provided an opportunity to test the mudstone facies association and parasequence models Bohacs and colleagues at Exxon, and to investigate the possible control of sedimentary facies and mineralogy on &amp;quot;brittleness&amp;quot; and natural fracture development. The Hadley Cell model has significant implications for understanding the prospectivity of shale gas plays in the UK and Europe.

Expanded successions of marine black shale provide direct climate proxy records to test climatic teleconnections across palaeo-latitudes. The causal and generic relationships controlling the timing, composition and internal variability of these marine OC-rich shale over large distances and during variable global climate states are, however, still far from understood. Despite detailed documentation of the processes operating in individual ocean basins and under specific climatic conditions it remains a challenge to present a unifying concept that explains the generic far field interconnections between climate zones and ocean basins at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Progress towards such a unifying model would be an important step forward to simulate the location and internal heterogeneity of black shale formation more reliably, especially for areas where limited field data exist due to harsh or remote conditions, such as the Arctic.
Initially established for the Cretaceous subtropical-tropical Atlantic basins, we introduce a conceptual framework that identifies the generic processes linking the processes that connect orbital forcing with carbon burial across low latitude ocean basins (Wagner et al, 2013). Selected sedimentological, geochemical, biotic marine records are presented along with advanced biogeochemical and global climate modelling to show how the relationships between continental runoff and wind-driven upwelling determine the spatial distribution and internal heterogeneities of black shales in different sectors of the ocean basins, and how these patterns changed with global scale levels in atmospheric pCO2 (e.g. between mid-Cretaceous super greenhouse vs. early Cretaceous temperate climate). We argue that the identified processes, although targeted in low latitude sediments, are generic and thus relevant for polar (Arctic) regions.
The Hadley Cell model proposes that internal, small-scale heterogeneities in Cretaceous black shales were generically related under the ascending (tropical) and descending (subtropical) limbs of the palaeo-Hadley Cells, the main atmospheric circulation cell driving humidity and wind fields in the low latitudes, with fluctuations at variable time (seasonal, orbital, geological) and spatial (shelf, margin, deep basin) scales. These dynamic variations low latitude atmospheric circulation with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) separating the two Hadley Cells on the northern and southern hemispheres, translate into characteristic patterns of OM quantity and quality and sediment composition in both Atlantic basins, best preserved near the continents, where the forcing effects are strongest. Using a comprehensive compilation of bulk organic geochemical data - total organic carbon concentration (TOC), hydrogen index (HI), oxygen index (OI), and kerogen type - study explains how basic geochemical patterns identify the underlying generic processes and how this knowledge can potentially be used to develop a predictive tool for black shale formation. 
Global climate simulations of this Cretaceous setting identify a previously unrecognized link between higher latitude climate dynamics and tropical African climate (Floegel and Wagner, 2006), the latter leading to exceptionally high burial of organic carbon in the deep tropical Atlantic (Beckmann et al. 2005). By varying one of Earth's orbital parameters, the precession of the equinoxes, the model provides new insights to the dynamics of global climate during the mid-Cretaceous. Accordingly, strongest variations in atmospheric pressure occurred within the South Atlantic mid-southern latitude region between 25-55&amp;deg;S. The establishment of such an atmospheric tele-connection between the South Atlantic and tropical Africa, however, has been shown to be limited to one specific orbital configuration, which lasted for only about 5 thousand years, causing strongest climate contrasts in a seasonal cycle. These new observations are insofar relevant as they challenge common notions on role of the tropics as main driver of climate. The modelling results rather support the conclusion that tropical climate is ultimately triggered by climate change at mid-southern latitudes, with precipitation and river discharge being the transport mechanisms, at least for Cretaceous peak greenhouse conditions. The broader implications of this study indicate substantial interaction between the water cycle and atmospheric circulation on regional and hemispheric scales during times of global warmth, supported by large scale modelling of zonal hydrological and climatic patters at increasing levels of atmospheric pCO2 (Floegel et al., 2011).
We test and further develop the implications from the Cretaceous model by investigating new, detailed geochemical and sedimentological records from the Jurassic boreal ocean, where widespread deposition of the Jurassic Blue Lias and Kimmeridge Clay Formation occurred. Strong similarities in geochemical patters of reference sections from the UK Dorset and Cleveland Basins with those from the Cretaceous Atlantic basins suggest similarities in the depositional controls on carbon production and burial. We suggest that the Jurassic boreal sector may also have been driven by Hadley Cell dynamics, however, significantly modulated by variable surface water currents from either the Tethys ocean in the south or the Arctic ocean in the north. Building on this new evidence a preliminary model is presented, providing a first step to test possible feedbacks between polar and low latitude ocean basins and their effects on black shale deposition. 
Our first observations from the Jurassic boreal ocean are still preliminary but they are encouraging towards a more integrated model, in particular when short (orbital) time scale processes are considered. We expand on these fundamental challenges by identifying potential drivers and feedbacks that may have interconnected polar and low latitude regions. Amongst others, we discuss the role of super-continent breakup and the associated development of ocean gateways, providing new connections across latitudes, as drivers of the global climate-carbon system. Aspects that will be discussed include (1) role of warm surface waters in mid and southern ocean basins as moisture sources for large scale, long term ice build-up in polar (Antarctic) regions, resulting in global scale sea level fall and, through feedbacks of the global carbon cycle, changes in atmospheric CO2; (2) Extreme hydrological cycling in the polar (Artic) ocean during periods of extreme warmth (role of hyperthermals on Artic carbon burial); (3) Understanding the relative importance of low versus high latitude solar insolation as drivers of the Earth's climate. 
We argue that our study, despite focussing on two distinct time periods of the Mesozoic and the mid to low latitude ocean, provides clues to identify generic processes that influenced biogeochemical processes and carbon burial in the polar ocean.

A core was recently drilled through the Lower Jurassic of North Yorkshire, U.K., approximately 10 km south of Whitby and 7 km west of Robin Hood's Bay. This core allows the study of a fresh lateral equivalent of the upper Pliensbachian and lower Toarcian succession exposed along the Yorkshire coast. We studied the uppermost Staithes Sandstone Formation to lowermost Alum Shale Member interval of the core and sampled it approximately every 20-50 cm. We analyzed the samples for organic carbon isotopes, total organic carbon (TOC), and elemental geochemistry (major, trace, and rare earth elements). Using a combination of litho- and carbon isotope stratigraphy, we correlated the core with the classic exposure along the Staithes-Port Mulgrave coast, and our correlation shows that there are no significant lateral changes in stratigraphy between the two localities. The chief difference between the two successions is that the ironstones of the Cleveland Ironstone Formation are not laterally continuous. Our organic carbon isotope stratigraphy reveals a c. 6? negative excursion in the lower part of the Whitby Mudstone Formation, which we correlate to the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE) in the Dactylioceras tenuicostatum and Harpoceras exaratum zones of the lower Toarcian, and a smaller c. 2? excursion at the top of the Cleveland Ironstone Formation, which we correlate to the Sulphur Band and the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary. TOC values are generally &amp;lt;2% before, 5-20% during, and c. 3% after the T-OAE. Trends in our elemental geochemistry results show patterns of variation that we interpret as being related to climate and relative sea level. The supply of siliciclastic sediment during the deposition of the Staithes Sandstone and Cleveland Ironstone Formations was cyclic and may be related to transgressive-regressive cycles. Our data suggest that siliciclastic sediment supply was shutoff during the T-OAE, and we interpret this as a consequence of relative sea-level rise, which promoted trapping of sediment in nearshore environments. We therefore propose that sediments deposited on the northwest European continental shelf during the T-OAE are palimpsest rather than newly supplied detrital, and we suggest that some organic matter may be recycled too from, for example, Carboniferous sources.

Convened in May, the JARR partners gathered in the Wessex Basin to discuss the latest research into fractured and hybrid shale oil systems. The focus was to address the nature and controls on depositional heterogeneities, diagenesis, geomechanical properties and natural fracturing in hybrid shale-oil resource systems. Hybrid shale-oil systems are highly heterogeneous on scales ranging from microns to kilometres; quantifying and explaining these heterogeneities at appropriate scales are essential tasks which provide a basic description of the material and generate the fundamental knowledge required to improve both the location and recovery of the resource. 
There were two aims to the workshop: 1) the application of a causal dynamic model of tropical-subtropical climate to outcrop observations at Lyme Regis and Kimmeridge Bay. Despite being of different ages and distinct depositional settings, these sections have a mix of organic-lean carbonate- and organic -rich mudstones of Jurassic age. 2) To study the variability in and origins of natural fractures. Both aims relate to the character, stratigraphical variation and geographical extent of potential sweet spots in hybrid systems. A particularly important question was the inter-relatedness of lithology (at sub-metre scales) and the character of the natural fractures. Better understanding these factors is essential to reducing exploration risk and cost.

Research carried out during the JARR project indicate that it is quite possible that UK onshore shale gas or shale oil reserves are much lower than has been claimed. The thickness of the &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot; in the Kimerdige Clay may only be 10% of the stratigraphical thickness. E
Ongoing and future research aims to clarify this. However, recognizing this early in the process of exploration would minimize the risk of spending taxpayers' money unnecessarily.

&amp;quot;I have always envisaged black shale deposition as occurring in 'quiet' deep water settings, so intrigued by the evidence for shallow water deposition and fairly convinced. I was aware of the parasequence model published by Bohacs et al 2014, just one of many other useful bits of information gleaned over the two days which I think was time well spent.&amp;quot; (RPS, email)

The project was set up to conduct a scoping study of Jurassic shales from the UK, with the aim of using the data to understand shale depositional systems more broadly. Of particular interest was the use of Jurassic shales as an analogue to provide information relevant to Carboniferous shale successions, which are the main target for shale gas exploration in the UK.
Workshops were held as part of the project, at the British Geological Survey in Nottingham, on the Dorset coast, and in Alnwick, Northumberland. These enabled industry and academic participants to learn and discuss the latest research on how shales form, how they fracture, and how these fundamental variables impact on shale gas potential. Research carried out during the JARR project indicate that it is quite possible that UK onshore shale gas or shale oil reserves are much lower than has been claimed. New scientific models were introduced, demonstrating the importance of climate variability at orbital time scales (10 to 400-kyr frequencies) in controlling basin-wide shale composition and quality. JARR also showed how these primary depositional controls can affect the mechanical properties of shales and their propensity to generate, store, and release hydrocarbons during burial. JARR researchers have actively disseminated this to industrial, academic and public audiences at national and international conferences, published initial findings in a new peer-reviewed scientific paper, with further papers to be published shortly.
One of the key outcomes of the JARR project was the demonstration to industrial researchers that orbital time-scale climate variability explains many aspects of shale systems. The project expanded on the potential applicability of Jurassic depositional models to older shale successions, including the Carboniferous. However, it became clear that our understanding of UK onshore Carboniferous shales is strongly limited by a lack of complementary data that resolve orbital time scales. To address this, we are developing JARR-2. This program aims to work with industry and Government to identify sites for one or more research boreholes in the UK, targeting Carboniferous shales.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through JARR it has been explicitly recognised that there is a shortage of non-proprietary core and data on Carboniferous shales. From the sandpit meeting we developed an initial proposal for a shallow borehole (below). We are also in discussion with various companies in the UK, including those named above to discuss how to take the research further and how to set up a larger matched council-JIP funding scheme. 

Bowland Shallow Borehole project
 This pathway builds directly from work undertaken in the JARR project, and will focus on characterizing the Carboniferous shales of northern England. The JARR team will be broadened to include expertise in soil and rock mechanics (Prof. Charles Augarde, Dr Nic de Paola), petroleum geochemistry (Dr Martin Jones) and computational fracture mechanics (Dr Will Coombs, Prof. Jon Trevelyan). The follow up proposal will also build on external partnerships - initiated during JARR and other NERC-funded projects - with government agencies (BGS, NHM, Innovate UK Energy Generation &amp;amp; Supply Network), hydrocarbon service sector (Chemostrat, APT, RPS, Getech, Robertson) and exploration companies (Celtique Energy, Cuadrilla). The aim is to progress the research borehole concept to the point at which development of a full technical proposal is possible. The objectives are to: (1) develop a consensus view from industry, government and academia for a Carboniferous research borehole in northern England; and (2) undertake a technical evaluation/screening of potential borehole locations within the Bowland Shale resource area.
Objective 1 will focus on building support through engagement with partners, including potential funders, culminating in a multi-partner workshop to shortlist possible borehole locations. We have recently received funding for Objective 1 through the Durham Energy Institute Small Grants scheme.
Objective 2 will be an exercise in data mining and integration to evaluate the geological, geotechnical and cost implications of potential study sites. 

&amp;quot;Deeper Levels of Understanding&amp;quot; - Deep UK borehole/s research project with 3D seismic data acquisition and possible hydraulic fracturing. Project aims to gather multidisciplinary geo-energy data (conventional hydrocarbons, unconventional hydrocarbons, geothermal, CCS) to inform future UK energy policy.
