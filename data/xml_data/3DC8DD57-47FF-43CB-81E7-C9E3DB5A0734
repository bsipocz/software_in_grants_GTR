Clinical cases present as an acute respiratory infection with rapid onset pneumonia and in many cases death. To date there have been over 1800 laboratory confirmed cases, with 643 deaths (as 2nd October 2016) spanning 27 countries. Camels have been identified as the primary viral host reservoir for infection in humans (although infection in camels is largely asymptomatic) with secondary human-to-human transmission also occurring. Individuals with co-morbidities (pre-existing medical conditions) are at particular risk of infection, with the majority of outbreaks occurring in hospital settings. Over 90% of confirmed cases have been in Saudi Arabia.

There are current key knowledge gaps in the understanding of MERS-CoV - particularly the nature of disease transmission from camels-to-humans - that this project seeks to address. Through identifying specific risk factors for camel-to-human transmission the project aims to develop control measures to mitigate these risks. Such control measures must be culturally appropriate and developed in direct collaboration with high risk groups, to ensure they can be effectively implemented at a grassroots level. In addition the project seeks to identify key knowledge gaps in the understanding of MERS-CoV camel-to-human transmission that can form the target research efforts in the future. The project also seeks to establish Jordan, through Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), as a regional leader in international MERS-CoV research, surveillance, training and control. 

With this in mind the project will adopt a 'One Health' approach to achieving these aims, drawing on the expertise of a number of world expert from various fields including; veterinary public, human public health, epidemiology, virology and anthropology. The project will be coordinated by the Royal Veterinary College (RVC), London, working in strategic partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), JUST and the US National Institute of Health. Studies already conducted by the RVC in partnership with JUST and US NIH have already identified high levels of MERS-CoV infection among camels in the south of Jordan.

Project field work will involve random sampling of high risk Bedouin communities in the south of Jordan, collecting blood samples, nasal swabs and sputum samples alongside a questionnaire to assess risk factors for infection. A routine health check will also be performed at this time. Where selected individuals are camel owners nasal swabs will be collected from these camels. All samples collected will be analysed for evidence of MERS-CoV infection, and this data then combined with the data collected from the questionnaires in order to identify risk factors for MERS-CoV infection. In addition an ethnographic study w
ill be conducted to examine the role of camels in Bedouin Arab society and understand how potential control methods for MERS-CoV exposure can most effectively be implemented. Community health workshops will also be run among high risk Bedouin communities regarding the risk of zoonotic (animal-to-human) infections, including MERS-CoV, and give training and advice on how to reduce these risk.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A stratified multi-stage cross-sectional survey will be conducted among Bedouin communities and their camels in the southern governorates of Jordan (Aqaba &amp;amp; Ma'an) during the period April 2017 to April 2018. These governorates have been selected due to their high number of camel owners, long porous border with Saudi Arabia to the south and already established RVC relationships. Camel owning households and and non-camel owning households will be randomly selected in a 4:1 ratio using local government data of registered livestock owners. Blood samples and oral and nasal swabs will be collected from all family members and a physical examination performed. A pre-tested, structured questionnaire to identify risk factors for MERS-CoV infection will also be administered at this time. Based on an expected prevalence of 4% MERS-CoV seroprevalence among camel owning households and a 0.5% expected seroprevalence among non-camel owners (a risk ratio of 8) a 1:4 ratio of camel herders to non-camel herders and an 80% power, with a 90% confidence interval and a design effect of 1.25 to account for clustering - sample size has been calculated as 946 individuals, with 757 camel herders and 189 non-camel herders. Nasal swabs will also be taken from those camels belonging to selected owners. The number of camels to be randomly sampled per herd has been calculated as 11, using an expected prevalence of 15% and a confidence level of 80% and a mean herd size of 12. In herds of less than 11 camels all camels will be tested. Human serum samples will be screened using anti-MERS coronavirus ELISA (IgG) with microneutralization assay performed as confirmatory test. Human nasal and oral swabs, and camel nasal swabs will be tested by PCR to identify MERS-CoV viral RNA. All samples will be shipped to the US and diagnostics performed at NIAD/NIH Virus Ecology Group, Rocky Mountains Laboratories, Montana. Laboratory and risk factor data will then be subject to multivariate statistical analysis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The existing RVC / JUST twinning initiative, with additional input from LSHTM, represents an ideal vehicle for regional capacity building with the project seeking to establish Jordan, through JUST, as a centre of excellence for MERS-CoV surveillance, control, research and training - able to serve the entire region. With this in mind beneficiaries of the research would include the Jordanian governmental medical and veterinary services responsible for overseeing the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV. Due to the One Health nature of this study its findings will add to the research endeavours of those working in a number of different aspects of current MERS-CoV research. In particular, the work on identifying asymptomatic carriers will aid those researchers working on an improved understanding of MERS-CoV human-to-human transmission. Camel seroprevalence and virus isolation studies will help inform the development of vaccines and vaccination protocols and combined with the work on risk factor analysis for camel-to-human infection, will help inform researchers developing integrated MERS-CoV disease control strategies. The qualitative study will help towards informing researchers working in the important emerging discipline of zoonotic medical anthropology, along with more conventional ethnographic Bedouin research studies. In addition, this work will help inform future MERS-CoV disease control strategies with regard to culturally appropriate and effective interventions and the culturally appropriate implementation of future camel vaccination strategies. 

The main impact of this research however will be to safeguard the regional security and stability of Jordan and the Middle East. MERS-CoV represents an important biological threat to Jordan, which in the event of a large scale clinical outbreak could threaten to destabilise the already severely overstretched health infrastructures. Jordan is of paramount strategic importance to the fragile stability that still remains in the Middle East region, and is home to well over a million displaced people from neighbouring Syria and Iraq. For this reason effective monitoring and control of MERS-CoV in Jordan is in the national interest of both the UK and the wider global community. In addition MERS-CoV represents an important biological threat to global health services, as illustrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea with 36 deaths. With this is mind the impact of this research will also be its significant contribution to the current worldwide research effort directed at the control of this important emerging infectious disease. 

Communication Plan:
This study will result in the publication of a number of research articles in appropriate, high impact, peer-reviewed academic journals. In addition, this research and its associated publications will be presented at appropriate international conferences to maximise scientific impact. Consultation and training workshops will also be conducted in Jordan among relevant stakeholders, including camel owners, governmental and private veterinary surgeons, medical, university and governmental staff. For participating camel owners these will take the form of community development workshops, with a focus on zoonotic diseases and potential control measures to minimise risk of exposure. These workshops will build on a series of four previous Bedouin public health workshops conducted by RVC among Bedouin communities in the south of Jordan on the subject of zoonoses. The workshops will also form an opportunity for participatory appraisal, in the design of potential control measures for MERS-CoV, as well as an opportunity for qualitative, ethnographic analyses through group discussion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>481107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P02551X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>13981021-24EA-4648-A954-C235506E2CD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.2  Interventions to alter physical and biological environmental risks</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
