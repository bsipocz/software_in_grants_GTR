life</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K03748X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Mobility, wellbeing and the built environment: Wellbeing in later life is linked to the maintenance of independence, physical mobility itself and the sense of being able to get about. Mobility is vital for accessing services, resources and facilities, for social participation, and for avoiding loneliness. Thus mobility has been described more broadly as 'engagement with the world'.

The design of the built environment has a key role to play in enabling - or frustrating - mobility. Thus appropriate design or redesign of the built environment can expand horizons and support wellbeing. However, this project focuses on complements or alternatives to physical design or redesign of the built environment. Design and adaptation are time and resource intensive. Many well-understood mobility barriers remain in place because of budget constraints. Design of the built environment is just one the determinants of mobility and wellbeing. Any one environment cannot meet all needs at once, and needs can vary even for an individual, as people pass through key physical and social transitions which may alter mobility and wellbeing.

Based on participatory research, this project aims to create a suite of options and tools which may be able to meet contrasting needs, support mobility and wellbeing, and do so more quickly and affordably than adapting the built environment.

The research aims to: 1) Explore mobility and wellbeing for older people going through critical but common life transitions; 2) Investigate and address variation and contradictions in needs of different groups of older people (and even for single individuals over time), and between different built environment agendas; and 3) To co-create practical tools which can act as complements or alternatives to redesign of the built environment.

After a foundation stage the work will commence with interviews with national experts and stakeholders. We will select three contrasting local areas in which to base the rest of the research, and interview c15 local stakeholders in each area. We will then start a pioneering quarterly tracking study of mobility and wellbeing, working with c120 older people in the three sites who are experiencing critical but common life transitions such as losing a driving license, losing a partner, or becoming a carer. These transitions are often seen as key points for deterioration in mobility and wellbeing, and as key points for support and intervention.

We will then work with a series of small groups of older people in workshops and co-design sessions, to explore the potential for interventions as alternatives and complements to promoting mobility and wellbeing via redesign. Each will involve a series of day-long meetings between researchers and older people, over about a year. One set of workshops will explore how well 'crowdsourcing' and Participatory Geographical Information Systems can add to and collate information about mobility wants and needs and barriers. Another will involve older people with varying interests in relation to the built environment, to explore conflicts and the potential for consensus on some issues. There will be co-design workshops with older people to explore mobile technologies based on SmartPhones, to help people avoid key blockages to mobility in particular areas. Other workshops will work with mobility scooter users, and manufacturers and those whose mobility may be threatened by scooters, to explore the feasibility of adapting scooters to reduce problems. The impact of participation itself will be tracked.

Project outputs will include: a project website, accessible annual interim and summative reports to project stakeholders and others, a summative report, articles for academic journals across team member disciplines, trade press articles for relevant professionals, potentially video or new media, a local stakeholder and older person conference and national 'Roadshow', as well as other dissemination events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Plans for impact and pathways to impact are built into the design of the Co-Motion research, which has strong participatory and product development elements. C180 older people and c65 local and national stakeholders with be directly involved in Co-Motion. Key local and national stakeholders are already willing to participate actively, and will be willing and able to assist in dissemination and impact (see Letters of Support).

The project will progress over three years from open-ended interviews and discussions to fully tested prototypes, with substantial plans for dissemination and impact beyond.

The first main part of fieldwork (Workpackage 5 as described in the Case for Support) aims to have particular impact on academic beneficiaries. It provides new knowledge on the impact of key transitions on mobility and wellbeing and how they co-relate, adaptation over time, and variation between individuals.

The next major element of fieldwork with participatory workshops and co-design (Workpackages 6-9) aims to have direct impact on participants, and to produce useful and directly implementable tools, which can assist stakeholders and advance older people's mobility and well-being.

The participatory nature of the research, with workshops and co-design processes, will act as a potential mobility and wellbeing intervention in its own right. Social participation is known to have positive effects on wellbeing in itself. Any impact of involvement on participant mobility and wellbeing will be tracked through brief reviews at the start and end of the process.

In addition, the workshops and co-design processes aim to produce useful and directly implementable tools which can advance older people's mobility and wellbeing. For example, Workpackage 6 'Co-information' will result in low-fi and costed models of 'participatory Geographical Information Systems' (P-GIS), with guidance on the circumstances in which they can be set up and work well. Given the interest already expressed through pre-research contact, Co-Motion hopes and expects that one of the local authorities or NGOs amongst stakeholders, or others reached by dissemination activities, could take these models up in 2015 or 2016. This would allow them to collate information about barriers to older people's mobility in the built environment, and to inform their own guidance and practice, which might lead to better prioritisation of adaptation resources and/or management services. Identifying and altering just one barrier for change can make a great difference to individuals. As the Design Council argues, &amp;quot;a journey can be seen as a chain of individual products and services whose accessibility is only as strong as its weakest link&amp;quot; (Coleman ud p24). Other workshop and co-design outcomes include methods for 'crowdsourcing', deliberative methods for exploring and dealing with conflicts between interests and between different forms of guidance, phone apps, and mobility scooter adaptations.

This project has deliberately not focused not on physical design or potential redesign of the built environment itself but on alternatives and complements to physical change. Building on existing work, for example, by I'DGO, these are intended to provide additional options for stakeholders and make it easier for them to act, particularly given tight resources. Several of them are tools that can be operated at individual level or by users. Thus it is possible that they may contribute more directly to a sense of agency, wellbeing and confidence in mobility than an adaptation to public space made by a public agency.

An additional element of the work creates a typology of places according to built environment and mobility characteristics, to assist the matching potentially useful and implementable interventions to particular places. A final piece of work focuses on dissemination of ideas and outcomes to other audiences during and at the end of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1249599</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the 'Poetry in Motion' project, our Poet in Residence judged the winter competition of the Poetry Society.

York Cares is a partnership of the city's leading employers committed to making York a better place through employee-volunteering. Our Poet in Residence worked with a group of volunteers from York Cares in sheltered accommodation in York, to enhance the capacity of the volunteers to use creative writing as a way of engaging with older people. Our Poet in Residence has also engaged directly with older people in a Care Home in York. The principle underpinning this engagement is using the arts and creative writing as a means of engaging with people in later life who live with very limited physical mobility, but who can discuss and express a much broader sense of mobility. This latter form of engagement links with some of the discussions with our research participants in the study, who sometimes described not only their current mobility, but also journeys made in the past, and remembered journeys using photographs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>53F980C2-A28B-4D8A-8552-B70567C9659D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has enhanced the capacity of volunteers to engage with older people using creative writing, with the aim of engaging with people who live in sheltered accommodation or care homes across York.

We have worked with older residents in York, Hexham and Leeds to create maps of their journeys. We used touch tables with GIS functions to make maps identifying routes they used for regular or important trips. We then talked about the places they enjoyed along the routes and the benefits they got from being active. We then also identified barriers and problems. Finally we co-designed solutions to these problems from the older persons perspective.

We have worked with older people from more deprived neighborhoods of York and Leeds to ensure inclusion.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdc8afe219b0.30226674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.york.ac.uk/yesi/projects/design-for-wellbeing/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-Designed Mobility Solutions Survey</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DFE689C-13D3-4C01-A8D0-F5A5F9E279AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have worked with older York residents to co-design mobility solutions for the city that would improve their ability to remain active.

- Do you have any alternative solutions?

We have set up a survey website with a 10 minute survey visit co-motion.net

The results we will be used to make recommendations on solutions relevant for not just older people - but a range of people - to make York a place that promotes remaining mobile throughout residents lives.

We worked with the poet Anna Woodford, who has written a sequence of poems on mobility in later life as a way of highlighting the travel needs of older people, as well as disabled people of all ages. A collaboration with First York buses and Exterian Media has led to these poems featuring inside First York buses around the city during the first part of 2017 (and are still present at the time of writing). First York have noted feedback from the public about the poems (and we will identify the nature and extent of the feedback once the 'poems on buses' campaign has come to an end). Further, some of the research participants have also noted how their views and attitudes have been shaped by taking part in the project, as well as the positive impact on members of the public who have taken part in creative writing workshops.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>358E7448-9467-448B-9935-9C7B8922FE4E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deb9ee007d28.75963111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) We worked with older people over a period of two years to provide new insights into the impact of key changes in people's lives on mobility, and how outdoor environments constrained or enabled their capacity to be mobile. The research highlighted the process of key transitions on mobility, such as giving up driving, but also emphasised the impact of attitudes and behaviours of service providers and the wider public on mobility. The findings also posed questions for further research on 'care on the move'; that is, having someone to 'travel with', as well as the extent to which journeys were being made in order to give care and support to others. 

2) The use of Participatory Geographical Information Systems (PGIS) to map journeys taken by older people in the study areas identified both positive and negative aspects of the environment that influence mobility, and engaged with wider groups to identify opinions and views on key potential changes to the design or regulation of the built environment. This information was combined with findings from a photo-diary and the issues raised in the longitudinal interviews to identify the most significant problems and also the most popular solutions in the three case study a areas. This approach offers potential alternative mechanisms for taking forwards public engagement in the identification of local priority setting in local areas with regard to resource allocation. 

3) The practical outputs from the project were underpinned by new or improved methods and techniques for designing solutions to specific aspects of mobility in later life: 

? To make sure that such technologies such as smartphones and tablets are usable and acceptable by older people, it is crucial that older people are involved in all stages of their design. The project used a four stage co-design process with older people to develop a prototype app that would promote mobility and wellbeing. The co-design process led to design and evaluation of a &amp;quot;Walking for Wellbeing&amp;quot; application for smartphone, which allows older adults to plan walking routes in their local area. The routes calculated by the application were tailored to suit the needs, preferences, and interests of the individual user. The application is currently in a prototype stage and the researchers are investigating follow-up funding for a spin out in order to be able to get this app to market.

? Secondly, a mobility scooter pilot study developed new sensors and low cost mobile devices to provide an improved basis for understanding the issues faced by mobility scooter users. The pilot study also identified a number of key areas of future research into improvements to urban planning as well as mobility scooter design that could provide solutions for improved wellbeing and mobility for scooter users. Categorised under three broad headings of technology, safety and accessibility, the researchers are exploring new collaborations to take forwards the research questions opened up by the pilot study.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings provide priorities for action by practitioners and policymakers in local areas that have emerged from working with research participants and the wider public. The findings also identify broader lessons for wider policy, practice and further research both in terms of tools and methods for engaging with the public over design solutions in the built environment, as well as wider priorities for action. A challenge for policy is to facilitate a wider understanding and awareness of the mobility needs of diverse groups in later life, as well as disabled people of all ages, and how public spaces are shared and used. This latter finding sits within a wider context of practical solutions to raising awareness of the needs of groups in later life, including the development of dementia friendly communities, as well as the needs of specific groups such as people who live with sensory impairments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D2618BA-C915-42D1-A546-4B789BDE12C5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb9a9e69444.46713992</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.york.ac.uk/chp/expertise/co-motion/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written submission to Disability and Built Environment Enquiry, Women and Equalities Committee, House of Commons.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FB1C20C-35BB-4E14-A119-86D66D5DC9D8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c26dde913151.88842036</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The device you see in front of you contains Arduino board with sensors connected monitor pollution, accelerometer, GPS and microphone.

The prototype includes designs for complete user journeys for customization, specifying the features of a walk as well as the navigating the route. The prototype is designed in the Ionic framework (https://ionicframework.com/), allowing the designers to deploy the app prototype to different platforms, and to allow more realistic use in evaluations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9317D591-DA4B-48C0-8BEC-5D592BA6D87A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The methodology used for designing the app used an innovative photo diary study that collected over 600 photographs. When combined with interviews, this provided a powerful method for understanding the mobility issues encountered by older adults in their day-to-day lives.

The prototype has been evaluated with groups of older adult users in the three target communities of Hexham, Leeds and York. These evaluations have produced interesting improvements to the interface, as well as a validation of the types of customizations on routes users would prefer. The prototype provides an initial interface design and implementation that can be extended in the future. Additional funding is being sought through Innovate UK and RCUK impact acceleration grants. 

This work is of particular interest to clinicians working with patients with mild cognitive decline, where increased exercise can lead to prolonged periods of well-being. The research team is collaborating with Schulich Centre for Family Medicine at Western University in Canada who are interested in extending this work into full clinical trials.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c674c96015.51950664</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>&quot;Walkng for wellbeing&quot; app</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.york.ac.uk/chp/expertise/co-motion/outputs/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E66F286B-1619-4746-885B-8252C0791A98</gtr:id><gtr:title>Co-Motion: Mobility and Wellbeing in Later Life</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e902da3a2cb2a46975f5d68cf6791ab6"><gtr:id>e902da3a2cb2a46975f5d68cf6791ab6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bevan, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c1370a233cc2.28393791</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB1EF399-B4C6-4372-BC07-15DE5B184CF6</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of driving cessation on mobility and well-being in later life</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd80c6d62eaf724833aad2ca13eea7d4"><gtr:id>bd80c6d62eaf724833aad2ca13eea7d4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gilroy, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c288642598c6.42024481</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5326D241-D5FB-421D-ACCF-C95810A37C93</gtr:id><gtr:title>HOW CAN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT BETTER SUPPORT MOBILITY AND WELL-BEING IN LATER LIFE: MOBILITY SCOOTER PILOT PROJECT</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee222f44941ad09375b503d6785371a5"><gtr:id>ee222f44941ad09375b503d6785371a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cambridge, H.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c13d4f6a95e5.77408668</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43844463-3251-4FDF-8E2F-FC22BF80714A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of attitudes and behaviours on well-being and mobility in later life</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e902da3a2cb2a46975f5d68cf6791ab6"><gtr:id>e902da3a2cb2a46975f5d68cf6791ab6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bevan, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2878067cf89.20363309</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B312CBA2-1A2B-448F-88B0-6AD822EE513B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Three Case Studies on Methods of Working with Older People on the Design of New Technologies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in health technology and informatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6a21a4054e6af948b11470f5cecf5bab"><gtr:id>6a21a4054e6af948b11470f5cecf5bab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sani ZH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0926-9630</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c13c91a2a4f1.51608532</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F24B2C1E-D558-4BE7-8002-E86A85430BD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>HOW CAN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT BETTER SUPPORT MOBILITY AND WELL-BEING IN LATER LIFE -
