We will explain the results and learning to the wider manufacturing community. The tool must work at a number of levels: e.g. process, facility, local context, product, supply chain, offering &amp;amp; business model. The tool will be capable of modelling existing, known tactics (such as using waste energy from one process for another process) as well as potential future tactics (cradle-to-cradle, industrial ecology, localisation). The tool will seek to integrate existing tools where possible (such as manufacturing simulation and building energy modelling), though it is clear that such tools do not currently support an integrated model of material, energy and waste for an industrial system. For example, energy is often available as an output, but its media (e.g. steam vs motion vs electricity) and its timing and its location (e.g. at start of shift in the final cleaning area) are critical to the ability to use that energy elsewhere and current modelling tools do not support this. Our exploitation partner is a vendor of current tools with a vital interest in expanding their capabilities</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>112359</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>597628</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I000259/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>57100E59-FD6E-4C35-BC62-E1E4768D7AE8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ed9dce65ed9dcfa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project is one of the earliest in the UK addressing data based energy management in buildings and developing related energy efficiency framework for managing and eliminating energy waste. Since then the TSB, InnovateUK, RCUK Energy and Digital Economy Programmes have established several cohorts of projects investigating into this subject area. These academic and industry research projects feed into an exponential growth of an industry sector on sensor- and data-based energy management in buildings and processes. These include innovative companies such as NoWatt and EnergyDeck and also industry platforms such as the EDIE exhibition and conference series. Although there is no explicit evidence yet showing that the project has triggered these developments, it has certainly contributed to an academic and industrial environment in which these developments took place.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>96EAD5BE-5632-4893-A12C-0B915F005E7C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54662201e12966.18633520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>THERM aims to help move the manufacturing industry towards a more resource-efficient, low-carbon future by highlighting the sustainability and economic benefits of an integrated modelling process, providing insights and numbers on energy and resource flows to achieve potentially large energy and waste reductions. THERM seeks to integrate 'Sustainable Building Design' tools and 'Sustainable Manufacturing Process' tools to achieve an 'Integrated Sustainable Manufacturing' system. It is concerned with the creation of a new, innovative modelling tool for the manufacturing industry that simulates the manufacturing process as an integrated system of energy, material and waste flows to help identify more resource efficient and sustainable opportunities. Specifically, the project focuses on the development of a modelling tool that will assist the collaborators and other manufacturers in: 1. Understanding our current manufacturing system and its level of sustainability performance,2. Modelling potential tactics and technologies to improve (from a database of tactics), 3. Selecting appropriate tactics, &amp;amp; 4. Implementing tactics and technologies and monitoring progress. The project has achieved its objectives and an innovative prototype tool has been produced through a range of innovations in a new field linking buildings and manufacturing energy and resource use. These include real process data input, analysis and tests, and a system of implementing interventions based on an extensive library of tactics and case studies. The project has used the modelling tool on a number of real facilities of the industrial partners and the tool has been developed and refined through iteration of development and application. It was shown that an effective way of integrating building and manufacturing energy/resource efficiency is operation management based on monitoring and data collection, software-based analysis, and interventions enabled by a dynamic library of tactics interventions and case studies. This integrated approach as implemented in the tools developed offers the potential of major reduction of energy and resource use.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The application of the tools has been demonstrated at the manufacturing facilities at Airbus and TMUK. IES Ltd is further developing the tools as a part of their software products for wider use by manufacturing and other industries. The tools developed and insights gained within the project have been brought to the attention of wider user community through publications and major events, e.g. the EcoBuild and through the industrial partners Airbus, Toyota Manufacturing UK (TMUK) and IES Ltd.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>30736FEF-04CF-4CEF-99AF-F601C04D131B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5604726602.886548775f3d60</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.therm-project.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A05D31E-0239-4CC3-8957-26AD0C845B4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sustainable manufacturing tactics and cross-functional factory modelling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cleaner Production</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/db507ec274bedd29e27685f73250e6c7"><gtr:id>db507ec274bedd29e27685f73250e6c7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Despeisse M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff8ff8f209e70</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D9AEE6B-EA88-4A2D-B7F7-7F472B5632A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A new modelling approach which combines energy flows in manufacturing with those in a factory building</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9fbdbb3db0582d6fa659625a881eceb8"><gtr:id>9fbdbb3db0582d6fa659625a881eceb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M Oates (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_813005280113ee98f6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9D9DADB7-96FD-4E32-841F-2EA6314F8E4E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding Resource Flows in a Factory Environment - A Graphical Approach</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9fbdbb3db0582d6fa659625a881eceb8"><gtr:id>9fbdbb3db0582d6fa659625a881eceb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M Oates (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_402781854713ee9a18</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">TS/H001212/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6A482B09-D749-4443-8AF0-654984FCE91D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufact.
