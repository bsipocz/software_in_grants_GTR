Protein phosphatase 5 (Ppp5) and protein phosphatase 4 (Ppp4) are two of the enzymes that remove phosphate from proteins. They are found in every organ of the body and are known to be potently inhibited by several naturally occurring toxins. The aims of the proposed research are to discover their exact functions in the body. In previous work we found that Ppp5 attaches itself to proteins that are important in the growth and survival of living cells. Drugs that target this protein are currently undergoing clinical trials as anti-cancer agents. We have recently shown that, in yeast, Ppp4 homologues confer resistance to the anti-cancer agent cisplatin. Understanding how Ppp4 is regulated may therefore enhance our knowledge about cisplatin resistance. In the future, this may help to overcome the problem and so improve the treatment of cancer. Intriguingly, we have also shown that Ppp4 is attached in cells to the Survival of Motor Neurones (SMN) protein, which is defective in spinal muscular atrophy. Learning more about the function of Ppp4 may therefore help us to understand this neurodegenerative disease, which is one of the leading causes of hereditary infant mortality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Most cellular functions are regulated reversible phosphorylation, the removal of phosphate being catalysed by a class of enzymes termed protein phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 5 (Ppp5) and protein phosphatase 4 (Ppp4) are protein serine/threonine phosphatases originally discovered in my laboratory that are expressed in all mammalian tissues. They are conserved during evolution, potently inhibited by several naturally occurring toxins and are members of the same gene family as protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin, which is the target of cyclosporin, the first successful immunosuppressive drug.||One aim of the proposed research is to investigate the in vivo roles of Ppp5 using a mouse model in which an inactive Ppp5 replaces the normal wild type Ppp5. A second aim is the identify functions of Ppp4 in mammalian cell lines and gain an understanding the roles and regulation of different Ppp4 complexes by depleting Ppp4 using lentivirus delivered small hairpin inhibitory RNAs. The goals of this research are to identify whether Ppp5, Ppp4 complexes or their regulatory systems provide useful drug targets.||In previous work we showed that the major proteins interacting with Ppp5 were heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp90, which bind to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Ppp5. Interactions with these Hsps were lost and Ppp5 was activated, when cells were exposed to the unsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, or the microtubule depolymerising drug nocodazole that causes cell cycle arrest. Hsps are central regulators of protein homeostasis within cells, which guide the folding, assembly and proteolytic turnover of proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Drugs that inhibit the protein-refolding activity of Hsp90 are currently undergoing clinical trials as anti-cancer agents. The TPR acceptor site of Hsps, to which Ppp5 binds, is distinct from the protein-refolding site, suggesting that Ppp5 may act as a co-chaperone for Hsps. Other studies have pointed to a role for Ppp5 associated Hsp90 in the folding and regulation of the glucocorticoid and oestrogen receptors. Analyses of our mouse model system with an inactive Ppp5 should identify the true in vivo roles of this phosphatase.||Our recent studies have demonstrated that Ppp4 is essential for the maturation of centrosomes and the migration of human cells and may co-ordinate these two processes, suggesting Ppp4 may be a useful anti cancer target. We have found that orthologues of the Ppp4 catalytic and regulatory subunits in the yeast S. cerevisiae confer resistance to the anti-cancer agent cisplatin. Understanding the regulation of Ppp4 complexes may therefore enhance our knowledge concerning cisplatin resistance, which may help to overcome this problem and so improve the treatment of cancer. We have also shown a Ppp4 complex participates in spliceosome assembly and/or spliceosome maturation via binding to the Survival of Motor Neurones (SMN) protein complex. The SMN protein is functionally defective in spinal muscular atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease that is one of the leading causes of hereditary infant mortality.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1991-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>352451</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15498</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
