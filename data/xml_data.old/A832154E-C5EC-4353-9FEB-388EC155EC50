This will provide a basis for developing successful strategies for the effective implementation of sustainable innovation through design for behaviour change by public and private service providers with focus on SMEs. 

Design is a significant driver for sustainable innovation, because it is able to realise new insights and perspectives that are people-centred as well as manage uncertainty due to its catalytic multi-disciplinary nature. Recognised for some time, design for behaviour change is as yet lacking an overarching and coherent framework to include ecological, economic and social perspectives and approaches. The best-known area of design for behaviour change currently is sustainable design, followed by design for health and well-being, safety design, and social design. While research has shown significant opportunities, realisation in professional and public contexts is only emerging.

The project brings together a significant inter-disciplinary and multi-institutional network of key national and international academic partners and non-academic stakeholders with an interest in sustainable innovation through design for behaviour change. It will thus bring together two sets of stakeholders: key proponents of design for behaviour change from academic research, and relevant public and private service providers with an interest in facilitating behaviour change through design. This will allow the project uniquely to explore current key approaches to design for behaviour change in a wide range of applications, including safety design, design for health and well-being, and social design.

The investigation will focus on two main areas: 

The review of current key models and approaches of design for behaviour change, comprising Design for Sustainable Behaviour Change, Persuasive Technology, Design with Intent, Mindful Design, Socially Responsible Design, Designing out Crime and Design against Crime, amongst others. Including proponents of several of these theories, the network offers the unique opportunity to provide an overarching review that is able to draw out commonalities and differences between the various approaches and practices in the different areas of design for behaviour change. This review will form the basis for establishing a holistic framework that can accommodate and provide strategic co-ordination of the current fragmented approaches.

The project will investigate current understandings, needs and gaps concerning sustainable innovation by public and private service providers, and how to address them more effectively through the use of design for behaviour change. For this purpose, relevant non-academic stakeholders will be engaged firstly through a broad online survey to elicit current knowledge and concerns, and from which secondly relevant interested non-academic stakeholders will be identified and invited to participate in a number of targeted focus group discussions to elicit key data concerning understanding, challenges and opportunities of adopting and implementing design for behaviour change strategies.

The network partners will utilise links into the most important Design Research Networks and Design Business Partnerships to explore the needs and opportunities for using design research to facilitate innovation businesses. In particular, we will focus on how public and private service providers, particularly SMEs, can benefit from this research.

The network will produce a range of strategic outputs including an interactive online project resource, a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the field drawing on both academic and non-academic stakeholder views and approaches, and an international network on design for behaviour change, using a results workshop and social media to engage and communicate the project results to a broad range of audiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's impact among non-academic stakeholders will be facilitated firstly throughout the research process itself and secondly through dissemination of project outcomes through appropriate channels. The following audiences will be targeted:
1) public and private service providers and design businesses for whom behaviour change through design could offer new opportunities for sustainable innovation;
2) relevant sector bodies in design, such as the Design Council, who have direct links to relevant service providers and design businesses;
3) policy makers and funders concerned with behaviour change and innovation through design businesses and service providers. 

The project's impact activities will include:
- the project website and online resource to facilitate the web-presence of the project and make the project outcomes available to non-academic audiences and stakeholders;
- utilisation and integration of appropriate social media with the website to achieve a broad reach and dissemination to all potentially interested parties;
- the planned online survey will reach a broad non-academic audience and allow for their involvement;
- the planned focus-groups will involve key non-academic stakeholders to exchange and discuss understanding, opportunities and strategies for design for behaviour change; 
- liaising with appropriate sector bodies who will also support the project through dissemination to their members;
- publication of the final report and other relevant project materials online, open access to be widely available to academic and non-academic audiences;
- dissemination of relevant findings in form of industry journal articles and participation in industry events to a broad range of relevant non-academic audiences;
- interested non-academic stakeholders will be able to join the DRS Special Interest Group on Behaviour Change to engage in the activities of the network.

All impact activities will be planned and monitored through the scheduled team meetings, and evaluated utilising established processes which are in place in each of the partner institutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sustainable Innovation Results Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66F71B5E-906B-4CA4-83A7-E8DAE680F6F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results workshop was held on Thursday 18 September 2014 at the University of Wolverhampton, and attended by survey participants as well as a range of other interested stakeholders from business, public sector and academia.

The workshop enabled important debate on the significance of the findings, and how design for behaviour change can be developed and made accessible for private and public sector stakeholders in the future. An important aspect was also the engagement in creating case studies and examples.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542556ed410f76.81041215</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Design for Behaviour Change - Wikipedia page</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3A8A7FA-8CF8-4676-B736-30B52915D872</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The page is to be launched in November 2014, with the aim to provide information and awareness of design for behaviour change to a worldwide audience.

It provided insights into which theories and approaches are being used by non-academic stakeholders, and what obstacles there are to access and implementation. It also served to gather additional, current examples. 

The survey was conducted via SurveyMonkey and announced through the Design Council's Newsletter. It was open from 22 May-31 August, and reached about 32,000 subscribers. It was completed by 131 respondents. Of the 131 respondents, roughly one third were Micro businesses, one third Small and Medium size enterprises, and one third large organisations.

The survey results are published in the Full Project Report, and in summary form in the Summary Report.

The survey produced two significant impacts: 
Firstly, over 50 participants asked to receive the final project report.
Secondly, the survey was completed by a significant number of overseas participants, in particular the USA, Australia and New Zealand, several of whom indicated that they would like to be involved more directly in future projects on design for behaviour change.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54254f52bae656.79192173</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.behaviourchange.eu</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Follow-up Focus Groups</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55601910-8A76-4095-8BE2-0F3E2A6E1054</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the focus groups was to form discussion with non-academic professionals to elicit key data concerning understanding, challenges and opportunities of adopting and implementing design for behaviour change strategies. Particularly, this focused on use by small to medium size enterprises (SMEs) and how the concept can help drive innovation.

Two focus groups were conducted: one on 10th July 2014 at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, and one on 16th July 2014 at the University of Warwick. Overall, 30 respondents indicated their interest in participating in the focus groups of which 10 attended the first focus group at the Royal College of Art, London, with six attended the second focus group held at the University of Warwick, Coventry.

The focus groups offered lively discussion, and resulted in a list of recommendations of how design for behaviour change could be made more accessible and usable for professional practitioners. The focus group results are described in the Full Project Report, and in outline in the Summary Report.

Importantly, participants in the focus groups indicated that they would like to be involved more directly in future projects on design for behaviour change.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54255085f2b101.57664298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.behaviourchange.eu</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>531000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Designing for people with dementia: designing for mindful self-empowerment and social engagement</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>691001</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>42953DBE-67B5-4B19-A879-2A86BC7DC6A9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf4a6a941de6.82244814</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>By the end of the project (19 September 2014), the project findings have been publicised through an international conference presentation and the summary report, and subsequently the full summary report, which has been disseminated widely to interested participants from the survey, on the project website, through the Design Lab, and through various social media channels, reaching in excess of 20,000 people. Further awareness will be achieved through publication in public fora, e.g. Wikipedia page. 

Future impact, is anticipated will be achieved through raising awareness of design for behaviour change and its benefits, as well as of models and guides collected through the survey to aid implementation. Also, some of the findings of the survey are already being adressed: Some of the non-academic stakeholders who have participated in the project, are already taking some of the findings and recommendations of the project forward. For example, one of the non-academic stakeholders is developing a practitioner-led journal on design for behaviour change. This was one of the perceived needs of non-academic stakeholders, which the focus groups had revealed.

Other projects concerning the implementation of design for behaviour change in social and sustainable contexts are emerging as a result of the project publications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D3760CE4-310E-43A7-8C64-FF792DE4EA87</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5425422a7aa619.01374185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has reviewed the emerging field of design for behaviour change from both an academic and non-academic point of view.
