participation in online citizen science</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K039784/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The growth in the digital economy has dramatically affected the way in which people interact with each other and engage with a number of activities. Although the commercial and social aspects of this transition have previously been explored in some depth, third-sector and volunteering activity has not been subjected to the same degree of analysis from the economic and management sciences. This proposal will fill a significant gap in the understanding and modelling of volunteering practices in the digital economy.

The particular focus of this research project is the group of websites known as the Zooniverse, a highly successful grouping of online citizen science and crowdsourcing projects such as Galaxy Zoo and Cell Slider. Volunteers to these sites donate their time to classifying data of scientific interest, ranging from images of distant galaxies to weather patterns and cancer cells. 

This project will re-evaluate existing economic models of volunteering in light of data obtained directly from Zooniverse volunteers, including attitudes, behaviours and responses to incentives. The research will allow for the development of new economic models of volunteering and crowdsourcing that will offer more effective explanations for participation and engagement with online volunteering and citizen science initiatives. The project will also investigate ways in which volunteering levels can be increased and sustained through the optimisation a specific and tailored series of direct interactions with participants. The results will be used to refine develop new models for the management and organisation of citizen science initiatives in order to enhance the creation of scientific progress and social value.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Studying the Zooniverse from the perspective of the economic and management sciences will be important for understanding the motivations of online citizen scientists and their overall capacity for volunteering. Such work would be of great interest to the voluntary sector and is related to the desire of the present government to inspire the 'Big Society' i.e., increasing civic responsibilities and contributing to societal projects. 

Citizen-science volunteering is already being used in new and exciting ways beyond academia. For example, 'DIYgenomics' recruits volunteers to use a mobile phone application to look for variations in the MTHFR gene and their link to vitamin-B deficiency. Although this endeavour is non-profit, the output of the research may have significant implications for commercial activity. Understanding such behaviour is at the heart of this proposal and represents a major untapped resource in the digital economy. 

The Zooniverse is committed to enabling and encouraging educational use of their projects. A dedicated Zooniverse education group exists and the Education Director holds a position on the Executive Board of the Zooniverse, demonstrating the importance this role is held in within the organization. A website was recently launched (www.zooteach.org) to collect and distribute ideas for the use of Zooniverse projects in the classroom, and online tools (e.g. Galaxy Zoo Interactive) are being developed to deepen the learning enabled by some of the Zooniverse sites. By helping the Zooniverse to improve user's capacity for volunteering, this research will impact on these educational endeavours. 

Furthermore, by exploring the intricacies of voluntary activities in the Zooniverse, the project will be able to construct models relating to educational practice and therefore engagement. The detail revealed will be useful for similar web communities, citizen science and volunteering initiatives, as well as potential commercial applications that make use of crowdsourcing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>752948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of a series of short videos communicating the main findings of the project, this one focusing on the motivations to volunteer for online citizen science and crowdsourcing projects, as well as the importance of learning.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0794AB7-C767-4E9B-8EFF-AC3C2E478F28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video was shared widely with external organisations, including the British Science Association.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca6fd9ab9369.85373093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Project Outcome Video - Citizen Science Motivation and Learning</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/dUZfF62T2OI</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of a series of short videos communicating the main findings of the project, this one focusing on leveraging the power of the crowd by investigating the structure and operations of the Zooniverse organisation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>574CB815-AC4E-43A1-B211-F958DACB9EF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video was shared widely with external organisations, including the British Science Association.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca705f7b3693.78650994</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Project Outcome Video - Citizen Science Leveraging the Power of the Crowd</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/I8Oi9rrThM4</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of a series of short videos communicating the main findings of the project, this one focusing on gaming as a motivator, with particular emphasis on 'gamisation'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D60B25EF-1B07-4805-AAD1-0A83C20F5557</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video was shared widely with external organisations, including the British Science Association.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca7019708d93.20248049</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Project Outcome Video - Citizen Science Gaming as a Motivator</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/xTKElhJHBg4</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Care UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Lendwithcare</gtr:department><gtr:description>Lendwithcare Research Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>620E64FD-E655-42A1-91C5-0A4D8286D2B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary, involving collaborators from Economics, Law, Operations and Marketing.

&amp;quot;The VOLCROWE event was a very useful opportunity to hear from both academics and people working with organizations which use crowdsourcing. It was helpful to get a sense of the broad spectrum covered by crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, and to see that by sharing information with each other, we may be able to help our organizations to operate more effectively&amp;quot;.

The workshop, entitled 'Organising Work Online with Crowds', aimed to establish the key differences and similarities between the management of crowdsourcing in commercial and non-profit sectors, as well as the aspects of successful models that could usefully be employed in other contexts. 

The Professional Development Workshop was listed among the Academy Programme Highlights as an event of particular interest to the Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) interest group. The workshop was attended by over fifty delegates, with very positive feedback was given by those in attendance. For example, in response to being asked whether the session had enhanced their awareness and understanding of the topic, the workshop was given a score of 4.13/5. In response to a question relating to whether the session had affected their behaviour or thinking, respondents awarded the workshop a score of 3.56/5. When asked whether they would pass information from the session on to others, respondents awarded a score of 4.13/5. Specific written feedback included 'Deeper insights into open innovation communities, didn't know about citizen science before', 'Enjoyed the interaction' and 'Connections: met some very interesting people'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca6e0ae1e637.22164909</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://aom.org/Meetings/annualmeeting/2016/AOM-2016-Theme--Making-Organizations-Meaningful.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Festival of Social Science</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>19C2E423-EDCF-46A5-852A-686B92C4F0A6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e15a325d36d9.57504216</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>77216</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Data exploration - Creating new insight and value</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Technology Strategy Board (TSB)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>141AF7DD-318E-496E-927A-8DAA139BAED9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54624544c1d601.99276745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has engaged in significant public outreach and engagement with a number of culture, heritage, museums and collections, most notably the Manchester Museum and the British Science Association.

Online citizen science platforms use this approach to help professional scientists with the analysis of large data sets, which is particularly valuable when it is difficult or impossible for computers to interpret such data automatically. As part of this research project, we have investigated the motivations of people who contribute their time to online citizen science projects such as those hosted by Zooniverse.org. 

Our first major finding was that volunteers most often choose to participate in order to gain new knowledge, skills and abilities. In addition, we have shown that users expressing an interest in learning new things are more likely to analyse larger quantities of data and stay part of the community over a longer period. Our second and related major finding was based around conducting a series of quizzes with participants, testing their overall knowledge of science, as well as in specific fields linked to their favourite Zooniverse project, such as astronomy or ecology. We found that, while more active participants don't seem to know any more about general science compared with other users, higher levels of participation tend to result in a better performance in subject-specific science quizzes. We believe this is evidence that participants are learning about particular areas of science when they contribute to these projects. 

Our third major finding is that many people want to contribute to citizen science projects not only for the love of science, but also to be able to socialize, have fun and play games. Users sometimes do this by 'gamising' aspects of their activities. Some of the ways in which the Zooniverse team have encouraged gamisation is by making links to aspects of popular culture, for example by sharing LOLcats and other project-themed memes with their users. We suggest this helps to make projects appear more familiar and light-hearted, demystifying aspects of science that might otherwise turn people away. We conclude that these sorts of activities are vitally important for encouraging social interaction and building the online communities that are vital in order for these projects to operate effectively.

Our fourth major finding relates to the organisational aspects of the Zooniverse and involved extensive interviews with the many scientists and developers working as part of that organisation. We have concluded that the Zooniverse has been able to successfully manage both technology and the crowd by building a unique organisational climate that is rapidly-changing, flexible and informal. Members of the team are given freedom and autonomy to experiment with the introduction of innovative new technologies and processes, such as a project builder with tools to allow anyone to design and run a citizen science project. Working practices such as these help motivate members of the team by providing opportunities for learning, which makes them more likely to stay with the organisation rather than joining other tech-based companies. This finding has important implication for the orgainsational strategies adopted by online citizen science and crowdsourcing projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Based on our findings, we specify a number of outcomes that might be taken forward in non-academic contexts. First, given that citizen science seems to be a good way for people to learn, we encourage its increased use as a learning tool and more widespread coverage of citizen science in school and college curricula. By doing so, it might be possible to significantly improve society's engagement with science. Second, our findings suggest that encouraging gamisation and the freedom to play could be used more widely as a motivation to participate in group tasks, especially by organisations that aren't able to compensate participants with cash or prizes such as charities and third-sector organisations. Third, we suggest that the organisational models and strategies adopted by the Zooniverse might be adopted more widely among commercial and non-commercial bodies organising mass-collaboration and crowdsourcing projects, particularly those which run wholly or predominantly online.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6C6FCF8A-0374-441B-9C04-0E79335AB487</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e16c8feacc45.15229120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://volcrowe.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a publicly accessible, interactive resource containing all of the (anonymised) data gathered from our research into the users of online citizen science platforms, mainly consisting of survey results combined with actual usage data.
