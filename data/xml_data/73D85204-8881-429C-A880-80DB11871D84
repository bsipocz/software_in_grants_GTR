Set out to explore different perspectives on and meanings of abjection and related themes within the context of contemporary work organizations and labour markets. Provided a conceptual framework within which to explore more methodological and thematic concerns in the remaining three seminars, and the changing context of abjection and organization.



Speakers: Fred Botting, University of Lancaster; Yiannis Gabriel, University of Bath; Patricia MacCormack, Anglia Ruskin University; Alf Rehn, &amp;Aring;bo Akademi University, Finland; Marc Verlot, Equality and Human Rights Commission



Seminar 2, Loughborough University, 24.9.08 - Methodologies of workplace abjection



Developed the theoretical and conceptual insights of the first seminar by exploring different ways of thinking, researching, knowing and writing about workplace abjection and alterity. Considered how our knowledge and understanding of abjection might be developed and disseminated, as well as discussing the assumptions at stake in designating particular organizational research topics as abject. Discussed the ethical and political issues faced by academics, practitioners and policy makers when researching abjection and alterity in organizational life.



Speakers: Dave Holmes, University of Ottawa, Canada; Ruth Hunt, Stonewall; Maggie O'Neill, Loughborough University; Ann Rippin, University of Bristol; Samantha Warren, University of Surrey .

Seminar 3, University of Warwick, 21.5.09 - Being, doing and representing workplace abjection



Built on the conceptual, theoretical and methodological insights of the previous two seminars by exploring both the representation and the lived experience of abjection and alterity. Addressed issues including how particular groups of employees, and others subject to the organizational gaze, experience their own alterity and abjection; how and with what consequences abject status is ascribed to certain groups of employees and organizational clients; and the implications of this categorization for those who research and work with these groups.



Speakers: Bobby Banerjee, University of Western Sydney, Australia; Steve Lowe, Children's Rights Officers and Advocates; Daniel O'Doherty, University of Bristol; Kathleen Riach, University of Essex; John Troyer, University of Bath.



Seminar 4, University of York, 23.9.09 - Managing and legislating workplace abjection



Covering topics as diverse as sex work, terrorism, occupational disability and therapeutic intervention, the social and employment rights of transsexual and transgendered people and the politics of corporate diversity management (mainly regarding race and ethnicity), this final seminar drew together many of the themes discussed in the preceding sessions. Focused on the manifold deficiencies and unintended consequences of existing forms of management of and legislation around workplace abjection and alterity in policy and practice.
