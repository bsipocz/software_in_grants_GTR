Experiments on animals have shown that this effect is not related to reduced palatability. However, these diets are difficult to adhere to and have therefore proved unsuccessful as treatments for obesity. Establishing the biological mechanisms that mediate the beneficial effects of high protein diets may reveal new targets for drugs to treat obesity. 

Amino acids are the products of protein digestion. Evidence suggests the gut may sense the amino acids generated by protein digestion, and release hormones that signal to the brain to reduce appetite. My project will investigate whether a particular amino acid sensor, called T1R1/T1R3, is involved in the regulation of appetite and whether it is responsible for the beneficial effects of a high protein diet. These experiments will assess the utility of targeting T1R1/T1R3 to treat obesity. 

The gut responds to products of digestion such as fats and sugars, and similarly may recognise amino acids. There is evidence from both animals and humans that protein affects gut hormones which control appetite. The T1R1/T1R3 sensor was initially discovered in the taste tissue of the tongue but has since been found to be present in the human and rodent gut. It is also found in other regions of the body. However, the role of this sensor in the regulation of hormones controlling appetite has not previously been studied. 
 
Certain amino acids, including L-lysine and L-arginine, activate the T1R1/T1R3. My pilot studies in rodents show that L-arginine and L-lysine can stimulate the release of gut hormones that reduce appetite. Work carried out in cells (in test tubes in the laboratory) show that L-lysine and L-arginine stimulate the release of one of the important hormones that regulates appetite, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Oral administration of L-arginine or L-lysine to rats stimulates the release of the appetite-inhibiting gut hormones GLP-1 and peptide YY (PYY). . In addition, giving L-lysine orally reduces food intake in rodents. These data suggest that targeting T1R1/T1R3 may be a useful approach for anti-obesity agents. 
 
Research plan: 
 
I will initially determine where in the gut the T1R1/T1R3 sensor is found, and establish whether it is present in the same cells as GLP-1 and PYY. I will then administer amino acids known to activate the T1R1/T1R3 sensor into the regions of the gut which express this sensor in anaesthetised mice, and then measure the release of GLP-1 and PYY. 
 
A genetically modified mouse lacking T1R1/T1R3 signalling will be created. I will then administer the same amino acids to these animals and measure the effect on food intake and the hormones that control appetite. These studies will confirm that theT1R1/T1R3 is responsible for the effects of amino acids on appetite and gut hormone release.
 
Following this, a different genetically modified mouse will be created which specifically lacks T1R1/T1R3 signalling in the gut. The effect of amino acids on food intake and gut hormone release will then be determined in these animals. This will establish whether it is specifically the T1R1 sensor in the gut that is necessary for the effects of these amino acids in reducing appetite. 
 
The final experiment will study the response of the genetically modified mouse which lacks T1R1/T1R3 signalling in the gut to a high protein diet. I will measure food intake and body weight daily. The animals will be monitored over a 12 week period, after which their levels of body fat and lean tissue will be analysed. 
 
These experiments will determine the mechanisms by which the T1R1/T1R3 sensor in the gut regulates food intake and the hormones that control appetite. The results of this experiment may suggest that the T1R1/T1R3 sensor is a promising target for a new drug to tackle obesity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>High protein diets inhibit food intake and facilitate weight loss in both animals and humans. This effect is not related to reduced palatability. However, these diets are difficult to adhere to and have therefore proved unsuccessful as treatments for obesity. The T1R1/T1R3 receptor is a promiscuous amino acid receptor expressed in the gastrointestinal tract that may mediate the effects of protein on appetite. My pilot data suggests that specific amino acids that bind to the T1R1/T1R3 stimulate the release of anorectic gut hormones and reduce appetite in rodents. This programme of work aims to: 
 
1) Characterise the gut T1R1/T1R3 system. 
I will determine the expression pattern of T1R1/T1R3 in the mouse gastrointestinal tract, and investigate its co-localisation with the anorectic gut hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). I will determine the effects of T1R1/T1R3 ligands on gut hormone release following direct administration into those regions of the gut showing the highest expression. 
 
2) Determine the role of T1R1/T1R3 in gut hormone release. 
I will use mice globally lacking T1R1, and thus T1R1/T1R3 signalling, to confirm that T1R1 is necessary for the effects of specific amino acids on gut hormone release and food intake. I will then use mice specifically lacking T1R1 in the gut to determine whether it is T1R1/T1R3 signalling in the gastrointestinal tract that mediates these effects. 

3) Determine the role of gut T1R1/T1R3 in mediating the effects of a high protein diet. 
I will use mice specifically lacking T1R1 in the gut to determine whether T1R1/T1R3 signalling in the gut mediates the well-characterised effects of a high protein diet on food intake and weight loss. 
 
These experiments will determine the importance of T1R1/T1R3 in amino acid sensing in the gut, and will assess the utility of targeting T1R1/T1R3 to treat obesity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The data generated from this project will benefit a number of different groups. This data will provide evidence of the utility of T1R1/T1R3 agonists as novel anti-obesity agents. If successful, this project would lead to subsequent projects trialling such agents in animal models of obesity, and then in humans. If these studies also prove successful, such agents will provide direct benefit to obese patients. Current medical treatment options for obesity are only poorly effective and have significant side-effects. There is thus an urgent need for new treatments. An effective treatment for obesity would have tremendous health, social and economic implications. The obesity epidemic and the related diseases comprise a significant burden on the resources of the UK National Health Service, and on health providers across the world. Development of new, cost-effective agents to tackle obesity would have huge financial implications for currently cash-strapped health systems. 

The data generated from studying this receptor may facilitate the development of novel 'functional foods' incorporating T1R1/T1R3 ligands to improve appetite control and promote weight loss. The functional food market is growing even in the face of recent recession, but EU legislation requires scientific proof to support the health claims of products. The studies in this project would form a valuable foundation for any scientific health claims made for foods incorporating T1R1/T1R3 ligands. Such developments would benefit and increase the competiveness of the UK food industry. The discovery of a new food ingredient that could regulate appetite would also have significant implications for public health policy.

In addition, determining the role of the T1R1/T1R3 in food intake and body composition may also prove beneficial to, for example, the husbandry of economically important food animals.

It is difficult to estimate a timeline for such effects. However, if T1R1/T1R3 ligands which are classed as foodstuffs are proven to be feasible to use in such a context, the benefits might be realised within 5 to 6 years. If agents classed as drugs are required, the addition legislative requirements would mean it was likely 8 to 10 years before such benefits occurred.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Teaching on a course for school students</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B8416A1-1481-4EC1-AB7E-756B89940147</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Teaching on a &amp;quot;Pathways to Medicine&amp;quot; course.
