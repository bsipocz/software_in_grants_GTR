Recent anime (Japanese animation) and manga remakes in Hollywood, and in transnational cinema, have become increasingly high profile, including Dragonball Z, Speed Racer and Blood: The Last Vampire, plus the announcements of American Akira and Death Note remakes, all by well-known producers. As manga cultures become increasingly prominent in global film cultures questions remain about the impact of manga on visual culture in Japan and beyond. In fact, there is relatively little work on the importance of manga and anime to the Japanese film industry, and even less on the impact those media are having on a transnational scale. The project will therefore be formed of two parts: first, an examination of manga media cultures in Japan; and, second, an examination of manga and anime's adaptations for the global marketplace. These two parts will work in concert, attempting to bridge gaps in understanding about Japanese 'soft power' as a global phenomenon, while building on current work that discusses the success of Japanese media products at home and abroad.\n\nConsequently, this project seeks to investigate the ways in which manga are used as source texts for Japanese film culture, beginning with an examination of media franchising and manga-to-live-action-film adaptations in Japan. Manga provides the origins for an incredible range of films in Japan, from anime to live action blockbusters to art and cult cinema and yet, its influences on, and history in, Japanese film is relatively unmapped and under-discussed, something this project will aim to address. Indeed, manga tend to form origin points for large multi-media franchises in Japan, a phenomenon which has yet to be investigated in English-language academic work. Doing so would enable a better understanding both of the Japanese film industry, and of the ways in which Japanese media are produced and used in their domestic setting. The project will therefore use case study manga texts to examine the circumstances under which manga are adapted into franchises, and will offer assessments of the most significant forms of inter-media adaptation present in the Japanese market.\n\nBeyond Japanese borders too, the recent global visibility of Japanese anime and manga has seen a variety of borrowings from both classic and newer manga and anime sources. These film adaptations, normally live action but with a heavy emphasis on digital technologies, are offering interesting challenges to Western genres and audiences, especially in filmmaking for children, while also challenging conceptualisations of how digital technologies can and should be used. High profile, relative failures like the Dragonball Z and Speed Racer films offer potential insights into the problematic nature of translating Japanese manga and anime into live-action film, particularly around the use of digital technologies to bridge the gaps between Japanese and American culture. Moreover, the reasons for the choices of manga and anime sources by contemporary American filmmakers will be analysed, as will fan responses to their adaptations, in order to investigate what is at stake for the American and other film industies in adapting manga and anime products. The project will result in the production of a series of journal articles (which it is envisaged will later form the first two sections of a co-authored monograph), while also providing the impetus for manga and anime related events to take place in Norwich (and potentially London) and reports to be sent to industry and various other institutions. A central aim of the project is to provide useful outputs that cut across the divides between industry and the academy, thereby engaging as many potential beneficiaries as possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study has been designed to have multi-valent sites and levels of impact. First, understanding Japanese culture is valuable in relation to understanding Japanese cultural and business exchanges with the UK; in understanding how these exchanges take place and where points of industrial and institutional contact might be strengthened. Second, British cinema operates within a global marketplace currently dominated by Hollywood film. Understanding the power of Japan's media products in the global marketplace, commonly discussed as Japan's 'soft power', may have important ramifications and lessons for future British media production and distribution. Manga and anime film and television now account for approximately 50per cent of Japan's film and television industry production (Napier, 2008: 180), making them key elements in Japan's media 'soft power' potential abroad and at home. Examining why Japan's media products are being taken up abroad might help a range of British industries to find similarities with British media, and to make use of Japanese media models for production and distribution. Finally, understanding the Japanese marketplace for film and manga franchising has potential to help British filmmakers to sell their products within Japan. The Japanese marketplace for film has been routinely cited as one of the more important, with several major blockbusters in recent years (including Titanic, 1997 and Spider-Man 3, 2007) staging their premieres in Tokyo and seeing major profits from their cinematic exhibition runs in Japan. A more nuanced picture of this market could be a valuable tool for British filmmakers seeking to break into the manga, animation or film markets of Japan.\n\nTo enable the widest possible set of impacts, I have sought support and expressions of interest from the following groups, for the reasons listed below:\n1. British Film Institute - possible event in London based on the project, to include media practitioners as well as the public. Reports.\n2. Screen East - representatives have expressed interest in reading reports based on the project.\n3. The Japanese Embassy, London - has expressed interest in reading reports based on the project, and, in principle, with lending some support to any events that emerge from the project.\n4. The Japan Foundation, UK - have expressed interest in reading reports based on the project, and potentially in donating 16mm films to the event.\n5. Norwich's Cinema City and Forum have both been contacted about providing venues for screenings and exhibition events, both have agreed, but costs may be incurred.\n\nThe project will therefore have an academic impact through interventions made in media studies, while also benefitting the public through a series of events, and potentially benefitting industry and its supporting institutions through reports generated out of the project findings. The expressions of interest already collected above, demonstrate that this is a set of powerful industries globally, and ones with wide popular audiences, both of which the project could potentially benefit.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>144784</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keeping Japan on the Map - Invited Talks - Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation Conference 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCA87675-63BF-4611-B51B-0B41D683D672</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk: Rayna Denison, &amp;quot;Big in Japan: The Absent Industrial History of the Contemporary Japanese Blockbuster Film&amp;quot;

In this talk I laid out the early general findings of our project research, investigating the vast range of Japanese films that rarely get distributed and questioning why international distribution is denied to so many of even Japan's biggest blockbuster films.



Talk: Nana Sato-Rossberg, &amp;quot;The Lone Ninja Kamui Gaiden: From Manga to Live-Action Movie&amp;quot;



Here, Dr Sato-Rossberg performed an adaptation study of the migration of Kamui Gaiden from manga to live-action film, noting how that adaptation process worked to de- and then re-contextualise the text. This took it from a highly charged political text in the 1970s to a star-driven film vehicle in the 2000s. In this way, Sato-Rossberg was able to show how complex the processes of contemporary media industries are, even when mining their own histories.



Though dominated by academics, this conference also featured a range of other industry representatives, allowing us to make contacts, for example, with Sony and other important Japanese media companies operating in the UK.

After this talk, I was invited to give a subsequent public lecture on the Current Japanese Film Industry at the Japan Foundation in London.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2724163264.71060850bd7ce6a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>From Manga to Movies: Popular Japanese Cinema and Media Franchising - Conference Paper - Society for Cinema and Media Studies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>055DDDDC-0105-4C3A-8474-D1256DC32FD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Title: &amp;quot;From Manga to Movies: Popular Japanese Cinema and Media Franchising&amp;quot;, Conference Paper, Society for Cinema and Media Studies Conference Chicago, 7th March, 2012.



Description: In 2012, over 65% of domestic box office revenues in Japan were amassed by Japanese film productions (Eiren). I argue that this trend is the result of films becoming more enmeshed in local media culture, through a range of transmedia franchising practices. 



These practices have been developing since the postwar period, but were popularised in the wake of the declining studio system, and with the rise of powerful multimedia firms in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the clearest hallmarks of such franchising practices at work is the development of film projects through seisaku iinaki (production committees), in which a range of invested partners will provide monies, expertise and transmedia market space in pursuit of franchise creation. As a result, most of the top twenty Japanese films each year since 2004 have been adaptations, and many have been part of established franchises. Therefore, in this paper I reconsider how we might study Japan's most popular films as part of larger transmedia intertexts. I use a mixed set of theories including political economy and historical materialist reception studies in order to balance between macro-level understandings of the success of these films, and the practices and processes underpinning specific successes at a micro-economic level. In this way, I attempt to offer a new means for understanding Japanese cinema as part of a wider popular media landscape emerging out of Japanese culture.



The SCMS Conference is the most prestigious for film and media studies. I was also part of a workshop panel on transnational media research at SCMS in this same year, and, as a result of the project, have been invited to partake in a similar workshop next year about managing transnational research projects.

After this talk, I was invited to become a founding member of the Transnational Cinemas Special Interest Group at SCMS.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4816854786.8885610cbc5198</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>From Manga to Movies: New Trends in Collaborative Production in Japanese Media Franchising - Conference Paper - MeCCSA 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>556B875F-1951-4AEC-8C25-9B49D16E1984</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Title: &amp;quot;From Manga to Movies: New Trends in Collaborative Production in Japanese Media Franchising&amp;quot;, 12th January, 2012, Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association (UK)


Authors: Dr Hiroko Furukawa and Dr Rayna Denison (Joint Paper &amp;amp; Delivery)



Description: Much of the work previously undertaken on Japanese cinema has taken either directors or texts as its organising principle (Burch, Bordwell, Richie, Desser, McDonald). Our AHRC-funded research project simply seeks to resituate Japanese filmmaking within the contexts of production and consumption; to seek out the industrial explanations for why films get made in Japan and who watches them. This paper is intended to outline one of our most significant findings; namely, the production system referred to in Japanese as seisakuiinkai, which can be translated as &amp;quot;production committee.&amp;quot;



MeCCSA is the most important conference in the UK for media studies, so speaking about our early findings there helped to ensure a broad, UK-based dissemination of our work. The panel was well-attended by some of the UK's most high profile scholars. It was also one of Hiroko's earliest experiences of giving a conference paper, and working with her on it helped to develop her confidence for future papers.

We used feedback from this audience to improve the communication of our findings for the final research project reports.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8590060787.824970c13bf2e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Whose Japanese Cinema?: Japan's Transnationally Invisible Popular Film Cultures - Invited Talk - Yale University, Japan Colloquium Series</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2CE768D-9675-49A7-B26F-3987B16316CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk: &amp;quot;Whose Japanese Cinema?: Japan's Transnationally Invisible Popular Film Cultures&amp;quot;, Yale University, 5th November, 2012 



Description: Academic writing reveals, in many cases, an understanding of Japanese cinema based on a selective transnational canon of films. Consequently, the majority of academic writings on Japanese films are about films that have received at least limited transnational distribution. Often times, these writings are about those films that have most emphatically crossed between countries. For example, we have much more academic work on Japan's famous &amp;quot;Golden Age&amp;quot; directors like Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu, and more work on critically lauded newer directors like Hayao Miyazaki and Takeshi Kitano, than we have on the vast majority of domestically successful directors. This talk is therefore an attempt to begin to rethink whose history of Japanese cinema we are writing; the history of cinema in Japan; or, a history led only by those films that circulate beyond Japan's borders? Refocusing attention on the contemporary domestic market for films, this talk traces several new trends in Japanese filmmaking (animated and live action) that are largely invisible to a transnational definition of &amp;quot;Japanese cinema.&amp;quot; It highlights several new production trends, as well as intensifications of long-standing traditions in Japanese genres, industrial structures and production techniques to make visible some of the hidden popular majority of Japanese filmmaking. In performing this re-examination of the domestic Japanese film markets, the aim is to reconsider how we conceptualise Japanese cinema, to move away from notions of transnational and &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; filmmaking and closer towards what audiences in Japan are actually watching. 



I was invited to share the interim findings of our Project with Japanese Cinema scholars and students at Yale University. The group I spoke to was mainly comprised of postgraduate students of Japanese language and culture.

This talk is part of Yale University's longstanding and highly regarded Japanese Studies lecture series. It is a means to share the findings of our project with an international audience of world-leading scholars working on Japan's media industries and history. I have since met with these researchers at other conferences and we continue to share information, with a view to possible future collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9962561363.3194580c1444a8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Japanese Cinema Now - Invited Lecture: Japanese Cinema for Busy People, Japan Foundation Lecture Series, 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB1062CD-97F7-4909-BC87-67F5E80346BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited public lecture at the Japan Foundation, London, as part of their Japanese Cinema for Busy People lecture series, 11th July, 2012. 

Talk title: Japanese Cinema Now: Production Trends in Contemporary Japanese Cinema



Description:

Japanese cinema has been making a quiet comeback over the past decade. While many people outside Japan will know the blockbuster peak of this phenomenon - the films of

Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, Ponyo) - the iceberg of film production

hidden from view within Japan deserves much greater attention.Popular films in Japan now

are big business - they are usually part of bigger social phenomena (real-life stories, manga

and television drama adaptations, cute celebrity animals) and they can gross $100million or

more at the domestic box office. This talk investigates the history behind the rise of this new

&amp;quot;big hit&amp;quot; cycle of Japanese filmmaking. It asks why these films are so successful and why,

despite their domestic success, they often remain hidden from (English) view. 



This talk disseminated the early findings of the research project, allowing us to disseminate the core findings and ideas to the public at an early stage of the project. There was a relatively large audience including Japanese media distribution professionals and the general public (approximately 50-70 people).

After my talk, I gained additional informal contacts with distributors and was subsequently invited back to do another event on the Japanese film industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-92286765.661357690c149750</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Japan Foundation Endowment Committee: Symposium on Contemporary Japanese Media Cultures</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Japan Foundation Endowment Committee</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>6C0AEB17-EFF8-4493-BB39-B8527C481220</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ebdd8705ebdd884</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Japanese Art Through Movies: Screening Series</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8E095D97-8B8D-4E23-B004-D8C4516A4421</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2119320074.20744750687b70c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Japan Foundation Endowment Committee: Symposium on Contemporary Japanese Media Cultures</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Japan Foundation Endowment Committee</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B85C59A2-6076-44C0-B919-1CE496787616</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1041519559.02717960687a5dc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project primarily benefited UK media industry professionals working around the distribution/exhibition of Japanese media; as well as those working to reproduce and subtitle Japanese cinema within the UK; and being used by UK-Japan Third Sector Organisations. Primary Impact Element of Project: Project Reports: Provision of 2 Evidence-based Reports for Industry &amp;amp; Third Sector Description of Project Reports: The Reports were designed to provide an evidence-based overview and analysis of Japan's media industries. This was intended to benefit those working with Japan's media industries to distribute texts, promote Japanese culture and so on. Therefore, the Reports were designed to contain up-to-date information that would be new to professionals. They were also designed to show how those industries link to one another. The impact statements collected to date show that we have had a positive impact on UK industry-members' confidence in working with Japanese media industry producers. Impact Statement: The Project Reports provide a concrete location through which industry and other professionals can access our Project findings as and whenever they choose to do so. We sent out information about the reports to over 25 UK-based institutions that have a stake in Japanese media culture in the UK, and heard back from six regarding the project findings, as well as hearing from an additional 4 international academics who sent us positive feedback unsolicited, helping us build up a larger network of scholars interested in contemporary Japanese media. Several recipients of our Project Reports (four in total) working in UK industries and charities related to Japan have told us that these Reports have given them an evidence-basis to support what they had assumed was going on in Japan's media industries. For example, Andrew Kirkham, CEO of subtitling company Silk Purse, states, &amp;quot;In a way it is bizarre reading these given that a lot of the observations and / or conclusions in the reports we glean by osmosis, gut instinct and business sense rather than any real intellectual ponderings.&amp;quot; In essence, Kirkham confirms that the UK industry has lacked an evidence-based foundation from which to build industrial practice, and that using our Reports gives him greater confidence in his business dealings. A similar impact was also generated through Cult TV Times, a new online magazine edited by Mr Hugh K. David, who told us that although he had long worked within industries reproducing anime in the UK, he had never had access to concrete information of this kind. Likewise, Junko Takekawa of the UK brand of charity the Japan Foundation comments that: &amp;quot;Generally speaking, we, practitioners, do not have a time to do research on the Japanese cinema or trends that exists in the world. Therefore the academic research such as this will be useful to not only to allow us to find out the detail with facts and reason, but also to authenticate our understanding and knowledge which we pick up from the daily business was actually correct.&amp;quot; Our Reports are therefore helping to authenticate pre-existing common-sense understandings of Japan's media industries meaning that these reports are providing an evidence-based future starting point for UK industry professionals and charity group's engagements with Japanese media industries. This is confirmed by Kirkham, who continued his response by saying: &amp;quot;The transmedia report was fascinating in giving an overview of things like the Seisakuiinkai situation, which is almost non-existent in western film business structure. I have had to deal with and fight with this system many times over the years.&amp;quot; Our Reports (and with them the Project) are thus having a demonstrable impact on industries and charitable organisations, acting as a useful source of information, and as a source of confidence, helping professionals to engage in deeper ways with their Japanese counterparts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>348A71BB-44A8-4517-9C87-95FF25F2DD73</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b883cb21e00.59423181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary of project findings

In this project we investigated the production of franchising, adaptation and transmedia production in Japan. We did so in a period of considerable upheaval, change and difficulty for Japan, beginning our research just as the Great East Earthquake Disaster happened in March 2011. This disaster, and the fast changing worlds of new media have both had significant unexpected impacts on our work, altering the scope and findings of our research. Overall, we found that the worlds of manga, anime, TV dramas, games software, filmmaking and other types of media are deeply connected and becoming increasingly so. These connections are taking place at the level of institutions, industries and individual productions, all of which impact on how Japanese media travel abroad, making these findings relevant to industry, third sector and policy makers in the UK and elsewhere. Our investigations of the current manga, anime and film industries have revealed diverse patterns in how media producers are responding to the fast-changing local and global media landscapes.

Our most significant findings are laid out below, and we have two Reports, available to all online (at http://www.mangamoviesprojec.com/publications), that more fully outline the contexts of these findings and how they relate to one another:

? Japanese Media Business Practices: The media industries in Japan, as elsewhere, contain examples of conglomerates, partnerships and other industrial arrangements that are shifting media production strategies towards greater levels of connectivity between texts.
? Seisakuiinkai (production committees): Production committees are groups of Japanese companies that come together in order to produce a particular franchise through 'media mix' strategies. They dominate the media production landscape in Japan, creating sometimes long-standing collectives that reduce competition as companies join together to create pre-planned media franchises.
? Competition: The locus of media competition in Japan is consequently shifting to the level of competing franchises, rather than more simple competition between media texts
? Intellectual Property/Content Exploitation: The work of seisakuiinkai places greater emphasis on intellectual properties ('contents' in Japanese) exploitation across a range of media platforms. This can be simultaneous or piecemeal. It also means that adaptation has become a key practice in contemporary Japanese media production.
? Rapid Changes in Media Trends: As a result of these practices, there is a quick turnover in production trends leading to the creation of a wide range of new media platforms, genres and categories as seisakuiinkai seek new ways to exploit intellectual properties.
? Manga's Prominence as an Adaptation Source: Among the original sources used to create multi-media franchises in Japan, manga remains the most significant. It inspires a wide variety of franchising types, ranging from direct adaptations to widely dispersed networks of texts.
? Transnational Markets for Japanese Media: These practices create challenges for distributors based outside of Japan, who often receive small parts of pre-existing franchises (often single texts from a franchise) with little of the surrounding texts, merchandising and publicity outlets enjoyed by their Japanese counterparts. Since the declines in the DVD markets, and a shift towards online media consumption, the transnational landscape of Japanese media distribution has starkly shifted, with a reduction in the numbers of companies involved.
? Misalignment of Transnational Expectations: There are discrepancies between the markets for manga, anime and Japanese films within and outside of Japan that have created misalignments in the pricing of texts.
? Digital Shift: Shifts into the digital landscape of distribution are creating new potential and challenges for all, with the closure of many international distribution businesses, but also the creation of newer, online only distribution hubs.
? Future Directions: There are increasing numbers of pre-planned franchises in Japan taking a 'boom' approach, wherein large numbers of texts relating to a single intellectual property are released near-simultaneously. Similarly, Japanese seisakuiinkai and overseas distributors are working to reduce the time-lag in transnational distribution by undertaking greater levels of simultaneous 'global' releases.
? Decline in Weekly Manga Magazines: Weekly manga anthology magazines are in decline, and abroad have already begun to be replaced by digital versions; whereas, in Japan, a more mixed set of digital and paper releases continues.
? Steady Market for Tankobon: Collections of 'episodes' of a single manga stories into tankobon (collected editions) are remaining flat, but retaining their market in Japan; whereas, outside of Japan, the sales of tankobon have declined sharply since 2007, prompting transnational company closures and a shift to online sales.
? Digital/Online Manga Publication?: The Japanese industry has yet to treat online publication as a core strategy for popular texts, nor has it found a means to satisfactorily make online manga profitable in the domestic market, which is largely a result of shifting technology platforms and a lack of an obvious technological way forward.
? Possibilities for Expansion in Overseas Manga Markets: Transnational experiments in online manga are among the most high-potential current digital manga experiments, opening up large markets like China to wide-scale manga distribution.
? Making TV Anime at a Loss?: Our investigations outline the paths taken to pay back the expenses of television broadcasting for anime, with profit sources ranging from ancillary merchandising, to franchising and the production of live events all undertaken to recoup costs.
? Film and Anime use Seisakuiinkai: Production committees are a main route to off-setting costs and organising the streams of textual production and management needed to produce both TV anime and live action film hits.
? TV Anime Numbers Rising in the Long-Term: Despite short-term dips, the long-term picture shows booms and plateaus in TV anime production that have raised the numbers of anime shown on Japanese TV across time.
? Shinya Anime: Late night anime shows, with fewer restrictions and aimed at a more adult audience, have become a major feature of the anime market over the past decade, creating a new origin point for anime films.
? New Anime 'Classics': Teiban (classic) has become the term used to describe new anime that become popular and subsequently get turned into huge multi-media franchises. They most often come from the family and children's markets for anime.
? OVAs Reborn: Original Video Animation has returned, by-passing television through cinema exhibition and releases straight-to-DVD and Blu-ray.
? The Studio Ghibli Effect: Japan's power-house animation studio has the power to not only skew the figures for anime, but to massively impact the year-on-year figures for the whole of Japan's media markets including the overall domestic box office, television broadcasting and DVD sales. We dub this the 'Ghibli effect'.
? Japanese Film Retakes Local Box-Office: In a major development not seen since the 1960s, Japanese domestic films now routinely account for just over half of the box office in their home market.
? New Culture of Hit Filmmaking: There is a new language for 'hit' films in Japanese, with the top 'mega hits' being those making over &amp;yen;5 billion. This has brought new producers into filmmaking in Japan, most notably TV production companies.
? Rising Screen Numbers: A multiplex construction boom starting in the 1990s has seen huge rises in total screen numbers in Japan, creating new kinds of filmgoing cultures and requiring more domestic film.
? DVD Market Declining?: We show how local films are still succeeding in the home video markets, despite overall declines in DVD sales.
? TV Broadcasting and Hit Films: Hit films, often made by TV producers, are proving useful in the way they create seasons of programming that draw large audiences. In this regard, serial film production aids TV producers turned film producers.

In these major findings we have been able to contradict commonplace academic understandings of Japanese film, anime and manga as separate industries. This understanding has developed because of the way manga are distributed outside of Japan, not within it, and so we hope that our Project Reports, and the academic articles we have produced based on these findings, will act as a corrective measure for debates around Japanese media production within and beyond academia. These findings demonstrate how interlinked Japan's media industries are, and how dependent they are upon one another for success. They also demonstrate that, despite claims about Japan's expanding global &amp;quot;soft power,&amp;quot; the picture within Japan is a mixed one with industries in decline as well as expansion. In total, therefore, this Project and its findings should make a significant difference to those working in and around Japanese media.


Moreover, our Reports bring together disparate Japanese and English-language reporting on the &amp;quot;soft power&amp;quot; potential of Japanese media, an aspect of Japanese economic power that has been widely discussed of late in both the global popular media and within academia. In bringing together the available data from Japanese and English sources, our Reports offer a &amp;quot;one-stop&amp;quot; location for those wishing to familiarise themselves with current Japanese media production processes and practices. In this way, the celebration of Japanese media's global &amp;quot;soft power&amp;quot; can be qualified and made more realistic, by referencing their (sometimes lack of) impact within global media markets. As a corrective to the hyperbole around Japan's global media success story, these Reports are likewise intended to be useful to policy makers in the UK who may be seeking to follow in Japan's media footsteps.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The major findings of our project should be informative for anyone researching (in academia but also beyond it) the contexts of Japanese media production. Media companies now routinely contain marketing departments whose members are seeking reliable information about the potential of foreign texts to cross international borders. We have, therefore, made every effort to ensure that our Project Reports (http://www.mangamoviesproject.com) will be available to, and have value for, those in ancillary media industries supporting the distribution of Japanese culture outside Japan (from charities like the Japan Foundation, to DVD distributors and those providing sub-titling for Japanese media products). In addition, they should be useful to those with a more general interest in what is happening within Japanese media cultures right now (from fans to students of Japanese culture). Therefore, our Reports are intended provide a helpful guide to anyone looking to discuss or disseminate Japanese media culture outside of Japan, to enable them to see the wider contexts of media production in that nation, and how those contexts might positively or negatively impact on the potential success of distribution beyond the Japanese domestic market.
