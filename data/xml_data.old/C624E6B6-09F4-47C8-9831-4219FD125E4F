A creature's genetic sequence is a long string of symbols. But how can we discuss common ancestors if, instead of knowing strings of symbols about each creature, we only have information about their shapes? Though this is a particularly difficult situation, it is very common. Many objects in the world around us evolve and change their shape but do not have a genetic sequence. For example, the shapes of consumer items, from toothbrushes to cars, are under continual shape evolution but no-one supposes they have genomes. The challenge of making inferences about the past evolution of shapes, and of making guesses about which shapes have recent ancestors in common, is well established. The standard approach to this challenge is to extract sets of numbers that describe the shapes of interest and to use these summary sets to make guesses about the past. This proposal takes a different approach. We aim to develop mathematical techniques that use the shapes themselves, rather than summaries of them, to make inferences about the past. This approach has some advantages: it uses more of the information that we have; it allows us to characterize the process that yields shape evolution; and it allows us to make guesses about the shapes of unseen ancestors (rather than guesses about a restricted set of their features).This proposal aims to advance the study of shape evolution by considering the evolution of mathematical functions. A functional phylogeny is akin to a genetic evolutionary tree where it is a mathematical function, rather than a genetic sequence, that changes through time. We will test our theory by: using computer generated data; performing `Spatial Chinese Whispers' experiments; and investigating how the pronunciation of words has evolved in Romance languages. Our `Spatial Chinese Whispers' experiments will involve the task of drawing curves, one after the other, so that small errors in copying yield a slow drift in curve shape. Our investigation of speech sound evolution first converts the sounds of modern speakers into shapes and then exploits the fact that we are confident about the evolutionary tree of Romance languages. Just as information about current genetic sequences allow us to make guesses about the sequences of past organisms, this approach might allow us to test hypotheses about the sounds of languages we can no longer hear.This work has relevance to those interested in designing shapes for the future, as well as those interested in past shapes. By understanding past shape evolution one can use this to generate reasonable shape transformations which might help in product design. This work aims to take sets of shapes and to make guesses about which is most related to which: this can be very useful in areas which have nothing to do with shape evolution. The ability to detect unusual or familiar shapes has relevance to numerous public and commercial challenges from spotting unusual vehicles to guessing the shapes of letters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to reconstruct evolutionary history for general data that comprise smooth functions or shapes, going beyond the use of summary statistics: treating the evolution of shape as the evolution of mathematical functions. {Modern} phylogenetic inference allows us to take genetic sequences from creatures that we observe today and construct evolutionary histories that inform us about their ancestors. We propose to develop statistical methods that allow inference of the evolution of curves and shapes rather than the evolution of symbolic strings. By analogy, one application is to look at shapes that we observe today and make statistical statements about their common ancestors. Further, methods for identifying structure in data are extremely widely used across our scientific and industrial endeavours. A very useful class of tools are those of unsupervised learning, which work on unsorted and unlabelled data. The work proposed can be viewed as extending existing methods for unsupervised learning to data which are shapes or functions. The method discussed here thus has an alternative interpretation as a new approach to the hierarchical clustering of shapes: the shapes are imagined to have evolved from common ancestors and a corresponding dendrogram is inferred. This dendrogram could expose the structure of the set of shapes by invoking a purely notional evolutionary history. Who will benefit from this research and how? As noted above, the algorithm can either a) be viewed as a tool for informing about the evolution of shapes or b) as a means of finding natural clusters of shape data. The audiences for these two uses are slightly different. a) Product designers might like to use information about the process of shape evolution in Nature to find ways of generating new designs (effectively running the algorithms we describe forward in time) or for investigating the evolution of designs in the past. Similarly, those working in museums and galleries who are interested in the evolution of artistic styles and forms might profit from algorithms of this kind. Handwriting and picture authenticity checking could potentially be assisted by work related to ours. b) Data mining tools have found varied uses, for example within industry, government and intelligence. The ability to assess which groups of shapes cluster together---be they speech recordings, body outlines or trajectories---is very useful. It might allow improved surveillance tools (by identifying threatening shapes or motions), better product recommendations (by relating a selected product to other similarly shaped items for purchase), or automated advice on pronunciation (relating new speech signals to existing stored signals). What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research? The algorithms that are produced, and the associated data, will be freely available from our webpages. We will consult with the intellectual property and consulting parts of our respective universities to ensure that possible commercial exploitation is considered. For each of the papers that we publish we will make two short video presentations. One will be designed to be accessed by the general public and the other by a more technical scientific audience. The major paper which unites the full algorithm with synthetic, experimental and real data will be circulated to the publicity offices of the EPSRC and our respective institutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Aeronautics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Colin Cotter joins the group</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F341F11-5459-4B52-8FFA-DCFE67D5CBCE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b965895cb965897a-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Colin Cotter is a world leader in Computational Geometry and Numerical Analysis.

John Moriarty and Nick Jones brought this research into schools by performing a public experiment in the Swinton High school and then making an associated video.

Outside the mutating messages frame work we also connected this grant engagement activities: Nick Jones gave a talk to students from three schools about becoming a mathematician and included an experiment within the talk about mutating sequences of symbols.

The High School teacher said that her students were enthused by participating in our experiments and loved the blog and video. These continue to receive hits.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1571216640.59461710bc91c8a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://mutatingmessages.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>16144</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Mutating Messages</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/I017615/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>058F4C7F-3839-4491-8833-9FEE2ECB5807</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5eda0dba5eda0dce</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A description of the impact of our work.

This work was attempting to develop a new direction of academic inquiry: how to reason probabilistically about our past shapes and functions. Given that it was a one year project we were successful in communicating our work to a large audience: we were able to publish our work in the most read journal in evolutionary studies (as well as developing the relevant technical details in another paper) and we organised two meetings at which world leaders in the study of the evolution of shapes and sounds were exposed to our work. We have also presented our work at a number of oher conferences and meetings and have been able to attract other talented researchers to join our team. Some feel for the local impact of the work can be seen in that the work was connected to at least four projects at masters and PhD level.



As mentioned elsewhere, our project opens up new avenues for design and new computational methods for automatic identification of plants and animals. Norman Macleod (Natural History Museum) who joined our team is very interested in how our evolutionary approach can be used to improve taxonomic identification. John Coleman (Oxford Phonetics) joined our team and is very excited in our work because of the possibility of allowing philology to have an aspect of speech and to offer the prospect of reconstructing past speech sounds. Colin Cotter (Imperial Phonetics) joined our team and is very interested in how our work might allow probabilistic extensions of the deterministic approaches currently used in shape morphing. This has implications for biomedical image analysis (registration and tracking shape change).

Contribution Method: The statistics of shapes and functions is a growth area: in our papers we defined and developed a new vista of problems. We think that our work puts the UK at the front of world efforts in the statistical study of object oriented data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EECE719F-75EF-4D1E-9030-C734E2828553</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-4430912513.687194de259bc8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this scoping project we set out to investigate an extension of the task of inferring the evolutionary trees that relate different creatures. This is typically done by using genetic sequences (strings of symbols) we wanted to extend this to the situation where each creature is described by a mathematical function. 

We approached this challenge by using an area of mathematics called Gaussian processes. We produced a technical paper explaining how they can be used and applying them to preliminary data. At the same time we organised two meetings which were designed to identify expertise in functional approaches to evolved data. We thus expanded our team to include experts from Computational Geometry, Phonetics, Linguistics and Animal Morphometrics. All of us then wrote a paper &amp;quot;Phylogenetic inference for function-valued traits: speech sound evolution&amp;quot; in the most widely read journal in Evolutionary studies. In this we argued that we have the right set of tools to be able to not only construct candidate evolutionary trees connecting speech sounds in different languages but also to put probability distributions over possible ancestral sounds.

We also considered 1) simple situations in which we could morph one sound into another 2) a unified view that reveals equivalences between a Gaussian process view and the idea that evolution mixes source functions. Our work was presented at a number of conferences, generated associated publications, and inspired several school engagement projects including a video. At its conclusion we had a clear framework in which to develop our ideas about speech sound, and shape, evolution and the team with which to make this progress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As noted above this work has relevance for applied taxonomy (identifying pests, weeds, rare species...) and for design. This was a scoping grant so the major way that this work will progress will be by finding follow-on funding. This will allow us to go beyond the proof of principle work that we have undertaken for functions and to extend our explorations to shapes.



Our work will be useful to allow us to reason probabilistically about unseen ancestral shapes and sounds. This will be relevant for linguistics, phonetics and the diverse uses of evolutionary biology. The idea that we might be able to hear the sound of dead languages is very appealing and small successes in this area would likely attract attention to the power of statistical approaches benefiting both linguistics/phonetics and mathematics and statistics. This work might lead to improvements in automated species identification - something which has substantial implications where-ever applied taxonomy is required.



We finally note that a way of inferring ancestral shapes and sounds also offers the prospect of being able to evolve a set of shapes and sounds forward in time: this could be a useful tool in design of products.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E89057F3-4EC5-447D-AC15-5533CC6B6517</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9863784834.615685775ff3c2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://functionalphylogenies.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48C74D0B-1BAF-4061-8ABB-CC19121070E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterizing fundamental frequency in Mandarin: a functional principal component approach utilizing mixed effect models.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d7b8e3ce17064b5f381cdfc8b0a0cc46"><gtr:id>d7b8e3ce17064b5f381cdfc8b0a0cc46</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hadjipantelis PZ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06e06ebbc70c6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B431EF70-6252-4463-92EF-3AA597D82992</gtr:id><gtr:title>Highly comparative time-series analysis: the empirical structure of time series and their methods.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bb02469cf4e61892430a5c20abb976ce"><gtr:id>bb02469cf4e61892430a5c20abb976ce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fulcher BD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5463d7896ac9d2.29011131</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D9C29903-C5E2-487C-9007-B4AAE434F026</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evolutionary Inference for Functional Data: Using Gaussian Processes on Phylogenies of Functional Data Objects</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ac0a7a24784fafc319a0fc3422ee4bfe"><gtr:id>ac0a7a24784fafc319a0fc3422ee4bfe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mhairi  Kerr (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_822161796963ec27ac</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FD47A880-A5B8-4B90-8CC5-722DA47BD178</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamical clustering of exchange rates</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quantitative Finance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e62f19f1c6d04b6e1881b5e37976236c"><gtr:id>e62f19f1c6d04b6e1881b5e37976236c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fenn D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f95e95ed0a7541</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0A86822A-2DEE-4118-9FB7-8404074CFD58</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evolutionary inference for function-valued traits: Gaussian process regression on phylogenies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the Royal Society, Interface</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b3a5167ade8ea93678221b95a4408e49"><gtr:id>b3a5167ade8ea93678221b95a4408e49</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones NS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1742-5662</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5463d05d227756.51592645</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>489BEDA7-0A0A-46F4-9DE8-C2A355BCB6F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phylogenetic inference for function-valued traits: speech sound evolution.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in ecology &amp; evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/440012c177d2b85ecea37f15f5374e98"><gtr:id>440012c177d2b85ecea37f15f5374e98</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Functional Phylogenies Group</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0169-5347</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d00e00e0fdc911</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D221CA0-D956-4F23-B52F-E5D91B61B762</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generalized methods and solvers for noise removal from piecewise constant signals.
