is to identify molecular factors that enable avian influenza (AI) viruses to establish and cause sustained infections in poultry. This project will take forward our recent studies on evolution, adaption and transmission of AI viruses mainly focusing on the analysis of the diversity of AI viruses affecting poultry and identification of genetic correlates that facilitate the sustained infection in chickens and turkeys through gaining greater transmissibility and virulence. The identified evolutionary and host-specific adaptive changes will be used to construct mutant AI viruses and their potential effects on host tropism, infectivity, replication, transmission and virulence will be assessed in different host-origin tissue culture systems and animal models including chickens, turkeys and ducks. These studies will provide foundation for the improvement of avian influenza virus control strategies by developing new advanced efficacious vaccines and highly effective diagnostic tools enabling to minimise their impact on animals, public health and world economy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2085931</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MSk Lab</gtr:department><gtr:description>Understanding diversity of avian influenza viruses and improvement disease control in poultry and humans</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F73425C-4E13-4138-A060-42A0FB001EB6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ultimate aims of this collaboration are to reduce the impact of influenza virus on poultry production and reduce their zoonotic transmission to humans.
