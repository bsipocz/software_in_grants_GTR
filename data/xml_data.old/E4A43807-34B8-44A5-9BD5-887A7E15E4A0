Whilst also developing a complementary systems-level perspective exploring the potential roles of social enterprises in the eGovernment in the medium to long-term. Each of these intertwined strands of research are described further below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To explore the role of social enterprises in eGovernment Services comparative case studies will be developed. These case studies will be interrogated by applying an established impact evaluation framework. A combination of methods will be used to undertake this investigation including existing knowledge and data based upon:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>previous research&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>surveys&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>focus groups&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Possible long-term pathways for the role of social enterprises in eGovernment services will also be developed. Seeking to address questions including:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to what extent, and how, can different actors influence pathways?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what might be the key technological, organisational and institutional changes involved in each pathway?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Interviews and focus groups with eGovernment practitioners (from across the public, private and third sector) will be employed as appropriate at each stage of the research.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the UK, the re-framing and reforming of the public domain is cutting across organisational and sectoral boundaries. In particular, the increased contribution of Third Sector organisations to government service delivery is both an opportunity and a threat. Investigating the potential value in this space is a central part of this research project, that's fits with public policy imperatives of creating new types of local enterprise and employment. Hence, the potential beneficiaries in respect of impact of this research proposal are varied and include: 
* The Charity Commission Charities, social enterprises and other Third Sector organisations;
* Central and local government departments, quasi-governmental agencies at different geographical scales, for example Local Economic Partnerships (LEPs) and other forms of strategic partnerships;
* Private sector companies engaged in social economy development activities, including social computing, community development and local re-generation;
* Learned societies and groups, including social media ones that combine academic, policy and practitioner communities.

This proposal seeks to benefit the range of potential beneficiaries outlined above by enhancing the following capabilities. 
* The ability of decision makers in government (central and local) to design and implement eGovernment services that leverage the capabilities of social enterprises to reduce social exclusion.
* The ability of decision makers in government (central and local) to act with an awareness of the potential long term pathways for eGovernment and the potential long term implications of their decisions.
* The ability of social enterprises to identify and realise opportunities to play a key role in the delivery of eGovernment services.
* The ability of the complex network of public, private and third sector actors involved in eGovernment service delivery to adapt to technological, institutional, user and economic change.

A key focus of the research was an in-depth case study of the development of Freegle - a social economy organisation providing an online platform for waste reduction and prevention - over a five year period. The finding of this case study have helped to inform and support Freegle in developing funding bids, which if successful will increase the impact of Freegle across the UK.

The research focussed on Freegle was also reported in the Conversation (http://theconversation.com/why-the-sharing-economy-needs-a-democratic-revolution-46788). In this article insights from the Freegle case study for the growing debate over the impacts and nature of the sharing economy were highlighted. In particular, the article notes that the rapidly growing influence of Silicon Valley owners over sharing economy platforms is a troubling development. The growing strength and pervasiveness of these platforms means their owners have significant power to impose their visions of what it means to be a citizen or worker in cities across the globe. Hence, Freegle's unique model of democratic platform governance offer a glimpse of the potential for a fairer, more participative sharing economy.

The research also analysed the rapidly emerging sharing economy discourse, identifying key conflicts between policy-makers, entrepreneurs, incumbent business and social movement organisations. This analysis underpinned a blog I wrote in response to Paul Mason's (a prominent economic journalist) claims about the sharing economy. The blog was published by the World Economic Forum (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/08/how-the-sharing-economy-could-develop/). The academic paper reporting this research has also been prominently cited in the review of the sharing economy literature conducted for EC policy-makers by the Joint Research Centre (http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101279/jrc101279.pdf).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>30E137B4-4308-4DEA-9777-3050C8C90FCF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>542148ec831fb8.11800494</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Achievement 1: The research conducted highlighted both the promise and perils of social economy organisations delivering online services to citizens. The in-depth research case study focussed on the development of Freegle - a social economy organisation providing an online waste reduction and prevention service - over a five year period. This research highlighted that the promise of such social economy organisations, within a wider ecosystem of eGovernment, centres on their ability to: combine the logics of commerce, social enterprise and the grassroots (i.e. supporting hybrid organisational forms); build social capital; and, deliver services at a national scale. Such organisations also face considerable challenges in the form of pressures to become more business-like, which in turn erode their distinctive and hybrid characteristics. Furthermore, the process of becoming more business-like is hugely time consuming and can detract from the delivery of online services to citizens.
Achievement 2: The research conducted also applied socio-technical transitions theory to a new empirical domain, to develop better understanding of the process of digital innovation within government. In particular, the research focused on the barriers faced by the Open Government Data (OGD) agenda; a high profile innovation in digital governance. The findings of the research emphasised that: barriers to the breakthrough of the OGD agenda are perceived to be widespread and related to both social and technological factors; barriers relating to the demand for and use of OGD are perceived as prevalent; the structures of government and macro-scale institutions are perceived to act as barriers; and, barriers to mobilizing cultural and financial resources are widely perceived. Furthermore, the novel application of socio-technical transitions opened up new digital governance research questions including: how can social economy and citizen use of government data and digital services be increased? Could a strategic approach to fostering social economy and citizen engagement in digital governance innovation transform public service design and delivery? What role might digital innovation in government play in the transition to a more sustainable and equitable society?

Achievement 3: The primary objective of the Management and Business Development Fellowship grant award was to enable the Principle Investigator (PI) to make the transition from a background in computer science research to become an established researcher in the field of management and business. Over the course of the grant, thanks to the support and active engagement of mentors within the Open University Business School, the PI has developed a broad range of quantitative and qualitative research skills and expertise spanning business model design, social enterprise, eGovernment, public sector innovation and neo-institutionalism. The PI is now an established academic working at the interface between sustainability, the digital economy and digital government; reflected in a growing portfolio of academic publications and impact activities. Furthermore, based upon this portfolio he has secured a Research Associate position at the University of Manchester, following on from the MBD fellowship, where his research will focus on smart city business models and he will continue his professional development as a management science scholar.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings of the research might be taken forward by various digital innovation practitioners across the public sector and social economy. In particular, I suggest that a strategic approach to fostering social economy and civil society engagement in eGovernment and digital governance is needed to overcome the wide-range of innovation barriers identified. In the case of OGD, as exemplar of innovation in digital governance, this would require increasing investment in the initiatives promoting user engagement across the public and private sectors and civil society (as investment to date has focused on the supply side). This in turn could foster the social learning required to explore and then overcome barriers relating to user practice. Whilst, within the academic community the key research findings might be taken forward in the form of further research: seeking to establish theoretical frameworks for the study of digital innovations span the public sector, and market and social economies; forging productive connections between the study of OGD and science and technology studies; and, developing understanding of the extent to which social economy organisations are participating in the processes of digital governance.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F68BCA1C-36DA-485A-A14D-7B936431F041</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>542149065d8b70.30654157</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inclusion of publication from project as a core reading on a module at Oxford University (Transformation towards Sustainability: Sharing Economy as the Lens)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A546988-AD03-4C34-B960-F3B7C5AA8B21</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ac189e353039.56997821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/msc/downloads/2016-17ElectiveHandbook.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in EC JRC Science for Policy Report on the Sharing Economy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E79C26D-C05B-435C-B00E-6AFFFF973BE5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ac1502a981b7.32790406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers2.cfm?abstract_id=2793901</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in systematic review of the grassroots innovation literature</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DED8F54A-FD44-469D-A3BD-C4D004B3B40C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ac164f76a027.50209177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616310368</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>971CFE5E-1EB4-4902-8CBD-731444965624</gtr:id><gtr:title>Commercial orientation in grassroots social innovation: Insights from the sharing economy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06"><gtr:id>5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>561258851698f7.77208012</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B29C4B66-D716-48A7-BCDF-5EC12C06381F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The sharing economy: A pathway to sustainability or a nightmarish form of neoliberal capitalism?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06"><gtr:id>5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c1e48c2c3589.03050902</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD38511C-0B71-4896-8F14-B71C44689F14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Democratising platform governance in the sharing economy: An analytical framework and initial empirical insights</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cleaner Production</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06"><gtr:id>5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcad8374079.42567322</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>74A9AAFB-0621-4BBD-9AA6-D312EF8A410B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Grassroots social innovation and the mobilisation of values in collaborative consumption: a conceptual model</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Cleaner Production</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06"><gtr:id>5292dfe7dacdc3f4f68dd2c4085a1b06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d64bfdda368.86102328</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7CBBA2CD-F461-434E-A60A-69ADA1222864</gtr:id><gtr:title>Barriers to the Open Government Data Agenda: Taking a Multi-Level Perspective</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Policy &amp;
