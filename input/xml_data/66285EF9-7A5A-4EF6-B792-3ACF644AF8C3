sequencing technologies</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I002480/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Fasciolosis is a common and important disease of livestock. In the UK it is the most commonly reported infection associated with the digestive tract of ruminants. It is caused by Fasciola hepatica, a flatworm found in the liver and transmitted by a mud snail. Fasciolosis is controlled predominantly using drug treatment and the most commonly used drug is triclabendazole (TCBZ). This is the only drug that is effective against the immature stages of the parasite that are responsible for acute, often fatal disease. It is also the drug of choice for human fasciolosis, caused by the same parasite. Resistance to TCBZ was first reported in Australia in 1995 and is now thought to be widespread worldwide. Very little is known about mechanisms of drug resistance in F. hepatica, which genes are involved and how resistance is evolving. This proposal aims to exploit our ability to create clones of resistant and susceptible F. hepatica; to derive genetically identical infections of TCBZ-susceptible and TCBZ-resistant isolates in sheep, from which we will generate second generation populations. These populations will be used to identify markers, in this case single mutations at the DNA level that associate with resistance genes during the crossing of resistant and susceptible clones. We will use rapid, high throughput, next generation sequencing technologies, which allow us to produce a preliminary F. hepatica genome map. The resistance markers will be mapped onto this preliminary genome and allow us to identify regions of the genome where the gene or genes responsible for encoding resistance are found. At the end of the project we will have genetic markers for resistance that could be used to detect and track the emergence of resistance in populations of F. hepatica in naturally infected sheep and cattle in the UK, but, importantly they will also be used in future projects to start to home in and identify genes encoding resistance. There will be other important outputs for the wider scientific community from the project, such as a bank of genome data for the parasite and clones of the parasite whose resistance status is well characterised. Genome data will be made available through a publicly accessible website and the parasite clones will be made available to other groups by lodging them with our industrial partner, Ridgeways Research Ltd.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Fasciola hepatica causes serious disease in livestock worldwide. It is common in the UK, its prevalence is increasing and the costs of controlling infection have a significant impact on the UK agricultural sector. Resistance to triclabendazole (TCBZ), the most widely used drug for the control of fasciolosis, is reported in the UK, Europe and Australia. This project will take a new approach to identifying markers for resistance that will, in the long term, be useful in the identification of gene(s) encoding resistance and the development of assays to measure the prevalence and spread of resistance. Clonal lines will be generated from resistant and susceptible field isolates and F1 and F2 generations created based on crosses of these lines. A draft genome sequence for F. hepatica will be created using 454 fragment and mate pair libraries at 10x coverage producing a rough assembly (N50 of 30kb) complemented by Solexa reads and the MAKER pipeline used for basic annotation. Resistant and susceptible clonal lines will be resequenced at 20x coverage to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using SOLiD fragment libraries. Differences in SNP allele frequencies will be identified between parasites that have developed after exposure to TCBZ versus unexposed controls. Six pairs of treated vs control populations will be sequenced at 20x coverage using SOLiD fragment libraries. Allele frequencies will be analyzed using logistic regression plotted against the draft genome sequence to identify genomic regions associated with TCBZ resistance. Finally a sample of 150 SNPs linked to TCBZ resistance, plus 100 unlinked controls will be validated. Individual miracidia will be SNP genotyped to determine linkage between markers to indicate if a single locus is responsible for resistance and if TCBZ resistance is a dominant or recessive trait. Finally experimental infections using F2 individuals will be used to confirm linkage of SNPs to TCBZ resistance in vivo.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work we are proposing uses the latest genomic technologies combined with knowledge and exploitation of the life cycle of the parasite to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of triclabendazole resistance. The innovative nature of the work is only possible because of the recent advances in genome sequencing, but the work is necessarily technically complex and long term. In the short term the outputs of the project will be the identification of markers for resistance genes. This will lead to further research aimed at identifying specific genes of interest using the parasite material generated in this project, which, combined with the likely advances in sequencing and annotation technologies, will lead to identification of genes encoding resistance. From this we can start to understand the biochemical pathways associated with resistance, leading to ways to prevent resistance occurring - such as through modifications to the drug itself. Thus the tangible outputs and impact of the project are necessarily long term, but will ultimately lead to improved application of drug, markers for resistance and circumventing resistance mechanisms developed by the parasite. Markers for resistance will form the basis of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for resistance in the field and ultimately provide evidence based recommendations for anthelmintic use. The principle, immediate beneficiaries from this work is the scientific community in general and specifically groups working on anthelmintic resistance. The new approach we are taking will provide information to groups working on related systems. The majority of molecular studies on anthelmintic resistance have focused on possible associations of putative candidate genes with a resistance phenotype. What we are proposing represents a timely and novel molecular approach using a combination of genetic and genomic resources to address drug resistance at a genome-wide level. As such, the work will have important outputs, useful to other academics, both those working directly in fluke research but also those working on other parasites and in the drug resistance field as a whole. Those groups working on the development of vaccines, the immunology and pathogenesis of fluke and improved diagnosis will benefit from free access to the partly annotated fluke genome. Fluke research will be greatly advance by having access to new, fully validated parasite clones. These will be made available through our commercial collaborator, Ridgeways Research Ltd. In the long term, veterinarians, farmers and food retailers will benefit from diagnostics for triclabendazole resistance, improved, strategic use of triclabendazole leading to reduced use of drug, which ultimately will lead to reduced drug residues in food and improve the safety of meat and milk products for the whole community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>559821</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Santiago de Compostela</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Microbiology and Parasitology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Genotyping liver fluke from Argentina in collaboration with Severo Vazquez Prieto, Spain</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD62BB59-66CC-4EFB-BEC2-A291756F83CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Manuscript in preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67d7ecd3023.07355042-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collection of material

The exhibition was free and open to all and our pictures were displayed alongside more traditional artwork, therefore we were able to target a completely different demographic. The exhibition was particularly popular with young adults from a non-scientific background, and we even made cakes with our images printed on in icing.

Now that the exhibition has come to an end, the aim is to use this artwork within the Farm Animal areas at our Veterinary Field Station to help engage with farmers.

This has been used by a number of internationally-recognised research groups to identify genes that are candidate drug resistance genes, novel anthelmintic targets and vaccine candidates. We were approached by several research groups requesting access to our genome draft at an early point in the project. We provided access to an advanced draft to a number of groups and it substantially improved their ability to explore their gene families of interest. This led to a number of collaborative projects that are currently ongoing.

Genetically defined clonal isolates of known triclabendazole sensitivity:
These isolates have ensured that in vitro assays for drug sensitivity could be validated and used to phenotype populations of parasites ex vivo. They have also been used to explore the reproductive behaviour of F. hepatica in vivo.

Added value:
Our panel of microsatellites generated have been applied to address the question of population structure in F. hepatica. This is the basis of an University of Liverpool/EU funded PhD student project. PhD submitted February 2016.

Improving Diagnostics
Complementary field studies identifying TCBZ-resistant F. hepatica populations have been carried out by a Malaysian Government-funded PhD student in our laboratory. She has validated diagnostic tools using archived faecal and serum samples from sheep experimentally infected with F. hepatica during the course of this project. PhD successfully awarded August 2015.

We have received funding from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) Beef and Lamb for a studentship. The project uses our genome dataset and archived sera from our experimentally infected animals to develop a diagnostic to detect acute infection with F. hepatica.

We have a BBSRC DTP studentship that has been shortlisted and we have identified a high quality candidate for the project who is going to go forward to the final selection process. The project will explore the role of the snail intermediate host in the transmission of parasite genotypes and the potential for aggregation and long-term survival of metacercariae on pasture and in animal fodder. It is a CASE award with the AHDB Beef and Lamb industrial partner.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CF6C1CF5-2D7D-4B67-B642-FA68DAFBC3D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546383067e0f42.87855952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Fasciolosis is a common and important disease of livestock in the UK. It has substantially increased in prevalence over the last decade and poses a great threat to livestock health and welfare. It is caused by the parasite Fasciola hepatica, a flatworm found in the liver and transmitted by a mud snail. Fasciolosis is controlled predominantly using drug treatment and the most commonly used drug is triclabendazole (TCBZ). This is the only drug that is effective against the immature stages of the parasite that are responsible for acute, often fatal disease. It is also the drug of choice for human fasciolosis, caused by the same parasite. Resistance to TCBZ was first reported in Australia in 1995 and is now thought to be widespread worldwide. Very little is known about the mechanisms of drug resistance in F. hepatica, which genes are involved and how resistance develops and spreads.
This proposal has exploited our ability to manipulate the parasite life cycle to create clones of resistant and susceptible F. hepatica; to derive infections of genetically identical TCBZ-susceptible and TCBZ-resistant isolates in sheep, from which we produced second generation populations. These populations were used to identify markers in the genome of F. hepatica that associate with resistance.

Our major findings are:

1) The first ever draft genome for Fasciola hepatica and production of a panel of markers throughout the genome, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, that allow us to identify large sections of the genome.

2) Production and maintenance of six clonal isolates of triclabendazole-susceptible (TCBZ-S; n=3) and -resistant (TCBZ-R; n=3) isolates of F. heptica (each one derived from a from a single parasite).

3) By taking a clonal TCBZ-S parasite and allowing it to mate with a TCBZ-R F. hepatica parasite we have produced offspring, F2 recombinants, that have both TCBZ-resistance and -susceptibilty genes. These F2 offspring were treated with the drug TCBZ and only a proportion of parasites survived treatment. For the first time this shows that TCBZ resistance has a genetic basis and is heritable.
4. By comparing the frequency of genome-wide SNP markers in surviving parasites (TCBZ-resistant) to the same population in control (non-drug treated) samples (both TCBZ-resistant and susceptible) using a pooled genotyping approach we have localised regions of the genome associated with TCBZ resistance. 

5. We have determined that Fasciola hepatica in the UK are diploid and exist as a panmictic (random mingling and mating when breeding) population, exhibiting high gene flow (transfer of genes from one generation to another). This suggests that once present resistance genes can move rapidly through liver fluke populations and even animals that are not frequently exposed to drug treatment can harbour resistant parasites.

6. We have shown that the snail intermediate host is capable of being infected with more than one genotype of F. hepatica and that may explain the high levels of diversity we see in the definitive host. This is preliminary work but in future it will help us understand the role of the snail in the transmission of drug resistant parasites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The genome dataset was in much demand from the international research field and was made available as an advanced draft in 20013 for six research laboratories worldwide and one industry partner.

The clonal isolates generated during this project have been shared with three other research groups and are publically available from our laboratories.

The candidate genes we are associating with TCBZ resistance will be of interest to a number of laboratories worldwide.

The panel of microsatellite and genome-wide SNPs we have generated are in use by our laboratory and will be useful to other researchers worldwide in order to better understand F. hepatica population structure, transmission dynamics and the influence of drug selection.

Metacercariae are vital to perform in vitro and in vivo studies of F. hepatica, to advance our knowledge of new drugs, vaccines and to mitigate against drug rapid resistance development. They are in short supply and there is a global demand for metacercariae that cannot be met currently. We have submitted a BBSRC BBR to draw on our substantial expertise to deliver an integrated biological and bioinformatic resource to the liver fluke research community. This application was recognised as exceptional by reviewers and is currently under consideration by BBSRC committee. If successful this will deliver a global resource as a direct result of the work completed within BB/1002480/1.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D9F243F3-98CE-4979-9A17-C2129BB93959</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462381a986bb8.25885637</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.liverpool.ac.uk/liver-fluke</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Advanced drafts of the F. hepatica genome were made available to a number of researchers throughout the lifetime of the project.

The dataset was made publically available in 2014 via the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK. The Fasciola hepatica genome is available from the European Nucleotide Archive under accession numbers PRJEB6687 (read data) and ERZ021912 (assembly). The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the world's nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation.

Other associated files are available from the Centre for Genomic Research server (http://www.cgr.liv.ac.uk:8088/illum/Fasciolav2_db1af35899c4eb29/) and will soon be made available as part of the BBSRC-funded parasite-WormBase portal from EBI/Sanger Institute.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5197EDAB-4158-4FEB-89F4-69F8E67874A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cwiklinski, K., Dalton, J.
