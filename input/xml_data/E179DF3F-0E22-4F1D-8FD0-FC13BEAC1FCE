In addition to hydrogen removal, for reactions where catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition is an issue, the continuous and distributed supply of oxygen to provide in situ catalyst regeneration would be highly beneficial. Ceramic membranes that exhibit protonic, oxygen ion and electronic conductivity are ideally suited for such applications and would find use in processes such as methane steam reforming, methane coupling and aromatisation to name but a few. In this project we will investigate the development of high temperature ceramic hydrogen and oxygen transport membranes to be used in membrane-based methane aromatisation with combined catalyst regeneration. The employed membranes must be both mechanically and chemically stable at the required temperature of operation and reaction conditions, providing high selectivity towards hydrogen permeation with concomitant high hydrogen fluxes. 
Despite the huge potential methane presents as a feedstock material for chemical synthesis, to date the most widespread use of methane is as a fuel, while its use as a chemical feedstock is mainly limited to methane reforming for the production of synthesis gas and hydrogen (methane reforming is the most mature technology to date for the production of hydrogen). In addition, natural gas is still wastefully flared resulting in unnecessary greenhouse emissions with a concomitant resource waste. At UK-based oil platforms emissions due to natural gas flaring amount to 2.9 million cubic meters per day- equivalent to approximately 3% of the yearly total UK gas gas production. It has been noted that the largest amount of gas flared in association with oil production is a direct result of the lack of infrastructure for its utilisation. Therefore, the development of a viable process for utilisation of methane (as the main constituent of natural gas) will be of great benefit, in particular with meeting the UK Government's target of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050. The proposed project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a membrane-based methane aromatisation process with significant benefits for the research community and the oil and gas industry both in the participating countries and worldwide. This project links together several aspects of materials science and chemical engineering e.g. membrane stability under real operating conditions and optimisation of a catalytic process of industrial interest, while working towards a practical solution of the very interesting problem of methane utilisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>With respect to the potential socio-economic impact of the proposed project we have identified three groups of beneficiaries classed according to the immediacy of the benefits received as a result of the project. The mechanisms in place to achieve the desired impact outcomes will be discussed in the 'Pathways to Impact' section
1. Immediate to short-term benefits (&amp;lt; 5years): Researchers involved in the project and chemical engineering undergraduate students at the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at QUB. 
The most immediate beneficiaries of the proposed project have been identified as the researcher directly involved in the work. The PDRA will work in a research environment in a Russell Group University, while working on a cutting edge research project. He/she will become competent in a wide range of analytical, experimental and modelling techniques thus improving significantly their employability at the end of his PhD. In addition, he/she will develop new skills both in terms of research and personal development. The PDRA will be encouraged to participate in international conferences and attend training workshops both with respect to their research but also as part of their personal development. 
In addition, undergraduate students in chemical engineering will benefit from this work. It is envisaged that at least four final year MEng and BEng students will conduct their final year research project in areas relevant to this project under the supervision of the PI. These students will be exposed to the working ethos of a research project and will gain valuable experience for their future career. The findings from this work will also be incorporated into the undergraduate teaching, where relevant, in particular in the final two year of. 
2. Medium term benefits (5-15 years): Companies involved in the oil and gas, ceramic materials and separation process industries.
For the 5-15 year period after the completion of the project the potential beneficiaries have been identified as companies active in the oil and gas, ceramic materials, and separations sectors both in the UK and globally. Examples include companies such as BP, Perenco, Praxair and Air Products will be recipients of such technology. Companies active in the oil and gas industry will benefit from the delivery of a final product/solution for membrane-based methane activation to be used either as a direct route for methane exploitation (with the view to steer away from synthesis routes based on oil derivatives) or as an alternative route to natural gas flaring at oil platforms and terminals. Companies that are active in the areas of functional ceramics and gas phase separations will benefit from the intermediate steps of the project, namely material development. The developed materials will be relevant to a multitude of additional applications such a hydrogen purification, solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers.
3. Long term benefits (&amp;gt;15 years): The UK economy and public
In the long term the UK economy and public stand to benefit from the technology developed in this project. Successful implementation of this technology will see the reduction of CO2 emissions from unnecessary flaring at oil and gas terminals and platforms, thus improving the air quality and aiding the UK government to achieve their target of 80% CO2 emissions reduction by 2050. In fact this project and any follow on work comes at a crucial point in the timeline of measures required to achieve this reduction target. Reduction of CO2 emissions will also lead to further potential economic benefits for the UK public, as it will become possible for the government to sell redundant CO2 credits to emerging economies, thus enabling economic growth that will improve the quality of life for the British public. Moreover, the technology developed here can put the UK in a lead position in the global oil and gas market as the IP holder.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99370</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tianjin University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Tianjin Technical University</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E83E452-32BE-46EA-A824-B067C5BA88F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PDRA visit arranged</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b88ab1eae0.07138958-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration set up as part of the project.
