Several neurological and psychiatric disorders may be caused by a breakdown of the ability of these regions to communicate effectively. While several different methods have been developed to understand how the component regions, or nodes, of a network interact, there is no comprehensive framework for combining the information from different techniques to give an overall picture of network function. Without such a framework, advances in neuroimaging techniques which allow the characterisation of anatomical and functional connections cannot be fully exploited. The purpose of this project is to develop such a framework, making use of intrinsic brain activity which can define well characterised model networks, thereby providing a natural validation of the results.
 The nodes of brain networks can be identified using three different definitions of connectivity between regions. Structural connectivity (SC) describes the anatomical connections between regions, functional connectivity (FC) identifies whether the activity of two regions increases and decreases coherently, while effective connectivity (EC) attempts to describe the brain not in terms of EEG or MRI signals, but the underlying neuronal populations which produce them. Each of these measures can be estimated using multiple different data acquisition and analysis techniques. For example, SC can be determined from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI scans, which are sensitive to the diffusion of water in white matter tracts, or from measurements of cortical thickness. Similarly, FC can be calculated from electroencephalography (EEG) or functional MRI (fMRI) measurements. Understanding how these different measures of connectivity are related, and how measurements of human brain function and structure can be combined to produce a unified picture, is not straightforward. Few studies have acquired the high quality data with multiple techniques that is required for such an undertaking. A further complication is that of defining model networks which are of sufficient complexity to provide a realistic test of any methodological developments, while being sufficiently well-characterised to allow developments to be validated. We will overcome this issue in a novel way by building on decades of invasive neurophysiological experiments which have characterised the networks responsible for the generation of thalamocortical oscillations (TCO), electrophysiological events that are generated by interactions between cortical and thalamic network nodes. TCO can be hallmarks of normal brain function (alpha rhythm, sleep spindles and K-complexes), or pathophysiology, of which the most obvious are generalised spike-wave discharges, characteristic of generalised epilepsy. 
 This project will use the networks defined by TCO to investigate the relationships between different measures of brain connectivity, developing and optimising new methods to combine and fully exploit all of the information that can be extracted from non-invasive brain imaging data. Modelling and analysis of these networks will be based on graph theoretical approaches. By using these restricted and well-characterised model networks, we will be able to validate our work against previous neurophysiological data, and provide general tools for the neuroimaging community. In addition, we will shed light on the generation of normal and pathological brain activity and how this arises from network connectivity patterns.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term the primary beneficiaries of this research will be academic, since the project will lead to better tools for using neuroimaging methods to characterise the brain. In addition, it will feed back to the field of communications and computer networks engineering, to provide new information regarding the way in which the human brain solves issues of structural and functional connectivity. Such information can inspire the creation of new engineering approaches on routing and network connectivity in distributed networking solutions. However, once these tools have been developed, the scope of their potential application will be considerable and relate to any number of questions in sensory, cognitive or clinical neuroscience. To take an example from an area with which the applicants are familiar, focal epilepsy has traditionally been considered as resulting from a discrete, localised, generally cortical abnormality. However, recent work has suggested that even a focal epilepsy is a result of network dysfunction, and that the brain regions responsible for an ostensibly cortical focal epilepsy can in fact be much more widely distributed, both cortically and subcortically, than previously believed. Such hypotheses are supported by the observation that even in patients who have undergone successful epilepsy surgery there can be a recurrence of seizures after an absence of several years, a phenomenon attributed to continued epileptic activity in the remaining network nodes. Other brain disorders such as those of sleep, autism and schizophrenia have also been proposed to originate from disrupted networks. What is needed to confirm these hypotheses about brain function are the methods which can characterise distributed networks at the whole brain level, synthesising the information available from structural and functional imaging into a coherent whole. These are the goals of the current project. As such, future beneficiaries of this project will be patients with brain disorders, and the clinicians treating them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>588306</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Sir Peter Mansfield Centre</gtr:description><gtr:id>984F7C4B-10A9-4E7C-85BC-29B460DF05FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Award from the Birmingham-Nottingham Strategic Collaboration Fund.

In our initial methodological publications, we investigated the robustness of analysis techniques from communications engineering when applied to brain imaging data, the relationship between brain structure and function, introduced and validated a technique to investigate how brain regions interact dynamically, and examined methods to identify sub-regions of a brain structure that is crucial for sleep regulation and waking information processing, the thalamus. We were able to show that by examining brain connectivity dynamically information could be extracted about brain network interactions in the descent into sleep. We expanded upon this issue and used these techniques to explicitly look at the effect of sleep on the thalamus, and how it is internally and externally connected. We were able to demonstrates the complexity and state-specific nature of functional thalamic relationships over the sleep-wake cycle, and highlight the importance of a thalamocortical focus in the study of sleep mechanisms. We have applied similar methods to the study of epilepsy, specifically examining how the thalamus is affected by sleep in people with generalised epilepsy compared to control subjects, as well as looking more widely at brain connectivity in sleep. We were also able to demonstrate that the amount of sleep a participant had accumulated over the past two weeks was predictive of their brain connectivity, with the effects specific to the frontal regions of the brain. This is important as complex cognitive processes that require the frontal lobe are the most affected by sleep deprivation, and our observations start to provide a mechanistic explanation of this behavioural observation. In a review article we outlined theoretical and practical issues related to the use of human brain imaging data to understand alterations to consciousness that arise as a result of the descent into sleep, and epileptic seizures. This project has allowed us to develop strong collaborations with the University of Nottingham, and specifically a pending EPSRC application that will develop improved techniques for investigating the thalamus. It has also generated a collaboration with UNICAMP in Brazil, working on the use of analytic techniques to understand the brain changes that occur in generalised epilepsy. Both of these collaborations have resulted in successful internal funding applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Results and the conceptual framework have been presented at a number of conferences and workshops attended by researchers and clinicians, as well as the workshop that we organised. A particularly important aspect is the potential for applying the techniques we are working on in clinical practice, and to facilitate this we are highlighting our work to clinical colleagues at every opportunity. The workshop we organised had a combined focus on methodological issues and applications, with a range of speakers who talked about diverse topics ranging from network models to epilepsy and schizophrenia. It was well attended, feedback was positive and there was a good dialogue between basic scientists and clinicians. One aspect that became clear as we developed our work was the need for better methods to characterise the thalamus, a crucial brain structure in health and a wide variety of brain disorders. While we have published our approach based on patterns of functional connectivity, and applied it the investigation of sleep and epilepsy, more work is needed. This has lead to an expansion of our collaborations with the University of Nottingham and UNICAMP, and we are in the process of developing an application to develop new tools for segmenting the thalamus, working closely with neurosurgeons at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Queens Medical Centre Nottingham where deep brain stimulation is undertaken. These interactions and the findings of the current project allow us to move forward in developing better clinical tools and applying our approaches clinically.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABD3DC86-EAF2-4D19-A7DE-8352372A009D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5444ccbc4537c0.43325452</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF925CCB-D13B-494F-B4A1-856D6078F2C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic spatiotemporal variability of alpha-BOLD relationships during the resting-state and task-evoked responses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NeuroImage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ab5f7a2f2226b7a2ecec9dc849ba674b"><gtr:id>ab5f7a2f2226b7a2ecec9dc849ba674b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mayhew SD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-8119</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fec4a01f4c3.69218120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76CCBDCD-ACDE-4BBA-ADC5-3180E908667B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thalamic functional connectivity and its association with behavioral performance in older age</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Brain and Behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/733308badf8106f8d4c688633169bd68"><gtr:id>733308badf8106f8d4c688633169bd68</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goldstone A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b3a044078.64351331</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC98DFA0-0746-4CC5-A58D-827DDF1CEF9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influence of epoch length on measurement of dynamic functional connectivity in wakefulness and behavioural validation in sleep.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NeuroImage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0489f4c69b40395787202465de369dbf"><gtr:id>0489f4c69b40395787202465de369dbf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilson RS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-8119</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55faa0aa0bc321e0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>90B9E321-713B-4A0D-9F22-93E3A854B4B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Habitual sleep durations and subjective sleep quality predict white matter differences in the human brain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurobiology of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5cf7bfc034be2af1349ea722cf2d6da1"><gtr:id>5cf7bfc034be2af1349ea722cf2d6da1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khalsa S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a738f1dbe1543.32960362</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63CB23DD-0533-4255-8593-4DC712F52AFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gender Specific Re-organization of Resting-State Networks in Older Age.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in aging neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/733308badf8106f8d4c688633169bd68"><gtr:id>733308badf8106f8d4c688633169bd68</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goldstone A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1663-4365</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5892fafee33ff0.00047967</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5E2EF38-8D22-4CD4-AECD-EA391B2067CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multimodal neuroimaging investigations of alterations to consciousness: the relationship between absence epilepsy and sleep.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Epilepsy &amp;
