The objective(s) is to find promising valorization routes and markets for fruit and cereal processing by-products.
NAMASTE-EU will focus on citrus pulp and wheat bran processing and will develop and assess laboratory-scale experimental protocols to convert by-products into novel foods and ingredients with improved nutritional properties. The experimental approach will develop existing expertise and technologies within the EU partnership. IFR will co-ordinate the NAMASTE-EU research on ?Natural ingredients for new foods: pre-treatment of by-products, recovery and production of natural molecules? and at IFR the focus will be on wheat bran. 
NAMASTE-India will adopt complementary/synergic strategies, technologies and processes to convert by-products of mango/pomegranate processing and rice bran into similar novel ingredients, foods and feeds. A proactive EU-India cooperation effort will be adopted to enhance mutual benefits, in terms of both knowledge generation and market expansion for the global food &amp;amp; drink industry.
NAMASTE joint consortia will strictly collaborate on common by-products and shared food technologies and on activities aimed at the nutritional quality, chemical and microbial safety of the resulting foods/feeds and the environmental benefits and economic opportunities associated with industrial exploitation. The direct involvement of strongly committed EU and Indian industries (and of an external Industrial Platform) will provide the high added value of guaranteeing the validation of developed processes and products, thus ensuring fast and effective industrial uptake.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research has not yet been exploited commercially.

The IFR component of this research programme focused on the exploitation of wheat bran. The bran was provided by a UK milling company. By-products generated every year by the European fruit and cereal processing industry currently exceed several million tons. They are disposed of mainly through landfills and thus are largely unexploited
sources of several valuable biobased compounds potentially profitable in the formulation of novel food products. The opportunity to design novel strategies to turn them into added value products and food ingredients via novel and sustainable processes is the main target of recently EC-funded FP7 project
NAMASTE-EU. NAMASTE-EU aims at developing new aboratory-scale protocols and processes for the exploitation of citrus processing by-products and wheat bran surpluses via the production of ingredients useful for the formulation of new beverage and food products. Among the main results achieved during the project, there are the development and assessment of procedures for the selection, stabilization and the physical/biological treatment of citrus and wheat processing by-products, the obtainment and recovery of some bioactive molecules and ingredients and the development of
procedures for assessing the quality of the obtained ingredients and for their exploitation in the preparation of new food products.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings demonstrate that it is possible to extract and exploit value added components from food processing co-products and to produce high quality functional ingredients for commercialisation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4F0E8411-D845-4952-BFC8-EEB719ADE273</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ce7afc233d7.13984686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>91B486D0-E2FF-4F1B-A4F7-031DFA5386BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethanol from a biorefinery waste stream: Saccharification of amylase, protease and xylanase treated wheat bran.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2bac44d3e751cf7bee58f550f96f2453"><gtr:id>2bac44d3e751cf7bee58f550f96f2453</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood IP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0308-8146</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56b1ea165e7773.70647427</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D6F7CB9-D3A7-4D7A-A959-06D395AD0A8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>New advances in the integrated management of food processing by-products in Europe: sustainable exploitation of fruit and cereal processing by-products with the production of new food products (NAMASTE EU).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New biotechnology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/22d425956587af4b6b2d7312f81b0c48"><gtr:id>22d425956587af4b6b2d7312f81b0c48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fava F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1871-6784</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5899d2e95875e2.72339333</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042576</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
