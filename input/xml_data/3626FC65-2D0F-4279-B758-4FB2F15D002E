The impact of design on the balance of payments is an appropriate concern for the DTI and its client [sic], the Design Council; it is not an appropriate preoccupation for an independent museum' (Keat et al, 1994, 162). This perspective - whether accurate, nuanced or partial - is at the core of the proposed PhD that addresses, inter alia, the ways in which museums of contemporary design, whether independent or publicly-funded, are financially underpinned. \n\nEntitled 'The Role of the Design Museum in the 21st Century: national and international perspectives' this PhD is a timely post-CSR investigation into the ways in which design museums, whether publicly or privately funded, have an important public role to play in 21st century life, whether in terms of society and well-being, the cultural agenda, or the economy. Although research will be focused on the Design Museum London, from its origins as the Boilerhouse Project at the V&amp;amp;A in the early 1980s through to the present day, it will also address the wider social and economic context of the history and purpose of design museums and design promotion in Britain and overseas. \n\nAlthough already a project of major significance in the context of design policy and promotion debate over the past 30 years, many of the issues around which it was originally designed have been considerably sharpened in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) announced by H.M. Treasury on 20 October 2010. Particularly relevant to this proposal is the keen debate in the creative and cultural sectors regarding the consequent reductions in public funding in support of arts institutions, organisations and supporting agencies, much of this resulting from the 24% cut in the budget of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) by 2014/15, the period in which the Design Museum moves to central London and by which time this PhD will have been completed. \n\nBuilding on the Design Museum London as a case study, informed by national and international debate, the underlying objectives of this study are: to provide a clear understanding of the potential roles played by design musems in the 21st century in terms of economic, social or cultural impact; to identify the extent to which there are different purposes and priorities in the collection and exhibition of contemporary design in publicly-funded or independent design museums; to provide a clear understanding of the reasons why, how, and to what extent the missions of museums concerned with the acquisition and display of contemporary design have changed in the early 21st century; and to demonstrate the ways in which the legacy of history has impacted upon the aims, objectives and practices of design museums in which contemporary design is a prime focus.\n\nThe research findings will be of particular value to museums and those concerned with the creative and cultural industries, whether policy makers or museum professionals or those working in allied fields concerned with the study of, and research into, museums and their policies, collections, exhibitions and users. The PhD will bring together the expertise and resources of the leading museum of contemporary industrial design in Britain and those of a university with a high national ranking in art and design research (with 35% of its research assessed as world leading, RAE 2008). The opportunity for supervision by the Director of the Design Museum and the Director of the Centre for Research &amp;amp; Development (Arts) at the University of Brighton, supported by the complementary intellectual expertise an</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Design Museum will be a direct beneficiary from the proposed doctoral investigation into 'The Role of the Design Museum in the 21st Century: national and international perspectives' since the research will be executed at a time when it can help to inform the Design Museum's future policies. These relate to its permanent collection and curatorial and exhibition policies and also play a role in building a case for funding and support for future growth, something likely to gain significant media coverage. However, in the wake of the Comprehensive Spending Review announced in October, the impact of the PhD will reach a wider professional and academic constituency at a time when significant budgetary cuts have been made in the creative and cultural industries. These have been characterized by reductions in public subsidies for arts institutions and organizations such the as the Design Council which ceases to be a Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB). Furthermore, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) will no longer function in its current form after 2012. As a result, the significance of contemporary design as an agent of social, cultural and economic change will be increasingly challenged. This proposed PhD's evidence-based research into the social, cultural and economic significance of the exhibition and promotion of contemporary design will be of particular value to museums and those concerned with the creative and cultural industries, whether policy makers, designers, museum professionals or others working in fields concerned with the study of, and research into, museums and their policies, collections, exhibitions and users. Furthermore, taking into its purview research into selected case studies of different types of international museums of contemporary design such as the red dot museums in Germany and Singapore, the Design Museum Holon and the Toronto Design Exchange (DX), its findings are likely to exert an impact on design museum professionals, politicians and funders overseas as there is a fast-growing number of museums of contemporary design worldwide alongside the continuing proliferation of national design policies in the early 21st century.\n\nResearch results will be tested and disseminated through participation in national and international conferences such as those of the International Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS) the Design History Society, the College Art Association, the Association of Art Historians, the Art Libraries Society (ARLIS), and the International Council of Museums (ICOM) which, in 2001 in Barcelona, held its triennial conference on the theme of 'Managing Change: museums facing social and economic challenge'. Other global organizations with formal connections to the University of Brighton and its Design Archives include ICSID (the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design) and Icograda (the International Council of Graphic Design Organizations). With memberships and affiliations in more than 50 countries they will assist in communicating the research outcomes through their extensive educational networks. Impact will be further enhanced through the international networks of the Design Museum. Influence on a range of academic disciplines and museum professionals will also be engendered through the communication of research findings through periodicals such as Design Issues, the Journal of Design History, the Museum History Journal, Museum and Society, the International Journal of Cultural Policy, the Journal of Visual Culture, and Museum Management and Curatorship. \n\nIt is also anticipated that the research findings will inform policy makers and government departments with an interest in such publications as 'Creative Britain: New Talents for the New Economy' (2008): the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
