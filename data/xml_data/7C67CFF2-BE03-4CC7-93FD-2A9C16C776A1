It is the job of the brain to make sense of the environment we live in. It must extract the most relevant cues and combine this information with memories of past experiences to trigger appropriate behavioural responses. For animals living in different environments the most reliable sensory information may come from different sources, the experiences they have may vary, and what passes as appropriate behaviour can be radically different. The brain must therefore evolve to meet the demands of a changing environment. My research asks how brains accommodate adaptive change, how these changes are brought about, and why one evolutionary solution is favoured over another. 

For over 150 years biologists have studied mimetic butterflies to gain insights into the evolutionary process. Mimicry evolves when distantly related species converge on the same colour pattern to warn predators that they are toxic and to be avoided. This has dramatic knock-on effects, driving changes in habitat preference, sensory environment, foraging and reproductive behaviour. In many cases it results in butterflies that evolved to look the same also behaving in similar ways and occupying similar habitats. This makes them an ideal system to study how brains function and evolve because they are behaviourally diverse and the same behaviours have evolved multiple times.

My project leverages these features to explore how brain structure changes as species diverge into different environments. I will measure the size of distinct components of the brain that have different functions, for example in vision, olfaction or memory. Changes in their relative size imply a change in the importance of that function. By comparing brains of different species I can therefore identify differences in their structure that reflect adaptations to the particular demands of a species' environment. I will then ask how these changes occur: are they are the result of genetic changes or flexibility in the way the brain develops? And how do changes at the cellular level alter the way the brain processes and stores information? 

Understanding how brains evolve is central to understanding the diverse range of behaviour observed in the animal kingdom, a major axis of biodiversity. It can also tell us how quickly animals are able to change their behaviour to respond to rapid environmental change, and whether this requires selection for genetically-encoded adaptations, or if it can be facilitated by flexibility in the way brains and behaviour develop. 

Evolutionary comparisons also provide insightful models for general problems in understanding brain function. For example, what types of cells contribute to changes in brain size? How is brain development controlled? And how do different brain cells connect and communicate with one another? This can tell us about our own biology, and the origin of disorders caused by disruption of these developmental processes.

I will tackle these questions by homing in on specific changes in the way species perceive and remember information about their environment. For example, I have previously shown that one brain region, called the mushroom body, has trebled in size in passion-vine butterflies. The mushroom bodies are implicated in learning and memory, and this explosive expansion may be linked to the skill with which these species navigate their environment. Similarities in the genetic control and functional organisation of the insect mushroom body make it directly comparable to the mammalian forebrain, providing a novel framework for studying general principles in cell proliferation and communication. By considering how mushroom body expansion occurred at multiple biological levels, from genes to cells to behaviour and ecology, I will investigate how processes at these different scales interact to facilitate, or restrict, the way brains function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A) Who will benefit from this research?

1. Teachers and students of ecology and evolution, and neuroscience
2. The public
3. Owners/managers of butterfly houses and museum exhibits
4. Conservation and environmental agencies

B) How will they benefit from this research?

1. I will work with local schools, some of which are currently under OFSTED 'special measures', and create an online resource to convey key concepts in ecology, evolution and neuroscience in an accessible format to promote enthusiasm and interest in STEM subjects. Collaboration between schools and local scientists can significantly enhance a school student's enthusiasm for science. For example, in a recent STEMNET report over 80% of teachers reported an increase in pupil engagement, and over 70% reported an increase in understanding of STEM subjects after contact with local scientists. The project is well suited for this purpose as it addresses multiple broad concepts covered in GCSE and A-level biology syllabuses:
i) Ecology and evolution: The project exemplifies core topics in GCSE and A-level syllabus such as the role ecology plays in shaping biodiversity, interactions between individuals and their environment, co-evolution between flowering plants and foraging insects, the process of adaptation, and the role plasticity plays in diversification. The accessibility and popularity of the study species, and the enigmatic nature of the Neotropics aid communication of these important concepts. 
ii) Neuroscience: This project tackles key concepts in neuroscience in an accessible system where the wider ecological importance can be clearly conveyed. This provides a means to introduce core subjects in school syllabuses such as how organisms respond to changes in their internal and external environments, and how receptors and nerve cells function. 
I will engage with local schools through the STEMNET ambassador scheme, the Nuffield Foundation research placement scheme, and by renewing previous links schools.

2. There is huge enthusiasm for science among the UK public. The 2014 State of Public Attitudes to Science Ipsos-Mori poll found an overwhelming majority (72%) of the public believe it is important to know about science for the daily life, but a majority (58%) also felt scientists put too little effort into informing the public amount their work. Tropical rainforests, brightly coloured butterflies, and weird looking brains offer an enticing combination for a general audience. I will be proactive about using these features to communicate my work, and the importance of the broader concepts, to the wider public through press-releases, community engagement schemes, scientific writing and exploiting existing podcasts based in Cambridge, and my prior experience with multimedia companies. The popularity of the Cambridge Science Festival, Festival of Ideas and the active outreach programs of the University Museums provide ideal opportunities to convey to the importance and excitement of my research to the public.

3. Brightly coloured butterflies are common species in tropical butterfly houses and exhibits, offering an opportunity to communicate scientific concepts in conjunction with popular displays of biodiversity. I will be proactive about establishing connections with butterfly houses in South East England (eg Tropical Wings Zoo, Chelmsford, Shepreth Wildlife Park, and Colchester Zoo), as well as local Zoology museums to collaborate on developing educational resources.

4. Understanding how populations can adapt to rapid environmental change is crucial to understanding the likely effects of climate change on biodiversity. This project will contribute to this understanding by assessing rates of change in brain structure during ecological divergence. By quantifying the relative contribution of plasticity to this process I will address whether plasticity is likely to provide a means by which species can negotiate rapid changes in their environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>550134</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit and Science Festival Project (Swavesey Village College)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A42F3D8D-F87C-4F95-8310-747D712B4C4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>15-20 secondary school pupils from Swavesey Village College Science Club attended a presentation and discussion based on my research.
