Conventional training often leaves musicologists and early music performance researchers poorly equipped to deal with domestic repertoires, and they frequently lack broader understanding of country house history. Conversely, country house historians and heritage professionals often lack the knowledge necessary to interpret musical holdings in historic properties, or to reconstruct a house's musical history when music collections are lacking. Domestic music making has received increased scholarly attention in recent years, and curators, conservators and visitor experience consultants have become increasingly aware of how attention to music can enhance understanding of a house's history and stimulate engagement from today's visitors. Research to date has involved a series of discrete projects, however, each valuable in its own right but necessarily offering only partial perspectives. 
This research network will bring together scholars of history, historical musicology, and historically informed performance practice with heritage professionals in curation, conservation and visitor experience in a broader collaborative effort to gain a richer understanding of the way that music functioned in the country house. Activities will include three study days, each focussing on a different strand of the broader theme of country house music making. The three study days will address challenges to historical music research in heritage properties; issues in the research management of music collections in historic houses; and interpretive approaches to music for use in heritage today. The network aims to pool and extend existing knowledge and to improve communication and partnership between academics and heritage sector researchers. A stronger research base will in turn stimulate development of innovative ideas for the practical deployment of musical research in heritage properties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will involve benefits for a wide array of non-academic audiences. The heritage sector professionals who participate in the network will gain opportunities for significant knowledge exchange with academic researchers, providing ways of disseminating their own work more effectively within academic communities and of tapping into the scholarship produced in academic circles. Curators and conservators will gain significant new knowledge about music, a crucial element that has been largely absent from existing understandings of country house life. This knowledge will aid them in constructing research materials for use in heritage properties (the historical material used in visitor guides, room cards, and information files produced by curators) and in managing the musical collections in their care. By learning more about musical life in country houses, visitor experience consultants from the heritage sector will gain a new understanding of how music can enhance their work in interpreting properties for visitors; they will be provided with tools both for presenting music-making in country houses, and for using music to help with interpretations of other aspects of the material and historical context. The network can thus be considered as providing career development for this group, and a context for the development of valuable lasting relationships with music researchers.

Through the work of heritage professionals, the volunteers who staff many country houses and the larger public who visit them will in turn benefit from the network's activities. One goal of the network is the construction of tools for the deployment of musical research in historic properties in imaginative and innovative ways. We aim to stimulate production of better information for use in properties, including not only printed or online material for distribution (eg guidebooks, brochures, websites) but also in the briefing documents and information files supplied to volunteer room guides, house managers, and others who interact with heritage visitors on the ground. We also aim to explore other possibilities for display and interpretation, including events, interactive displays and multimedia tools. Visitor experience consultants involved in the network will help other participants to understand the challenges and possibilities, and will help us most effectively to adapt the network's outputs and activities to the needs and interests of volunteers and visitors.

Professional performers involved with the network will benefit from insights into new or little-known repertories, and will have opportunities for experimentation and development of new modes of presentation that are better adapted to domestic repertoires than the standard concert hall approach. They will gain new contacts in the heritage sector as an outlet for their work, and in cases where they regularly perform with their own or others' performing groups (eg Harvey Davies, who leads the Pleyel Ensemble) they will provide a means of disseminating information and ideas through the wider early music world. 

The activities of the performers in the network will also stimulate benefits for a wider public of music listeners, whether or not they are also regular visitors to country houses. Early music listeners may be attracted to events at heritage properties because of the repertoires and performers rather than the location, but in attending will gain a new understanding of how the music fits into historic material contexts. The production of commercial recordings and concerts by the network's historically informed performance researchers will help to improve understanding and communication between the heritage sector and the mainstream early music world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32895</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F6F6F7E-C9B4-4D75-A979-128A7B8DEA86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributions to major new interpretative project at The Vyne, opened spring 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58affc8049e1b0.52988215-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to a primary research materials held in National Trust properties; staff time and expertise.

We discovered a huge appetite for specialist musical knowledge within the heritage community and have responded to requests for:
- examples of effective deployment of musical research in heritage settings (provided through a set of model case studies mounted on the Sound Heritage website)
- modes of ongoing communication and news flow between historical performers, music academics and heritage sector (provided through creation of an open Sound Heritage Facebook group (over 100 members), Twitter feed, and website news section)
- help with basics of understanding music and musical materials in heritage collections (creation of a resources guide for heritage professionals and music students beginning work in this field)
Particularly exciting findings arose from the inclusion of international representatives (from Ireland, Australia and the USA) and from the wide range of UK members including Welsh and Scottish representatives. Comparisons of both historical research and interpretive possibilities across geopolitical boundaries was highly revealing, and underlined the different interpretive contexts of colonial and postcolonial historical research, and the need for different visitor experience strategies to convey this understanding to today's audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The has been enormous interest in extend the Sound Heritage network to other countries and to expand the remit to include historic houses beyond the original remit of 18th/19th century English country houses. This has already been implemented through the creation of the international Facebook group, which has participation from Australia, USA, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway, and which continues to grow. Through the efforts of the Irish representative to the network (one of three international members invited to the project), the Irish Research Council and the University of Limerick have funded a branch organisation, Sound Heritage Ireland, to bring together heritage professionals and music academics in the Republic and Northern Ireland. Sydney Living Museums has emerged as a particularly dynamic leader of new initiatives in musical interpretation in historic houses, and will host a Sound Heritage Sydney symposium in March 2017 to bring UK representatives to speak to Australian heritage audiences, recruited from the heritage sector throughout the country (including ACT and Victoria as well as NSW).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ECAA0866-A013-4AD2-9C37-6A42E6C48040</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bc64dd29a630.51356027</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sound-heritage.soton.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M00872X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8F220D14-A48F-413D-9D9E-0756C51CE2B0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3BFAE48F-77C7-453F-8049-A1455B8B0E96</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
