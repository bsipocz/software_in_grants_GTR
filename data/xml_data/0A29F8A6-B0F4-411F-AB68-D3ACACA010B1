These convective systems can be found in groups of many different sizes, from isolated showers and thunderstorms to equatorial waves to tropical cyclones to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), an eastward-propagating weather system composed of superclusters of convection several thousand kilometres across which dominates tropical weather variability on weekly to monthly time scales. Global numerical weather forecast and climate models still do not adequately simulate these organized storm clusters and, as a result, have too little (or incorrect) variability of tropical rainfall. Improvement of the representation of organized tropical convection, and therefore the accuracy of weather forecasts, would greatly improve the lives of billions of people who rely on rainfall for agriculture in the tropics and subtropics; better forecasts of strong storms and flooding would also save countless lives and reduce property damage. Furthermore, these processes may change in the future as the climate changes due to human activities, so an improvement of the ability of global models to simulate organized convection will lead to better predictions of possible climate change scenarios over the whole globe. Global weather and climate models divide the Earth into grid boxes about 100 km across. These boxes are too large to directly simulate the motions responsible for small-scale rainstorms, instead estimating total rainfall based on average conditions in the box. This simplified rain estimation, necessary because of limited computer resources, ignores the interaction of isolated rain showers with each other and regional weather conditions. An exciting new research area is the study of organized convection in high-resolution idealized models. These models, with constant sea surface temperatures and constant sunlight, can now be run on domains several thousand kilometres across and with grid boxes of only a few kilometres long, allowing convection to be represented explicitly. These models are beginning to provide insight into processes that lead to spontaneous growth of convective clusters which can ultimately grow to a single large cluster accounting for all of the rainfall in the domain. These processes act over a wide range of spatial scales which are not fully resolved in global models. However, the processes which lead to organized convection in idealized models are still not well understood, and it is not known whether they are also important for organizing tropical convection in nature. This fellowship will exploit a large archive of high-resolution model runs, forecast analyses, and observations from satellites to make more direct comparisons between idealized cases and observed phenomena. Ultimately, this endeavour has the potential to lead to improvements in the way that global models, especially the UK Met Office Unified Model, simulate tropical rainfall and with it global weather and climate. This fellowship will benefit from being undertaken at the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, a world-leading centre for atmospheric science. Close ties with the Met Office ensure that this research will be interactive with ongoing efforts to improve the simulation of convection and tropical weather and climate in the Unified Model. In addition, there will be collaborations with other scientists approaching similar problems using different models, which will allow for exploration of possible model differences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>268188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC News at Nine interview, 8 July 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE5AEBF2-C09E-418F-8159-35A7C9C00E7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave short TV interview about a tropical cyclone threatening Japan.

So far, the main novel findings are:

1) Radiative feedbacks are important for self-aggregation in idealised models, and they also maintain stronger moisture gradients (which aid in convective organisation) in realistic simulations of tropical convection.

2) Shallow circulations that aid in organisation can be driven by anomalous convective heating (condensation) rather than radiation, at least in our idealised simulations.

3) Low clouds increase, and anvil clouds increase, with increased convective aggregation in satellite radar cloud profile observations, confirming findings in idealised models and suggesting that these cloud features in the models are fairly consistent with observations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Scientists who study the tropical atmosphere are increasingly seeking to understand self-aggregation in idealised simulations and relate this to real-world organised tropical convection (including phenomena such as tropical cyclones and the Madden-Julian Oscillation). I have shared my work at several gatherings of the key people in this field, including a recent workshop at the International Space Science Institute in Bern, and this work will help guide future modelling and observational efforts to explore this problem further. For instance, I will be involved in writing a book based on topics discussed in the workshop, and there are also field campaigns planned to look into this topic further.

The main ways that this project will benefit society on a wider basis will be in ongoing efforts to improve convective parameterisations in numerical weather and climate models. For instance, I will be part of a large joint NERC-Met Office project aimed at a step change in convective parameterization, and part of that will include efforts to model organisation of convection. Similar efforts in Germany, Australia, the US and other countries will also benefit from ideas that came out of this project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9E9AAE2D-2878-4E84-AC1E-438E697C09F1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d48927a2a3c5.34679343</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D92A459D-4E37-4CF3-9C8E-8B4C91F3CE50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does convective aggregation need to be represented in cumulus parameterizations?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a7e247bb41ec7805232d18b7b25b2e7a"><gtr:id>a7e247bb41ec7805232d18b7b25b2e7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tobin I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfc5fc5c62997a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5BF165F0-704D-44CD-A836-933494A59DBA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Convective aggregation in realistic convective-scale simulations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2369e7711e495969810ac65bdab39723"><gtr:id>2369e7711e495969810ac65bdab39723</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holloway C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59590014cfc916.58298297</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>90D7DA7F-015E-4BFA-B9C4-CFD2B7111461</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding and representing atmospheric convection across scales: recommendations from the meeting held at Dartington Hall, Devon, UK, 28-30 January 2013</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Atmospheric Science Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2369e7711e495969810ac65bdab39723"><gtr:id>2369e7711e495969810ac65bdab39723</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holloway C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545249c6184759.52693139</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E13E4E98-1B22-46C4-AA22-6B8EE665B5B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Observed Relationships between Cloud Vertical Structure and Convective Aggregation over Tropical Ocean</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Climate</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/db32bf3795a7ac1ca70fee36af4e8574"><gtr:id>db32bf3795a7ac1ca70fee36af4e8574</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stein T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58989fa67dcd00.83923563</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>212FC04D-7241-45B9-AA78-5B2442ECFB49</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Effects of Explicit versus Parameterized Convection on the MJO in a Large-Domain High-Resolution Tropical Case Study.
