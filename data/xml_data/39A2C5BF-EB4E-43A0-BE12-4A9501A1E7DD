However, there has never been any agreement on which thinkers or theories count as existentialist. Academic discussions of existentialism are thereby significantly fragmented, with different disciplines taking different works as paradigmatic of existentialism, making it very difficult for insights into existentialism from any one of these disciplines to inform discussions of existentialism in any other, or for insights from discussion of one thinker to inform discussions of other thinkers. So although the discussions of existentialism within each discipline have been fruitful, they have been hampered by this lack of any core conception of existentialism.

This project will overcome this fragmentation by developing and disseminating a core conception of existentialism. It will be argued that the central tenet of existentialism is the claim 'existence precedes essence', which means that an individual has no fixed personality but rather develops character through experiences and actions. But it will also be argued that the core of existentialism is not the form of this claim that Sartre propounded when he first defined the term in 1945, which entails that the individual can at any time adopt an entirely new character. It is instead the form of this claim that Beauvoir propounded at that time and that Sartre later came to accept, according to which the individual's character becomes embedded as time goes on, to the point at which it cannot be changed. It is this idea of 'becoming', or habituation, the project will argue, that is at the core of the mature form of existentialism shared by Beauvoir, Fanon, and Sartre in 1952.

This will be argued through analysis of the core philosophical and literary works of Beauvoir and Sartre over the period 1943-1952 and analysis of Fanon's work of 1952. This analysis will situate existentialism as a form of Freudian psychoanalysis, rather than the opponent to it that it is usually understood to be. It will explain why Beauvoir and Sartre were right to resist the criticisms brought by their colleagues Camus and Merleau-Ponty, neither of whom accepted the core tenet of existentialism. It will draw out implications of this reading of existentialism for the metaethical question of how there can be any moral values with legitimate claim over us and for contemporary debates over the nature and knowledge of the self. All of this will be detailed in an academic monograph, Rethinking Existentialism, written in a style accessible to advanced undergraduates and with the argumentative sophistication characteristic of leading academic journals. This book is already under contract at Oxford University Press.

The final draft of the monograph will be developed through interdisciplinary workshops on Beauvoir's conception of becoming and on Fanon's moral psychology, which will bring leading scholars together to explore the project's themes; through a conference bringing leading scholars of existentialism together with practitioners of psychotherapy; and through a YouTube channel of short accessible lectures on the central ideas of the project.

Although the monograph could in principle be completed through contractual research time and sabbatical research leave, albeit more slowly than through this project, the other objectives are dependent on the release of my time from other duties and financial support for the direct costs of the events. Without those other objectives, the final form of the monograph would not be sufficiently integrated with the discussions of existentialism in psychotherapy and in academic disciplines other than philosophy to realise its potential as the foundation of the new interdisciplinary investigation of existentialism that this project aims to establish.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three categories of beneficiaries beyond academia that this project is specifically designed to benefit.

First, it is designed to benefit professional psychotherapists interested in the application of new ideas to their work. The project's central ideas will be developed in part through a conference bringing scholars of existentialism together with practising psychotherapists to discuss aspects of existentialist literature central to the account of existentialism that this project will detail. This conference is organised with the Philadelphia Association, an organisation central to the development of psychotherapeutic practice. Registration will be open and the conference will be advertised within the professional psychotherapy community. Papers derived from transcripts of these discussions will be made permanently available on the internet. The conference is intended to inaugurate a series of further collaborations on this topic between the PI and the Philadelphia Association, which may result in the use of ideas developed through this collaboration in the Philadelphia Association's own psychotherapist training programmes.

Second, it is designed to benefit media, theatre, and community groups interested in producing Sartre's classic play Huis Clos. The PI's original interpretation of this play is central to the project's development of an original account of existentialism. An essay sketching this interpretation has already influenced two major productions of the play, one at Trafalgar Studios in London and one at Kelvin Studios in Bristol. A page of the project website will provide access to the details of this interpretation, through a copy of the essay and a short YouTube video as well as materials from the two recent productions. It will invite people using this material in productions of the play to contact the PI for further discussion and to submit details of the production for dissemination through the project's website, Facebook group, twitter feed, RSS feed, and email list.

Third, the project's series of YouTube lectures will also benefit the public at large by making an accessible and detailed introduction to this major intellectual movement of the twentieth century freely and permanently available, not only for use by private individuals but also licensed for general noncommercial use and therefore likely to be used in educational contexts across the English-speaking world. Together, these movies will constitute a comprehensive study of existentialism. But each lecture will be entirely self-contained, easily comprehensible on its own, and clearly labelled with its content. The lecture on psychoanalysis, for example, should be of interest to psychotherapists, or the lecture on Huis Clos to theatre groups, without the need to watch the whole series.

This public engagement strand is particularly designed to facilitate potential impacts of the research that have not been specifically envisaged in designing the project. The project website and YouTube channel will include a general invitation to potential users of this research outside of academia to contact the PI for further discussion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68033</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Facebook page (Rethinking Existentialism)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B90FDE12-10EA-483F-84ED-EFFA9844FCF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Purpose was to publicise the project's activities.
