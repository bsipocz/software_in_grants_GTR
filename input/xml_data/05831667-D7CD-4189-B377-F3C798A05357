This project aims to provide answers, and to determine the factors associated with fuller use. To what extent are collections accessed and used, by whom and for what purposes? What seem to be the obstacles to using collections? What could museums do to generate better access and use?\n\nIt is being undertaken in collaboration with the major national players in the sector. The MLA and the Museum Documentation Association have funded a research fellow. A Steering Group includes the National Museum Directors' Conference, the Museums Association and ICON: the Institute for Conservation.\n\nResearch context\n\nThere are over 2000 museums in England and Wales. Their collections comprise an estimated 200 million objects, yet less than 10 per cent. are on display. There is only rudimentary and patchy quantitative or qualitative evidence on the extent that collections are accessed or used, in surveys and reports from the Museums, Libraries and Archive Council (MLA), regional museum bodies and others.\n\nAims and objectives\n\nThe objectives of the project are to establish:\n\n- The scope and use of the collections: their size, distribution geographically and among different types of museum, and their wide variety. Collections range from a few objects to millions; from specialist to general; representing different subjects and types of object. The research is establishing the extent to which collections are being used, what collections, by what groups of users, how much, and for what purposes.\n\n- The extent to which different types of collection are used by people other than museum staff; what are the types of user; and what uses they make of collections, such as research, teaching and learning, creative activities, individual interest, visits for enjoyment such as store tours. (Keene, 2005).\n\n- How museums provide for collections use, by actively marketing, or publishing information on what is in their collections. What they see as the impediments to increasing use.\n\n- How museums provide for collections use, and how users experience the service. What factors users find helpful, and what are the barriers and problems they encounter. \n\n- What factors are associated with fuller or less use: the kind of museum; collection size; and type of collection. The effect of practical issues: convenience of access; relationship with local or subject based interest groups; and how people find out what the collection comprises.\n \nOther objectives are to disseminate the results through an informative website, a generally accessible report, a detailed scholarly publication, and a national conference to be held in summer 2008; and to leave a research archive for future researchers.\n\nResearch methods\n\nThe research archive of extensive existing work from the various MLAs and other organisations is being assembled via online and print publications. A quantitative and qualitative survey has gathered data on collections, their uses and users, supplemented by telephone discussions, case study visits and workshops for museums. Users of collections are being identified and contacted in parallel.\n\nPotential applications and benefits\n\nThe many museum professionals contacted in the research are extremely interested in the research. The steering group for the project includes the major national organisations.\n\nWorking with these organisations, findings will be disseminated through workshops for museums, held in London, Newcastle and Birmingham; publication in an informative website, a detailed academic publication and a public summary report; and a national conference, to be held at the end of the project. Finally, an organised research archive will provide the basis for future work.\n\nThe outcome will be a much better understanding by museums and also policy and strategic bodies of how collections as a public resource can be better used.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F013019/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
