Some seventy extant manuscripts in English, Anglo-Norman and French will be examined, and data collected relating to centres of production, patrons and owners. The data will be collated and analysed in order to establish patterns of textual production, transmission and ownership, and the ways in which these changed over time. The project also tracks changes in the form and content of the text, and considers the extent to which these can be linked to culturally specific historical moments. A particular concern of the project will be to establish points of contact between the physical texts and named people and places, in order to identify real reading and writing events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have impact on commercial private sector and third sector organizations, and members of the general public, including those with broad historical, cultural and heritage-based interests.\n\nThe importance the project places on the communication of its findings to the wider public, in ways that are both intellectually rigorous and accessible, has the potential to have impacts for the commercial private sector and third sector organizations such as cathedrals, churches and museums. Through the exhibition and the publication of popular articles in non-academic media, public interest and the appetite for further knowledge will be stimulated, helping to secure the readership of relevant magazines and to maintain or increase visitor numbers to cathedrals and museums. These impacts may be felt almost immediately, and one measure would be visitor numbers to the proposed exhibition.\n\nThe project also has the potential to enhance quality of life for the general public more broadly, by increasing knowledge and understanding of important aspects of history and culture. By communicating the findings of research in attractive and accessible forms, the public is able to share in the country's intellectual capital and to feel that they have a stake in its intellectual life; interest in broad-based historical, cultural and religious studies will be stimulated, and might lead to further study, whether formal or informal, or participation in clubs and societies for people sharing similar interests.\n\nThe project team will develop existing skills in the handling of manuscripts and other documents. Members will also acquire data collection and management skills, and an understanding of website design. Skills in conference and exhibition organization, and writing for a non-academic audience will also be acquired. The RA will have the opportunity to build on existing language skills to develop competence in modern French.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We produced a small exhibition of manuscripts and early printed books relating to the project at Canterbury Cathedral Library in November 2013. We hope to build on this and produce a larger exhibition to coincide with planned activity to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the 4th Lateran Council in 2015.

We were unfortunately unable to link in with the 4th Lateran Council anniversary exhibition, as other more relevant materials were selected for this.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>35215808-A02B-492C-B534-9E369175AD54</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461d6a86ad2d7.46432482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The major finding has been the very wide range of readers of the Elucidarium throughout the Middle Ages. Contrary to previous scholarly understanding, the manuscript evidence has revealed an audience which comprises both clergy and laity, and which extends across social classes from the wealthy elites to manual workers such as carpenters. It has not always been possible to understand how individual manuscripts came to be in such diverse hands, however.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>When the website goes live, it will make the manuscript catalogue avaiable to other researchers, enabling them to undertake substantive work on this corpus electronically.

The evidence of wide readership is of significant interest in reconfiguring our understanding of the dissemination and use of texts in medieval England and also in France.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6D0DEF86-3B84-442E-B781-36A2397A2D1E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461d617a665f7.50304380</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.kent.ac.uk/web/themes/elucidarium/news.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>625CFFE2-48D3-4E31-9B32-D9AA700CF68E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pastoral Care in Medieval England: Interdisciplinary Approaches</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c44f9c6ec38b5f6e01fad923d5d6a020"><gtr:id>c44f9c6ec38b5f6e01fad923d5d6a020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>James S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5461d339183192.49286390</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02545X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>950E3601-19AF-48B8-9030-FB18B0E0FB1A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medieval Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
