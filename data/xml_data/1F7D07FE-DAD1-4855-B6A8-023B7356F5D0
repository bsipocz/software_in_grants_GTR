Since the widespread acceptance of evolutionary theories in the mid-nineteenth century the idea that nature, rather than nurture, dominates human identity has been investigated frequently. However, after the horrendous results of state-sanctioned eugenic programmes during the 1930s and 40s, bio-social science was treated with a great deal of scepticism; in particular by historians and social scientists, who rejected what they saw as biological reductionism in favour of ideas about the social and cultural construction of human identity. During the past 30 years, though, scholars such as sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists have attacked that consensus by arguing that truthful accounts of humans, society, culture, and history should be rooted in the natural sciences. This idea is currently being developed prominently in &amp;quot;neuro-history&amp;quot;: a programme that aims to change the way history is written by rooting the analysis of social change in our understanding of the human brain. When taken-for-granted conceptions of what it is to practice history are being questioned, there is a fundamental need to interrogate the relationship between biology and social understanding. 

My project contributes to these discussions in two different ways. Firstly, I will research a book on the intersection of biology, politics, and social investigation in twentieth-century Britain, provisionally entitled &amp;quot;The Invention of Social Mobility: Biology, Social Science, and Class in Mid-Twentieth-Century Britain&amp;quot;. Concentrating on the period from the late 1910s, when eugenics was entering a two-decade height of popularity, to the late 1960s, when the agendas, aims, and practices we identify with modern social research were stabilised, my research will explore a set of debates about the nature of society and social structure that created and shaped key concepts, including &amp;quot;social mobility,&amp;quot; which are central to contemporary politics and social policy. More specifically, I will analyse the underappreciated intellectual exchanges in those debates between biologists and social investigators-in particular demographers, economists, and sociologists-who were brought together not only by shared interests in topics such as intelligence, fertility, nutrition, and poverty but also funding bodies such as the Rockefeller Foundation. In so doing, I will throw light on how dialogue between natural and social science played a hugely productive role in shaping not only disciplinary boundaries but also the way we and modern social policy makers think about society. 

Secondly, my research will support a broad set of leadership development and impact activities, which will not only facilitate interdisciplinary discussion about new research agendas but also extend significantly my growing international reputation as an expert on the history of the relationship between biological and social thought. Whilst I will disseminate my research findings to a number of different research communities through targeted publications and conference presentations, I will also bring together scholars from the natural sciences, social sciences, and history for a major international conference. The aim of that conference will be to discuss not only the serious issues biological and neuro- science currently raise for scholars in history and the social sciences but also the potential for historians and social scientists to shape agendas in the other direction. Along with a programme of public engagement, including public lectures, these activities will concentrate minds, both inside and outside academia, on an important set of conversations that are emerging at the intersection of a number of different fields and help shape pressing interdisciplinary research agendas</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1 Beneficiaries

My project has the potential for impact with a wide reach and strong significance. There are three broad types of beneficiaries. The first broad type is the general public who have an interest in the potential relationships between the humanities, the social sciences, the natural sciences and policy. The second are policy makers who have an interest in how science, and the social sciences in particular, have historically informed policy decisions. The final group includes researchers from a wide range of public sector and private sector organizations who are interested in history, sociology, science and policy making. These groups will be reached through outreach activities at the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, a charitable society founded in 1822, and the York Festival of Ideas, a literary festival founded in 2011. 

However, as part of its programme, the project includes an activity aimed at smoking out additional beneficiaries and types of impact. Part of the project will be dedicated to discussing, with a wide range of stakeholders, what the full range of beneficiaries for this work might be and how the significance of those benefits can be fully realized, both inside and outside the academy. These efforts will provide opportunities for enhancing range and significance beyond the lifetime of the project. These issues are highlighted in the &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot; section. 


2 How they might they benefit from this research

Issues around social mobility are prevalent in contemporary political debate and social policy making, as well as in social science where class has recently been re-investigated through the BBC's Great British Class Survey. The three types of beneficiaries that have been identified are therefore open to and currently interested in the broad themes that frame my project. These groups will benefit from research that situates questions about class and social mobility in new and intellectually challenging contexts, which will be made available through free and informed lectures, debates, web sites and publications. In addition to providing an important stimulus for reflecting on questions relating to social mobility, those public engagement activities will stimulate the three identified groups' interest in a wide range of cross disciplinary areas, including the relationship between social mobility and the biological sciences. While it is not anticipated that the research will have a direct impact on specific policies it is anticipated that they will provide policy makers with a better understanding of their contextual framework. 

The research will also generate impact through the wider research community. A workshop at the major international conference on biology, history and the social sciences will encourage wider views and understanding of not only the types of impact that interdisciplinary work in this area might generate, as well as how that impact might better be generated, among stakeholders, both inside and outside academia. The process of discussing these issues will encourage researchers in the field to think about the potential impact of their own work and how they might engage with the impact agenda. This discussion has the potential to generate a bid for follow-on funding from the AHRC. 

The two institutions that will host the impact activities will also benefit from the planned impact activities. The Yorkshire Philosophical Society will benefit from the project by enabling it to include within its programme a presentation and discussion in an area that it would be impossible to secure from elsewhere. The Society will hopefully further benefit from even stronger links with the University and open up even further opportunities for lectures, presentations and discussions. The York Festival of Ideas will benefit in a similar manner but through the provision of a high profile panel discussion chaired by the project's principal investigator.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139555</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Social Mobility: The Complex Origins of a Difficult Idea&quot;, York Festival of Ideas, 15 June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>734ADDEA-B2B1-47B2-8345-072E6A7768A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>York Festival of Ideas took place from 7 to 19 June 2016 with a theme of Tick Tock.

The talks were grouped together in sessions of four, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A. I presented a short talk on my research connected with the idea of &amp;quot;meritocracy&amp;quot;, using the recent debate about grammar schools as its focus.
