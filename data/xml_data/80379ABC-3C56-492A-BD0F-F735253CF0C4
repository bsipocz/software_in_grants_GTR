To this end, we have structured ourselves as a network which links research, teaching, and good practice across many departments of the University. The network comprises researchers and projects of various sizes, with a number of particular flagship large initiatives, which draw in research activity from across the University, including the Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre, and the Cyber Studies Programme. 

The status as an Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research helps to catalyse such initiatives, to bring together researchers in new projects and activities, and to raise the profile nationally and internationally of the research in this area. Our network of projects and academics across the University also provides a context and pool of expertise to refer to when individual academics are making their own grant proposals, as well as a clearing-house for external enquiries - whether from the press, or from companies and others seeking research partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main purpose of this ACE-CSR proposal is for impact. In addition to the pre-existing academic disciplines which benefit from the research through the usual means, the following beneficiaries exist:

* the wider academic community: the breath of concerns faced in the challenges of Cyber Security are not always appreciated by the academic community at large. Some may be undertaking research which might fall into this category, without realising it; others have techniques and expertise which could be brought to bear, but are unaware of the opportunities - for research funding and for engaging with real, pressing problems for society.

* the information security community: practitioners of security and vendors of solutions will always need to drawn on expertise which helps to address new and emerging threats - research which covers those topics which are not yet mundane or every-day in character. The centre will improve communication with this community - both for dissemination
and for motivating new research.

* the public sector: by providing a flagship centre, the University will enable public bodies (as well as the private sector) better to understand the capabilities which it can offer and the partnerships which are possible - in some contexts, the University having much more flexibility in undertaking projects, or a range of untapped expertise hard to assemble elsewhere.

* the general public: the University takes seriously a public education and dissemination mission. Members of the University frequently participate in the Media in order to explain or comment upon issues of security or privacy - and how members of the public are impacted or can protect themselves. Through the better linkages and internal communications
enabled by the centre, this public engagement will be strengthened.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81931</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R006784/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
