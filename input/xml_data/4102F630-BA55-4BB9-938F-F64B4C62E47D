Although we can read and write in this biological code, the set of rules through which it is executed changes over time, according to the signals the cell receives from the surrounding environment. This strategy ensures cell health, but complicates our efforts to have microbes perform additional functions, for example to produce a drug of interest. To implement a new function in a cell, we need to modify or add new DNA code to the existing master program.

But how should we write it? Can we predict in advance how the cell will execute it under different environmental conditions? Can we identify conditions in which the added code will not impair cellular functions while providing the desired output?

To address these questions I will insert in yeast cells pieces of 'DNA code' written to perform functions of increasing complexity: single units (biological parts) and interconnected units (synthetic circuits). The function they implement will be controlled using chemicals provided to the cells and observed by measuring a fluorescent signal that reports on the executed task. I will then use fluorescence images of the cells, acquired through time-lapse microscopy, to follow over-time the performance of the synthetic circuits under various environmental conditions. These environmental conditions will be selected so as to uncover the execution mechanisms, while minimizing the number of experiments necessary to gain this understanding. Linking the selected environmental conditions to the measured tasks, I will write mathematical formulas, which will allow the output of the code to be predicted under untested experimental conditions. 

The set of identified execution rules will enhance our ability to write 'DNA code' that is executed by the cells in the way we desire. We will thus be able to guide the design of code yielding more complex functions with potential applications from medicine to biotechnology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I see two main groups of beneficiaries:

1. Industry operating in the biotechnology sector;

2. The general public through increasing their awareness and understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology.

First, the current approach for the characterization of synthetic circuits resorts to the selection of specific environmental conditions towards which the implemented device are optimized. Although this approach has been justified as an attempt to circumvent context-driven functional failures, it has also delayed the exporting of implemented networks to industrial settings. Indeed, the experimental conditions tested in research are likely to be unfulfilled with the scale-up of cultures required for production purposes. Furthermore, the inevitable chemical gradients arising in fed-batch cultures imply that subpopulations of cells will experience time-varying environmental signals. Causing the partition of the cell culture in phenotypically heterogeneous subpopulations, this time and space-varying environment can compromise production yields. By delivering predictive mathematical models for biological parts and their context dependency, my project would reduce the time-to-market of synthetic biology applications. Specifically, it would provide the basis for the adoption of a model-guided design and debug of synthetic circuits for production purposes, thus accelerating the prototyping of innovative solutions. Further, it would provide an in silico tool to rapidly identify the range of environmental conditions consistent with the maintenance of an in vivo expected behaviour of engineered microbes. Importantly, my focus is on yeast: a microbe that has been widely exploited in fermentation processes. 

Second, my research has the capacity to engage the public with its focus on fluorescence and time-lapse microscopy, which provide powerful visual tools for education and increasing scientific awareness. One goal is to demonstrate the interdisciplinary approaches necessary to deepen our understanding of biological phenomena and to best utilise this information when designing and implementing new biological devices. Working at the interface between synthetic and systems biology, with a project relying on and contributing to several disciplines, I aim to encourage students to attend an interdisciplinary training. With this aim I will actively contribute to the Open Doors Day organized by the University of Edinburgh over the three years of the project. A second goal is to communicate to the general audience the results of my research project, showcasing future perspectives of synthetic biology. Indeed, the expected impact of this new technology on societal and economical challenges will be fully achieved only when our research agenda will integrate and address hopes and concerns arising in the public view. To this aim, I plan on delivering an exhibit for the general public on cells as active biological-processors and presenting it at the Midlothian Science Festival in October 2018 (and also October 2019) and at the Edinburgh International Science Festival in April 2019.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280667</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P017134/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF4CD176-73D5-4039-BBC7-28D33DC364DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Synthetic biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
