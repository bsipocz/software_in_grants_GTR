The prototype sensor under development has arisen as a result from previous projects funded by NERC, EPSRC and BBSRC/IUK. Bioelectrochemical Systems (BES) technology, incorporating an electrode-supported microbial biofilm which generates electricity from oxidation of organics, has great potential for low-cost, real-time sensing applications. The magnitude of the electrical current generated correlates with the biodegradable organic loading (e.g. Biochemical Oxygen Demand; BOD) and conversely the signal is inhibited when toxic compounds are present. Using a novel configuration of multi-stage BES sensors developed by Newcastle University, the sensor is capable of measuring an extended BOD range and can explicitly distinguish BOD and toxicity events. The sensor will be used to monitor organic load/BOD and toxicity levels in real-time on wastewater provisioned from a real-world, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Long-term monitoring data will be collected over one year and used to inform design and build of a combined sensor package, which will propel the technology towards commercial realisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed technology could enable regulatory bodies and companies dealing with wastewater to modernise their existing water quality monitoring schemes, improve operational efficiency and uncover many beneficial commercial and environmental advantages pertaining to real-time monitoring. This project will facilitate translation of this technology developed in the laboratory to field trials conducted in real-world applications.

The main impact from this project will be demonstration of a 'prototype' device capable of near real-time water quality assessment. Advancing to this stage with validated results is the first key milestone required for significant impact, without which the technology will remain a laboratory novelty and cannot be evaluated by interested parties.
Bioelectrochemical Systems (BES) currently have amassed a significant scientific interest amongst research institutions but to date BES technology has been mainly confined to laboratory studies with very few field case studies. In previous trials scaled-up operation has proven challenging and solutions were non-viable. There is therefore an opportunity to create impact by successful application of BES technology towards a sustainable, real-world monitoring solution.

The BES sensor id capable of monitoring biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and toxicity. The sensor is compact (does not require large-scale reactors) but robust enough to cope with continuous reception of a wastewater stream. The sensing system could allow treatment programmes to be adjusted in real-time to match pollution levels, provide early notification of pollution 'shocks' and allow effluents to be monitored for regulatory compliance. By enabling continuous monitoring companies and regulatory bodies could react faster to pollution events, trace sources of pollution along aquatic waterways and ultimately avoid costly fines for non-permitted discharges.

The technology would allow a much greater depth of knowledge to be obtained about water quality which could influence water policies. The technology could be used in the UK and EU to help develop strategies for meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) regulations. But also on a global scale, water quality is a top priority and as populations and industrialisation increase maintaining good quality water systems and tracing pollution sources will only become a more important agenda. There is scope for exploitation of the technology from simple low-level alerting using essential sensor components (such as in developing countries) up to full, quantified water quality assessment which may be required in sensitive discharge areas or in an industrial treatment setting. This technology innovation will drive adoption by regulatory bodies imposing new policies requiring enhanced monitoring or companies proactively deciding to monitor their waste streams in order to gain knowledge about their processes.

The research will proceed through continued dialogue between end-user partners and they will be included in the project planning process. Developing a new technology from proof-of-concept to prototype stage may generate IP relating to innovations from this project. IP protection for any generated will be reviewed frequently. Following completion, we aim to publish not only in academic journals (e.g. Biosensors &amp;amp; Bioelectronics, Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Science and Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology) but also in trade journals, to further disseminate knowledge of the technology and its application to a broader audience. We will also engage with NERC, EPSRC, BBSRC, The Royal Society and SCI networks to foster greater public awareness at dissemination events. We plan to hold an event through our existing networks of contacts at DEFRA, EA, water and industrial companies where we will engage and communicate the outcomes of our project. We will liaise with companies to inform, gauge interest and enquire about future field trials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R009473/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6BF947B0-8E6E-48DB-AB68-7130938F2DF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrument. sensor &amp; detectors</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1B737539-A249-4040-879A-633EBED1F6DB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental biotechnology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98C0D11F-5C27-40CE-A895-54E4C61784B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technol. for Environ.
