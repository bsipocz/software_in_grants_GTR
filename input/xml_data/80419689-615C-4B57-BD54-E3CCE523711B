Beneficiaries of the research will include UK retailers, British growers, the consumer and the UK Government. There will be additional benefits to UK R+D, skills and trade competitiveness. The project is designed specifically to engage with UK-based industry and to operate within the entire fresh produce supply chain, from primary producer through to retail environment. The project will develop and exploit knowledge about the mode of ethylene biosynthesis and action to significantly enhance current commercial practice for extending the shelf life of tomato and pepper. Examples of the latter could include growers and retailers of a wide range of fresh produce, including the extension of the shelf life of fresh vegetables and cut flowers. The wider public will benefit from improved quality products with longer shelf life. In addition the consortium involves colleagues at ADAS and the wider industry consortium to host grower workshops and communicate the outputs of the excellent bioscience to assist immediate assimilation of the wider benefits of the research.
How will they benefit from this research?
There will be direct benefit to UK growers and the retailers and the technology can be put into commercial practice as soon as validated under commercial conditions. It will result in a more equitable supply of fruit will reduce the need for promotions and reduce consumer waste. This is because any perturbation in the supply chain represents a 'glut' or undersupply; whilst oversupply can lead to product price reduction, a lack of produce invariably creates the opportunity for import substitution. The ethylene Fresh+ removal approach, aims to 'suspend' ripening for tomato and pepper at optimal eating quality within the supply chain environments from pack house through to in store retail. Substantial economic benefits would be expected. The value of the UK fresh tomato and pepper markets are respectively &amp;pound;600 and &amp;pound;387m / year with 2 market share occupied by UK production. Improving the consistency of the flow of fruits from harvest to the consumer will smooth the supply chain and contribute at least an extra 5% total market value (an increase in the average value per Kg of product) or &amp;pound;49m / year (&amp;pound;245m over 5 years) to the UK tomato and pepper growers and potentially increase sales revenue to the retailers for UK sourced produce. The treatment should also be applicable to other crops such as field vegetables (UK market &amp;pound;1.1 billion) and non food products such as cut flowers (UK market value &amp;pound;0.8 billion). The guidelines produced, will constitute an important step forward in the development of a strategy to grow and sustain profitable UK sourced fresh tomato and pepper products. 
There will be environmental benefits. Reducing waste will reduce energy inputs per Kg of fresh produce. This will decrease energy costs for processing and transporting fresh food in the supply chain. Smoothing out the supply of fresh products will allow the industry to meet the demand of consumers to include an increasing proportion of fresh produce in their diet. 
The benefits to the UK also include training of a researcher through a project that encompasses both science discovery and delivery of knowledge into commercial practice. The researcher on the project will be in close contact with the major tomato growers in the UK. This will provide invaluable experience of working with leading businesses in the UK horticulture sector. The project will also help strengthen the links between growers, academics and colleagues at ADAS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>300328</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interaction with tomato growers in the UK supplying fruits for this project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E38245D1-6BDF-4D0E-9D93-C228BC791FE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion of outputs of project research allowing direct changes in protocols for storing and handling tomato fruit in commercial practice.
