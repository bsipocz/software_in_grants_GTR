What were people's feelings about and towards the livestock who worked with them? These questions are the starting point for the book project that is central to this proposal. Current historical analyses tell us how important livestock animals were to the development of the economy and to the process of industrialization, for example, but thus far little has been written recognizing the crucial fact that animals are, and always have been, more than simply stock: they are living, sentient beings with whom negotiated interaction is required. This project will take such interactions as its focus and will return animals to the central place they had in the domestic environments of so many, thus tracking a lost aspect of early modern life: the day-to-day relationships between humans and livestock animals.

Tracing the simultaneously emotional and instrumental relationships that humans had with their livestock is of value for a number of reasons. 

1. Historical/Pragmatic: working with animals took up a lot of time (estimates suggest that for some in the early modern period, 75% of waking hours were spent in the company of animals); and the economic and nutritional value of animals (pulling the plough, providing meat or milk) meant that livestock would have been attended to with care because illness or injury would have been a real threat to both human and animal wellbeing. To ignore livestock in the period, therefore, is to ignore something that the people themselves thought of as vital. 

2. Historical/Bigger Picture: the mid-seventeenth century has been recognized as a moment when herd sizes increased and intensive farming began to emerge as the norm. This project would offer a new perspective on this larger social shift, exploring its impact on human-animal relationships, and - by extension - on concepts of the home and the family. 

3. Theoretical/Interdisciplinary: the project is part of a movement in the humanities and social sciences to engage with human-animal relations. Animal Studies is a cross- and interdisciplinary field, and this book will contribute to ongoing scholarly debates about human-animal relations, but also about how such relations might (or might not) be thought about within the theoretical paradigms that we have; and within the disciplinary contexts we work within. 

Associated with this research are three other activities which will engage wider audiences, support interdisciplinary work, foster impact, provide intellectual leadership for junior scholars, and help to shape future research agendas. These are:

1. an article for the magazine History Today (the editors have already commissioned this). This will increase awareness of the history of animals and what it adds to our understanding of the past; and a report for the Centre for Animals and Social Justice on historical shifts in farming;

2. a postgraduate symposium offering the opportunity for current animal studies PGRs to meet and engage with experienced practitioners and scholars in the field. The symposium will focus on three issues: interdisciplinarity; the establishment of animal studies in the undergraduate curriculum; and the potential for those in animal studies to work with non-academic bodies (e.g. policy makers, charities, think tanks);

3. the establishment of an online bibliography, the aim of which will be to make it easier for those in the field to keep up with new work from the range of disciplines involved. Scholars as well as those working with animals outside of academia will be able to access and contribute to the bibliography, and as such it will also enhance the potential of academic work to find wider-than-academic readerships, and offer the opportunity for scholars to engage with work and from outside of academia</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential impact of my work can be best explored by a brief overview of my experience. This includes addressing animal welfare scientists, veterinary scientists, and animal agriculturalists at the EC-funded Welfare Quality conference, 'Knowing Animals', in Florence in 2009. There, discussion focused on establishing new welfare protocols for agricultural animals, and I was invited to open up debate to include consideration of past modes of farming and living with animals. I spoke to a different audience - made up of artists and members of the general public - at another meeting on animals held at the Shropshire Wildlife Trust in Shrewsbury in 2012 where questions of animal sentience and artistic representation were debated. As well as these (and other similar) events, I have also participated in media work: in radio programmes for the BBC; in a podcast for the National Gallery, London; participated in public debates; and was an invited presenter in the well-established 'Nerd Nite' in Phoenix, Arizona.

My directorship of the British Animal Studies Network (BASN) has afforded me the opportunity of engaging with a range of non-academics from, for example, NGOs such as RSPCA, Scottish Wildlife Trust, and RSPB, and I would use the opportunity of the fellowship to further develop such relationships with a view to increasing the potential for impact of my work. Further engagement with the Centre for Animals and Social Justice will enhance the possibility of showing the relevance of debates about historical human-animal relations to the development of future animal welfare policy discussions. 

In addition, my scholarly work has led to invitations to participate in policy-related discussions. For example, I was contacted to discuss the recent spate of dog attacks on humans by 'Counterpoint', a consultancy and think tank commissioned by the Dogs Trust; and I am currently on the stakeholder panel, with colleagues from RSPCA, PDSA, CIWF, DEFRA, and Scottish Government, of a project on adolescents' attitudes to animal cruelty at Scotland's Rural College. These invitations recognize that education will play an increasingly important role in addressing and changing attitudes and policy, and that my work on contemporary and past human-animal relations, and my directorship of BASN puts me at the forefront of debates and developments in the field. 

Central to my work outside of academia is my experience of writing for a general as well as scholarly readership, with two popular monographs and articles in popular history journals. This experience will inform the writing of an article for History Today which will raise the profile of animal studies in a recognized popular magazine (the editors have already commissioned this article). It also increases the opportunities that I will have to take my research to wider audiences in the UK and beyond, and to engage readers in discussions about animals, and about historical work.

Another key impact which goes beyond academia will take place through the proposed PGR symposium. While some aspects of the symposium are concerned with developments within academia, also important will be the discussion of the potential for work in animal studies to have impact. By bringing together current PGRs with established scholars with experience in this area - through working as advisers for organisations such as DEFRA and Welfare Quality - the symposium will look to develop the future of animal studies research. In addition, Bel Deering, a manager for the RSPCA currently leading a project working with teenagers, has also signaled a willingness to participate. This will mean that discussions about the relationship between academic and public/policy discussion will be driven by real experience rather than hypothetical ideals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>130598</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interviewee in BBC Radio 4 Programme, 'Natural Histories Live - The Big Story'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CEE630D-3B88-496B-B791-12DDD4DCBDCC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was interviewed live on stage at the Natural History Museum as part of BBC Radio 4's finale to their landmark series 'Natural Histories'.

I was invited to give one of the 'Vegan Vision Workshops' by the curator of talks Kim Stallwood, and spoke there about the strange history of meat avoidance. The paper emerged from on-going thinking about the killing of domestic animals, and the intellectual debate about meat avoidance during the early modern period, and presented a history that traced a line through Protestant theology; conceptions of purity; the Digger philosophy; and the genuine strangeness of meat-avoidance in the seventeenth century to an audience of festival attendees - mainly non-academics, and including some working for food and farming NGOs. A feature article based on this paper was published by History Today magazine in February 2017. History Today has over 18,000 subscribers, including schools and libraries across the UK.

In addition, in 2015 I had contributed to three programmes in the first series of BBC Radio 4's Natural Histories before the beginning of the fellowship, and during the period of the fellowship I was invited by the BBC to participate in the ground-breaking end of series live event 'Natural Histories Live' in December 2015 (broadcast on 23 December 2015 - and available on BBC Radio iPlayer). In 2016, during the fellowship, I recorded contributions to two programmes for the second series of Natural Histories (broadcast in July 2016 and available on BBC Radio iPlayer).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7D555A92-5AB1-411E-B37B-BD80CC40EF40</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c5b0c5a6eba2.44405244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Outcomes: A book MS - titled Quick Cattle and Dying Wishes: People and their Animals in Early Modern England has been contracted with Cornell University Press, and was submitted to the publishers in December 2016. In addition a short essay on the strange history of vegetarianism and meat-eating has been published by History Today Magazine (February 2017). Another essay for History Today emerging from this project - tentatively titled 'How to Steal a Chicken' - will appear in 2018. As well, a piece on how historical farming relations might impact current debates about farming will appear on the website of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice later in 2017. A postgraduate symposium on interdisciplinarity and animal studies - inspired by my own engagement with work from many disciplines - took place at the University of Strathclyde on 18 and 19 May 2016; and a 'living bibliography' of animal studies was launched online at http://www.lbanimalstudies.org.uk

This project combined traditional archival research (reading c.9000 wills from Essex and London from 1620-1635) with current work from animal welfare science. Through this combination of materials I have been enabled to trace a new understanding of relationships between people and their domestic, working animals that engages with questions of use, value, affection and identification. In addition, I have offered a new way of articulating the shift from pre-industrial to industrial agriculture in England during the seventeenth century and, using data from the wills as well as established historical debates, have located in the increasing urbanisation of early modern England a key shift in human-animal relations that has impacted how we live today. This study thus offers insight into an under-researched aspect early modern English culture: people's relationships with their cows, pigs, sheep, chickens and bees.

The research has opened up new ways of approaching the history of human-animal relations by utilising wills as a key resource. One of the issues that I was addressing was the fact that, in early modern culture, many (most) of those who worked closely with domestic animals - cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry - were not literate, and so left little record. Agricultural manuals offer important insight, but they are not the voice of those at the byre-face; and the wills, I discovered, offered a way of tracing the relationships that people had with the animals on which they relied - for income as well as food and other resources; and with whom they were intimately engaged on a daily basis. As such, this research project has generated new insight into a key aspect of early modern English culture.

In also utilising scholarship from the fields of animal studies and animal welfare science it is possible that the book that has emerged from the research fellowship will also introduce some of the valuable insights from those fields to a historical readership.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I hope that the book will be taken up by scholars in early modern studies where its argument responds to and develops important debates in social, cultural and agricultural history - debates that often do not focus on the animals who were so central as individuals as well as as flocks, herds, hives, to human lives during the period. In addition the book will contribute to debates in the interdisciplinary field of animal studies, and via that into policy discussion (this is especially likely to be the case of the piece that is forthcoming for the Centre for Animals and Social Justice). In addition, a wider audience of the general public (via History Today) was alerted to the value of historical work in what are very pressing current concerns about human-animal relations, the environment, and diet.
