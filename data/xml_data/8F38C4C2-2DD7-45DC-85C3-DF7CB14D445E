Multilingualism</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N004701/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Languages are currently valued mainly as practical tools for basic transactions in monoglot contexts. Yet language use is a creative act. Languages evolve in interaction with the needs of individuals who acquire and shape their linguistic resources in interaction with multiple intersecting communities. They change and mingle as cultural constellations shift, and they rapidly turn new technical possibilities into communicative innovations. 
The crisis of Modern Foreign Languages in UK schools, with its serious consequences for higher education, business, and diplomacy, has its roots in globalisation, the expansion of English as global lingua franca, and diversifying electronic media dominated by English. Arguably it also marks the failure of UK policy-makers and the educational sectors to address these challenges with the necessary understanding, imagination, and unity of purpose. 

This programme exploits the crisis as an opportunity to engage stakeholders in a collaborative process of rethinking the identity of Modern Languages from the ground up. It will seek to dismantle assumed oppositions between 'vocational' and 'academic' purposes, and develop a concept of languages that responds to the multi-faceted needs of individuals and communities in the contemporary world. Researchers from Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Reading, SOAS (London), and Pittsburgh will pool their expertise in some 40 languages to unlock the subject's creative and connective potential by investigating how languages and creativity interact in processes involving more than one language. 

Research in seven interlocking strands will analyse how we turn thoughts into language-specific metaphors (strand 1), deploy the resources offered by our language to name the elements of our environment (strand 2), and negotiate language 'barriers' to intelligibility across related languages (strand 3). They will seek to capture the creative stimulus generated by multilingual theatre and music (strand 4), identify the creative processes initiated by multilingual literature (strand 5), and explore the creation of multiple meanings in the act of translation (strand 6). Empirical research will compare functional and creative methodologies in language learning and establish benefits of creative activities for the literacy, motivation, and confidence that are key factors in take-up and progression (strand 7). 

In order to understand multilingual creativity, we need to engage with a variety of contexts and exchange knowledge with practitioners. Partners from beyond academia will contribute to focus groups, workshops, conferences and specialised projects. To take just a few examples, the British Council will enhance opportunities for engagement with policy-makers and involve learners across the world. Work on community languages within the UK will be augmented by a window onto linguistic communities across over 120 countries opened up by BirdLife International. Collaboration with Sputnik Theatre Company, Punch Records, the Ashmolean Museum and cultural festivals will facilitate cross-language projects with actors and musicians, an exhibition, a 'Linguamania' celebration and a Multilingual Music Fest for primary school children. English PEN will provide opportunities to find out about multilingual experiments by creative writers. Meanwhile language experts from GCHQ and ING Media will give insights into the creative language skills used in intelligence and PR. Teachers and learners in schools will interact with the research throughout, culminating in an interactive schools Roadshow. 

The programme will transform research in Modern Languages by invigorating the subject from the grass-roots up to blue-sky research. By putting creativity at the heart of languages, it will reconnect languages with the arts and humanities while allowing their innovative force to become productive across disciplines and communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The programme will take advantage of OWRI as a unique opportunity to achieve a transformational impact on Modern Languages research in the UK. It will do so by breathing new life into a subject that has lost confidence in its identity as languages have come to be associated in schools and society with vocational skills devoid of intellectual excitement. 
The programme is predicated on a passionate conviction that languages have creativity built into them, and that this principle holds the key to achieving the urgently needed transformation - both because it motivates engagement, and because it brings innovative thinking to bear on securing the future of the subject. 
The researchers will implement a communications strategy centred on the main website and associated social media, with a wide range of impact-oriented activities. Knowledge exchange with partners will gain depth and resonance in annual conferences and related activities on four themes, with different strands taking responsibility for conceptual coordination: 
Year 1: Languages &amp;amp; Creativity (lead: strands 1 and 7)
Year 2: Creating Multilingual Identities (lead: strands 2 and 3) 
Year 3: Performing Languages (lead: strand 4)
Year 4: Global - Local: Creating a Multilingual World (lead: strands 5 and 6)
A Public Media Focus Group and a Focus Group for Digital &amp;amp; Social Media, Apps &amp;amp; Games will keep the programme in touch with modes and channels of communication. A Schools Focus Group and Careers Focus Group will involve sixth-formers and students to ensure that the programme speaks to the constituencies which are vital to its transformative success. Focus Group Workshops will involve a wider range of partners and participants.
The Steering Committee will oversee monitoring of the impact work through school surveys, and written, oral and digital feedback. 
The activities of the programme will put creativity at the Heart of Modern Languages in a cumulative process that both engages and benefits the intended audiences: policy-makers, communities whose first language is not English, the creative economy, other organisations that use languages professionally, teachers and learners.
Policy work led by strand 1 (Kohl) in collaboration with the British Council will promote dialogue across stakeholder groups to embed creativity in policy documentation on language use and language learning. This will gain an international dimension in two workshops with Pittsburgh and the US languages association JNCL-NCLIS.
Work on UK community languages will be led by strands 2 (Gosler, Park) and 3 (Maiden, Lahiri) in collaboration with the Smithsonian, BirdLife International and local and international schools, with activities ranging from crowd-sourcing projects to a primary school Multilingual Music Fest. 
The creative economy gives immediate access to the creative potential of languages. Strand 4 (Dudrah, Bullock, Curtis) will involve actors and musicians in workshops, study days, and performances that give participants tasters of Russian theatre, Lieder, and Black British and British Asian music.
The case for the social value of languages also needs to be made in the context of other forms of work with languages. Focus Workshops facilitated by Business in the Community will complement workshops that encourage young people to explore careers from unusual angles as creative writing and literary translation are put into contact with intelligence work and PR. Strands 5 (Ouyang, Hiddleston) and 6 (Reynolds, S. Park) will take the lead together with PI Katrin Kohl, who has extensive experience of languages in business contexts. 
Engagement with schools led by strand 7 (Graham, Fisher) and supported by collaboration with the Association for Language Learning will be central to the research and impact work throughout, and empirical research will use schools as research sites. A global classroom project and Multilingual Olympiad will push language learning beyond the curriculum.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3230977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Part of LinguaMania (see Engagement outcomes), audience members were asked to contribute to a sentence-by-sentence translation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone on a giant scroll.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1AA4CA3F-A08D-4F62-8CF1-6E5139B556C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The final translation incorporated 55 languages.

Professor Curtis was instrumental in helping both the production team and audiences consider the role of the novel in verse on which the opera is based: Aleksandr Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. In both a pre-season talk and a feature for the 2016 Garsington programme, Professor Curtis provided an overview of Pushkin's ambitious text. Professor Curtis also provided both a full translation and a transliteration of the libretto. Published by Garsington in a 125-page booklet, her word-for-word analysis of the text and annotations enabled both cast and orchestra to express the nuances and flavour of the original Russian in which the production was performed.
Philip Bullock shone a light on Tchaikovsky's dramaturgy, providing a talk to complement Professor Curtis's lecture on Pushkin. In a further talk, Professor Bullock gave an insight into how and why the composer chose to dramatize Eugene Onegin. He worked with the director and the conductor during rehearsals, adding historical justification to their decisions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DF972D18-F598-423D-8EA0-781698658F16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The professors' contributions helped the Director and Conductor reconcile the two texts: Pushkin's Eugene Onegin and Tchaikovsky's Evgeny Onegin.

Activities included multilingual music and theatre performances, languages tasters (including modern European languages, sign language, arabic, chinese and old Norse), tours of language objects in the museum's collection, writing workshops, bite-sized talks on language-related topics, and activities involving crowd-sourced linguistic ability. 
Attendees were asked to place a tile in one of three 'bins' to indicate their view of the event. 997 tiles were placed in the positive bin, 68 in the neutral bin and 12 in the negative bin.
In the post event email survey, 86% of respondents rated the event extremely enjoyable or enjoyable. In the survey 25% of respondents said they intended to read a book about languages as a result of their attendance, 25% would watch a documentary on languages, 20% intended to sign up for a lanaguage class, and 21% intended to find out more about the research project.
As well as being able to make free text comments in the survey, attendees were given the opportunity of writing views on postcards during the events (135 postcards completed). Comments included &amp;quot;[took away that] Languages are worth taking an interest in for their own sake... and not just for practical reasons (eg. I can use it in a job).

The talk stimulated lively response from audience. The attendance at the talk was exceptionally high for the series, and the following debate provided comments on the value and role of languages other than English. The event raised awareness among highly receptive MBA students and members of the general public about the value of languages beyond their transactional usefulness, and awareness about valuable individual competence. Also significant was the effect of strengthening collaboration with the Sa&amp;iuml;d Business School.

Under the auspices of the Network, Professor Kohl held a meeting with 10 school teachers ito discuss the facilitation of joint events between schools to create a sense of critical mass for German, and data gathering on concerns about grading, to be taken up with Ofqual.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E3C49F2-598C-42E4-8C4D-814E0B9A3122</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The meeting with school teachers has led to joint events between schools taking place, and a sense of critical mass for German being created. The mutual support between language teachers will support the sharing of innovative approaches and best practice in language teaching, leading to better student outcomes.
In addition, data has been gathered on concerns regarding assessment and grading, which will be used to inform conversations with the exam boards and Ofqual. This is important work as concern about robust assessment, support for MFL teachers in line with support for teachers in other subjects, and dependable, fair grading at A level are seen as key factors in take up and progression for Modern Foreign Languages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67c192859e3.12451100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.uk.diplo.de/Vertretung/unitedkingdom/en/11/TGN.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Speaking to a Global Future - The Languages Landscape Post-BREXIT.

At the Symposium, John Hopper, Curriculum Division, Department for Education, read the following statement on behalf of Nick Gibb MP, Minister of State for School standards: I fully recognise the importance of languages to the business world and the value to pupils in developing fluency in a modern foreign language. The government has worked hard to reverse the long term decline in the number of pupils studying a foreign language that began in 2004...This year almost half of pupils took a language at GCSE, up from 40% in 2010, but we want this proportion to be much higher. Not only are we determined to see higher language entry rates, but we are determined to ensure all pupils receive excellent language teaching. For this reason, I look forward to seeing the Teaching Schools Council's report into effective modern foreign language pedagogy.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c67faa72d023.74853853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3597a48476744ef6a59119f53/files/S2FSymposiumInvitation.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Westminster Education Forum Seminar: MFL at secondary level in England - classroom teaching, recruitment and standards.
