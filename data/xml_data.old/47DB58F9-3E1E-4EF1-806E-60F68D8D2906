This finding has transformed our understanding of human biology, through the realisation that many of the cellular and biochemical processes controlled by these genes in simple organisms also operate in ourselves. Most of our knowledge about the control of cells and organ systems has come from the study of a few so-called ?model organisms?, especially the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the tropical fish Danio rerio (commonly known as the zebrafish). Studies of such organisms have the potential to revolutionise our understanding, diagnosis and treatment of human disease, a premise that underpins the activities of the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics. A key aim of the Centre is to encourage the rapid translation of our basic research findings into clinical application. This proposal will facilitate such translation by providing the means to screen for small molecules that can modulate pathogenic processes in model organisms. Such small molecules will provide powerful tools for probing the molecular basis of these processes and in some cases will provide leads for the developments of new drugs for their treatment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics (CDBG) brings together basic and clinician scientists using non-mammalian model organisms to understand the genetic basis of human disease, knowledge that will be essential for the development of novel therapies. In recent years, several groups within the CDBG have established disease models that provide a basis for high content screens. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish a facility for, high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries using these high content biological assays with the dual aim of identifying novel reagents for continued research and the establishment of systems to speed the identification and validation of lead compounds for drug discovery. In contrast to conventional drug screening programs where efforts are focused on a relatively small number of disease-relevant target pathways and proteins, the whole organismal nature of our models provides the potential for identification and validation of reagents affecting multiple pathways in the pathogenic process. A second application of the facility will take advantage of more conventional tissue culture based assays that are currently being devised for use in RNAi screens. The shared Screening Facility will have the flexibility to accommodate many different types of assay. Individual researchers will carry out the vast majority of work for their own screening projects (see CDBG component outline applications), but the Facility will provide the capacity for integrated management and automation of assay protocols and for access to business and pharmaceutical pipelines. Further, the Facility will enable and underpin future translational needs that lie at the heart of the University?s strategic vision: as functional genomic/proteomic datasets of patient-based materials accumulate in the Academic Medical Centre, these will integrate with the information from high throughput screens from cell-based and animal model systems in the CDBG. The Facility will therefore support a bidirectional flow of information, integrating mutually informative data from basic and clinical platforms.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Karus Therapeutics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>HDAC inhibitor screen in Zebrafish [Karus Therapeutics] (VC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>18CB8B57-FCF0-4497-AF7F-3D1F31FAC869</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NA</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>Cqmo3ygdjzG-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Characterisation of novel HDAC inhibitors as potential anti-epileptic drugs using molecularly focused screen in zebrafish.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Characterisation of novel HDAC inhibitors as potential anti-epileptic drugs using molecularly focused screen in zebrafish.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nikon</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Customized microscope (SB)</gtr:description><gtr:id>5832569F-ECD8-48F2-B471-BD601CE1CABB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NA</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>dkGha4H5AAR-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborated to produce a customized microscope for automated imaging of bright field and fluorescent images in multiwall plates.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaborated to produce a customized microscope for automated imaging of bright field and fluorescent images in multiwall plates</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>ASH Biotech</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development of new equipment to increase throughput of drug screening methods in zebrafish (SB)</gtr:description><gtr:id>57ADD69B-8EB5-4D41-B475-BEF8726E4F55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Beta versions of two pieces of equipment are being evaluated.

The Data Organisation System (DOS) accepts raw images as produced by optical scanning equipment (primarily microscopes purchased through this award) as input and using an agreed code embedded into the filename or external metadata file. 

This award inspired the inception of a high performance data storage system in a collaborate effort between researchers from the MRC- CDBG, the Welcome Trust funded RNAi Facility and the Light Microscope Facility. The award used this hardware to implement an advanced file archiving / indexing system based on file fingerprinting such that only links to files are stored in the database and the files are stored on disk. Should the original files move then relinking them correctly in the database is a trivial matter.

In the prototype system researchers can view loaded images and assess the images as to whether the result is considered a 'Hit' or whether the compound was considered toxic. The structure of the database has been designed such that all results are attached to a central unique combination of Screen-Plate-compound for library-Well. This allows the database to record more complex quantitative parameters (eg. Fluorescence intensities, absence of fish features, links to external analyses).

Details of the compound libraries used for screening are loaded into the database with annotation pertinent to it stored for easy retrieval. 

A guiding principle of the database is that all the data either loaded in or collected by the interfaces (WWW, SQL access) is stored in flat files as far as is possible and that the entire database can be rebuilt from this using computer code. This allows ease of data integration with other external analysis packages and data entry using familiar spreadsheet interfaces. Template Spreadsheets have been constructed for this purpose that include rudimentary data validation.

Further different screens can then be linked together to form 'Investigations' such as primary screen, confirmation of Hits in a smaller replicate screen, a follow-up secondary screen and similar alternative results found in literature searches.

Software has been developed based on practical experience gained in the laboratory to identify problems in the library annotation (e.g. multiple compounds listed in the same well, duplicate compounds present, consistency checking of library rearrangements) and present these for further investigation / correction. 

The chemical structures of compounds in the library are being compared to both each other in the same library, to those in other libraries and publicly databases to identify similar compounds, allow decisions about the overlap in libraries and to improve annotation respectively. The analysis continues but there are clearly patterns within the comparison even when simple atoms connectivity is considered using Open Source Cheminformatics packages (OpenBabel) implementing classical distance measures. Through a collaboration at Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) an optimally ordered heatmap using specialist software they have access to group compounds together into meaningful clusters has been prepared in preliminary form. This is useful for giving insight to non-domain specialists as to the relationships between compounds contained in libraries.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5CC23A3D-21FC-455E-A5EA-18C2D1ADCE40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Support of scientific screens internally.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>ADHYRDCgc1Q</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A data repository for high throughput screening data (MM)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This protocol uses mesh bottomed plates (Millipore) throughout; from the addition of the drug, through the in situ hybridization machine (Intavis) and the image capture on a customized Nikon microscope.
