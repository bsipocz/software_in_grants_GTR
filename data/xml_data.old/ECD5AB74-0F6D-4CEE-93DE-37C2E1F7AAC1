Views on dying, death and the afterlife can influence attitudes towards pain relief for terminally ill people, means of determining the moment of death, brain death, organ donations and care for the corpse'. Thus, perceptions borne of faith or belief are a pervasive and essential aspect of health care and health care law. Indeed, the very political and legal acceptance of novel biotechnologies in themselves may be profoundly influenced by faith and belief perceptions, including in relation to stem cell research/therapy, creation of animal/human hybrids, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, sex selection, genetic enhancement, etc. The operation of laws will in turn be affected by individuals' and communities' views of how their faith and beliefs determine their engagement with health care, including those of health practitioners. Some of these have enormous public health ramifications, such as organ donation and vaccinations. There is, for instance, an established correlation between levels of willingness to agree to donate organs for transplantation and features of faith or belief; although the extent to which cultural or social factors are the primary motivating influences is itself something which we wish to investigate in this and other contexts. The Organ Donation Taskforce and House of Lords Select Committee Reports have both recently emphasised the vital nature of further research in this area. \nThe extent to which the views of individuals influenced by faith and belief may be catered for by laws and legal processes is a crucial feature of policy formulation, whether in relation to their own or another's (perhaps their own child's) treatment. These aspects are most obviously seen in relation to issues of circumcision, immunisation, contraception, abortion, refusals of medical treatment e.g. blood transfusions, etc. Freedom of religion/belief and equality are interests which nation states must balance against others in formulating policy. The issue of conflicts of duties and belief-based exemptions for health practitioners is also highly charged, raising questions as to the legitimacy and limits of such legal exemptions (including whether some beliefs impact more fundamentally upon individuals' values than others i.e. non-faith based beliefs). The latter issue has become topical on both the domestic (see e.g. GMC, Personal beliefs and medical practice, 2008) and international stages (see e.g. Religion and Healthcare in the European Union: Policy Issues and trends, NEF Initiative, 2009). These interests may be impacted upon by the interpretation of statements of rights with respect to equality and non-discrimination, health or freedom of religion, e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights (and in particular Article 9), and by European Law (although currently limited there are proposals to introduce a directive prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of, inter alia, religion of belief in the context of healthcare). Moreover, general equality laws are becoming more pervasive in this sphere. Finally, although the widening participation agenda and the democratic process necessitate that the views of faith and belief groups feed into policy forums and formulation, the extent of such involvement and which communities should be accommodated are unresolved issues.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a unique and multidisciplinary proposal which will begin to evaluate the interaction of healthcare law and faith and policy perspectives and influences. The breadth of participants will ensure that new insights and areas for future study are generated and new collaborations established across disciplinary and institutional divides. The Midlands presents a particularly diverse religious and cultural area within the country and thus provides a particularly important site to locate this type of research. The aim is to particularly engage with the faith communities and health care professional community within the Midlands. The tightly drawn objectives coupled with the open-ended seminar format and methodology will encourage new thinking about an under-researched topic with broader health implications. \nThe inclusiveness of our multi-faith, multi-ethnic society is essential to the smooth running and success of the UK's healthcare system in general and to its impact on specific communities in particular. The introduction of healthcare policies and procedures are partially a function of community acceptance and toleration. The role of faith and belief in an increasingly secular society is a major challenge to policy makers and formulators. This has social and economic, as well as political, dimensions of a profound character. The effectiveness of these public services, and the participation in healthcare of all in our society with consequent improvements in quality of life, are linked to the extent to which a plurality of standpoints may be accommodated by policy and implemented by practitioners on the ground. Whilst there are limits to which such perspectives may limit the freedoms of others, these views are crucial to involvement and partnership in healthcare decision-making with healthcare professionals. Engagement with, and access to, health services and healthcare practitioners generally is an issue for some communities, and therefore the health of the nation as a whole is to a degree bound up with these issues. It has been observed for instance that ethnic minority groups may become alienated from organizations that do not treat them appropriately and sensitively (Vulnerable Groups and Access to Health Care, 2005).\nSelected papers presented at the seminars will be chosen for inclusion in an edited interdisciplinary book for which publishers' support will be sought. In addition, there will be additional major articles produced and targeted principally at high quality, internationally-rated journals with notable impact factors. These will include journals in the legal, theological, medical, biomedical ethics and social science domains. In addition, a website will be created. This will provide a resource for participants in the project through e.g. discussion forums. It will also have external facing pages which would provide public access to the research and its findings as appropriate. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The David Price Memorial Seminar Series: Law and the Regulation of New Health Technologies (The University of Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0033B2DD-E31B-4522-A572-C00F1814E2D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar held in September 2013 was entitled &amp;quot;Law and the Regulation of New Health Technologies: Religion, Faith, Belief and the Scientific Imperative: Reconciling the Irreconcilable?&amp;quot; 

Dr Amel Alghrani , Senior Lecturer in Law, Liverpool Law School, University of Liverpool gave the paper 'New Reproductive Technologies: The Entanglement between Religion and Regulation' exploring some of the critical dilemmas in relation to the legal engagement of reproductive technologies with faith and belief from their outset to new challenges across different faith perspectives. This was followed by Professor Jackie Leach-Scully, Professor of Social Ethics and Bioethics, PEALS, University of Newcastle. In her paper , &amp;quot;Faithful judgements: the role of religion in laypeople's ethical evaluations of new reproductive and genetic technologies&amp;quot; she explored some of the challenges in perception in relation to such new technologies in the light of empirical work undertaken by her team. This session concluded with Dr Peter Lund, Reader in Molecular Microbiology, School of Biosciences, and University of Birmingham. He provided the perspective of a &amp;quot;bench&amp;quot; scientist who has also been a member of a number of important regulatory bodies in his paper &amp;quot;Reflections from a Scientist.&amp;quot;

The first session in the afternoon was entitled &amp;quot;New Health Technologies and Research a Question of Faith?&amp;quot; The first paper was delivered by Dr Sheelagh McGuinness, Birmingham Research Fellow, and Birmingham Law School. In her paper &amp;quot;Mandatory or meritorious: The Legal Duties of Researchers in relation to incidental findings.&amp;quot; she explored issues arising in the context of innovative scientific research concerning genetic databases and the problems and consequences of feedback across different minority groups. Dr Shawn H.E. Harmon, Lecturer in Regulation and Risk, University of Edinburgh, explored the use of database storage in relation to brain banking an issue which has fundamental challenges in relation to those coming from different cultural and religious perspectives &amp;quot;Brain Banking: A Guiding Value for A Public Good&amp;quot;. This was followed by Professor Jean McHale, Professor of Healthcare Law, and University of Birmingham. Her paper &amp;quot;Asking uncomfortable questions? - Equality, faith and rights in research regulation. &amp;quot; asked some difficult questions concerning how recent statutory duties entrenched in equality legislation and in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 should impact upon research regulation in the future. The final session &amp;quot;Exploiting New Health Technologies: Dignity, Faith and Commerce- Truly Irreconcilable Concepts&amp;quot;. This session examined the challenges of commercial exploitation of new health technologies involving the use of human material, regulatory paradigms and fundamental issues of ethics. Two provocative and challenging papers one by Professor Roger Brownsword, Emeritus Professor of Law, University of Sheffield and Kings College London, chair of UK Biobank Ethics and Governance Council, &amp;quot;Regulatory Coherence, Human Dignity, and the Reconciling the Decision in Br?stle&amp;quot; and the second by Professor Aurora Plomer, Professor of Law and Bioethics, University of Sheffield &amp;quot;European Science, Dignity and Human Rights&amp;quot; explored both the background to the current debates and the really difficult issues which remain for future policy makers and regulators in this area in the light of recent EU jurisprudence concerning patenting and dignity. The seminar enabled participants to engage more broadly with the question of whether it is truly possible to effectively regulate such issues given the global dimensions of law, science and ethics and diverse faith, religious and moral paradigms.





This seminar was held at the University of Birmingham in September 2013.

In particular, it focused on the use of conscientious objection in the context of faith and belief issues. There were four sessions in the seminar. The first focused on conscientious objection and public values. It explored the role of conscientious objection within the public sphere as well as the communicative aspect of objections from conscience. The second session focused on a practical issue involved in conscientious objection - its role in the often controversial subject of abortion. Papers within this section focused not only on the theoretical aspects of using conscientious objection in relation to abortion choices, but also on the legal ramifications of exercising conscientious objections. The third session of the seminar concentrated on conscientious objection and its impact upon medical treatment generally. In the session, papers looked at the nature of proper medical treatment and the role that conscientious objections plays within that context. The final session explored how best to resolve conflicts in matters of conscience in medical treatment. How do we resolve the controversial decisions that people make and whose interests should take priority when individuals disagree over treatment options?


The delegates considered possible ways by which we can resolve the controversial decisions that people make and whose interests should take priority when individuals disagree over treatment options.
