Furthermore, such weapons could be of novel types that the intended targets could not be easily defended against. In response to these challenges the UK has played a leading role in enabling states parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to have specific measures available by which the chemical and biological prohibition regimes may be strengthened in order to reduce the threats form advances in science and technology (S&amp;amp;T) being misused for hostile purposes. Starting at the multilateral level, the key objective of this project is to help improve the operation of those aspects of the BWC and CWC by focussing on advances in synthetic biology, neuroscience, and nanotechnology, including advanced drug delivery techniques.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the key goal of the project is to contribute to an improved multilevel governance of biochemical security, the beneficiaries will include a variety of user groups ranging from the multilateral to the domestic UK governance level. The focus on different stakeholders across the different levels provides an excellent opportunity to connect these and thereby add real value. Possible non-academic beneficiaries include:
STATES PARTIES TO THE BIOLOGICAL AND TOXIN WEAPONS CONVENTION: States parties to the BWC gather regularly in Geneva to review operation of the treaty and to take into account S&amp;amp;T developments of relevance but lack either a scientific background to arrive at independent assessments, or the institutional back-up for the analysis of S&amp;amp;T advances, or both. At the 2011 BWC Review Conference S&amp;amp;T reviews have been made a so-called standing agenda item for the annual BWC meetings, but no improved infrastructure or processes have been put in place to facilitate the S&amp;amp;T review at the multilateral level.
STATES PARTIES TO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION: States parties to the CWC have the comparative advantage that the organisation to oversee implementation of the treaty has a Scientific Advisory Board as subsidiary body. However, this board is responsible to the Director General of the organisation and its recommendations have been ignored by CWC states parties on several occasions.
Thus, states parties to both of these Convention stand to benefit from this project, albeit for different reasons. Yet, in both the CWC and the BWC contexts, the importance of S&amp;amp;T reviews has been long recognised, which can be expected to provide receptive audiences for the research results. This is further supported by the fact that the G8 Global Partnership countries, which are members in both treaty regimes have recently begun to focus on biosecurity as one area of primary concern
GOVERNMENT AUDIENCES: The UK national security community has identified biosecurity concerns triggered by biotechnological developments in recent threat assessments such as the MOD's Global Strategic Trends 2040. Likewise, the horizon scanning activities of the UK government have identified developments in synthetic biology, neuroscience and nanotechnology as S&amp;amp;T areas as having potentially great implications for defence and security. In addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has identified the S&amp;amp;T dimension of the BWC inter-sessional process as a key area of interest in its counter-proliferation programme. The FCO will also be the lead department when the UK in 20013 will hold the chair of G8 Global Partnership, including its biosecurity element.
PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND LEARNED SOCIETIES: The Royal Society has long shown an interest in the intersection of S&amp;amp;T and security issues. It has recently published the third module of its Brainwaves series in Conflict, Security and the Neurosciences. Learned societies and their members will benefit from this project due to its analysis of some of the practical measures that are being discussed in the CBW prohibition regimes, such as awareness raising and education and outreach on biological and chemical security to the S&amp;amp;T communities. An early awareness of these proposals will enable the scientific community to engage during the formulation of policy measures. 
PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY FUNDED RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS: Advances in the life sciences that could become a security concern are widely distributed across publicly and privately funded research institutions. As many of the governance measures discussed in the multilateral context will directly affect such research institutions, they will benefit from the awareness raising elements of this project. 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC: This includes those members of the public with an interest in S&amp;amp;T, security issues, or both. Making project results available to the public will enable a wider discussion of S&amp;amp;T and security perceptions and opportunities for cooperation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration between Bath and the Unviersity of Sussex.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C9F6FC7F-5104-4A93-84E8-40A345FACE56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration with the ESRC/Dstl funded project, University of Sussex .

The aim of the meeting was to examine how new intiatives could be developed at regional (south-west) UK level to improve innovation biochemical security.

During the talk there were several key areas of agreement, and some provisional findings from this meeting included: the idea that innovation security policy is developed and implemented in quite different ways in different university contexts 
a range of local, regional and national networks (both formal and personal) already exist which address which are relevant regional innovation security policy 
there are a number of potential ways by which institutional innovation security policy could be more forward looking; for example it was suggested that there was need for greater security consultation when new laboratories were being designed and built 
greater engagement with the scientific community, as well as education initiatives directed at this community would be of value to many of the stake-holders 
that regional biochemical security networks could serve a number of potential roles and had support from many of those in attendance.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cc7be3e2b24.95485248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/polis/news/news_0077.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SIde event organised at the Meeting of States Parties, Biological Weapons Convetion 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0CE53532-4DA0-4EB7-B3BF-408F0133CF8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provisional findings from our research as well as a report on our first project meeting were presented at an event which we organised by us at the UN Biological Weapons Convention Meeting of States Parties.

This has been achived through project embedded empirical research, which will result in a total of 12 policy papers. These papers have been actively distributed through mail, blog articles, news articles and meeting attendence. We are confident therefore, that these reports will inform policy over coming years. 

We have also organised three international conferences and facilitated two other events; Including a side event at the the UN Biological weapons convention and a policy event at the society of biology. Our project involved active engagement with practitioners and experts at our meetings; and through theses partnaerships we have developed a series of pratical reccomendations in our policy makers series. We have also acted as a facilitator of policy development through our international conferences. At our Novemeber 2014 meeting, for example, participants will be encouraged to feed back on an updated version of research council policy on dual-use research. Our website has also facilitated public discussion of chemical and biological weapon issues. Our page has had over 6,500 hits, we have recived comments via or comments section, and our twitter handle has over 200 followers.

This regime incorporates international organisations, as well as national and local level capacities. At international level our project has produced a series of reports which have made recommendations directed at diplomats involved in the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions. These recommendations have focused on specific challenges which are driven by development in Science and technology. This includes for example security concerns raised by the field of synthetic biology as well as the continued development called 'less-than-lethal' weapon technologies, and weapon delivery systems which are relevant to the biological and chemical weapon conventions. In addition papers in our series have also assessed the current processes of Science and technology review within the two conventions.

In addition to this our project has brought together local, national and international policy makers and implementers to discuss means of making existing systems of security and safety governance more responsive to emerging and future security challenges. This was at a Meeting in May 2014. 

At our most recent meeting we had a particular emphasis on examining how local level experience, can inform, and are informed by policy at national and international level. In particular this meeting focused on new means and forums to discuss and develop best practices in this issue area. A key focus was the potential role of local level networks to support and develop existing collaborations in this area. Many of the ideas raised at this meeting have informed further research into existing practices in a university context which are relevant to chemical and biological biosecurity within innovation. This includes for example, the role of university health and safety in laboratory safety and security as well as the role of university ethics bodies. 

In 2014, our project also sponsored a panel at the International Studies Association Conference, which was held in Toronto.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The team are collaborating with DSTL and academics in the UK and US for a further workshop to be sponsored by the Wellcome Trust on responsible biochemical innovation.
