The network will uniquely bring these scholars together with archivists and those engaged in an educational and heritage capacity in museums and prisons over a series of seminars, sustained through an web-based network resource. It aims to bring together scholars, researchers and heritage and penal stakeholders who are invested (academically and/or professionally) in 'Our Criminal Past'. However, this network is innovative in that its focus will be to concentrate on the future of our criminal past. Thus 'Caring for the Future' of the history of crime is fundamental to the network discussions, collaborations and outputs, both during the scope of the funding bid, and in the future. 

The creation of the network is in recognition of the growing importance of 'Our Criminal Past' not only to academics but also to archives, heritage professionals, educationalists and other in the wider community who have an investment in how 'Our Criminal Past' is to be preserved, presented and transmitted. Through the sharing of good practice, the bringing together of expertise, this network will provide both innovation and value for money in its potential for strategic research planning and future collaboration. 

The network will explore three inter-related themes: Digitisation, New Social Media and the Future of Our Criminal Past; Educating Historians of Crime: Classroom, Archive, Community: Representing Penal Histories: Displaying and Narrating the Criminal Past. Our intention is to create a dynamic network by developing a website, holding three one-day seminar/workshops and creating and maintaining a database of crime and penal history collections. 

The aim is to enable a forum for discussion and debate about future research directions, the sustainability of research in relation to new technology and funding-streams; the role of individuals, communities and institutions in shaping and preserving our criminal past. By bringing together academics from a range of disciplines (history, criminology, education, tourism, cultural studies) with archivists, educationalists, librarians, heritage practitioners, the network and the activities will provide a forum from which to explore ideas that could lead to new projects in and resources for the history of crime. The themes have been identified as important areas of cross and multidisciplinary interest in terms of existing, current and future research and as themes that have contemporary and cultural significance beyond the academy. 

The first theme will explore technological developments which are increasingly impacting on histories of crime. As well as exploring the priorities and futures of digitisation and role of new social media (such as blogs, facebook, twitter) it will consider the priorities and realities of funding the preservation and presentation of histories of crime. The second theme addresses the history of crime as an educational resource, recognising that education, in schools, in universities, in museums and archives and in penal institutions, is a powerful medium with the potential to influence the future shape of communities and their institutions. The third theme explores the specific presentation of crime history in museums, seeking to develop dialogues on the variation in practice and policy in cultural institutions. As academics involved in the research and publication of the history of crime we are uniquely placed to address these themes in a comparative and interdisciplinary context. The network, through the seminar days and website, will develop a broad intercultural dialogue on the preservation and presentation of histories of crime and its future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research network?

The research network will contribute to academic debates on crime and punishment history and the digitisation of criminal and social history records more broadly but its specific benefit is in the collaborative exploration of ideas with those working to preserve and present crime history for future generations. Therefore the key aim of the specialist research network is to ensure the participation of the public sector and third sector, particularly those working in museums, libraries and archives and this group will be the main beneficiaries. In addition we also hope to widen public engagement through existing relationships with local history societies, specialist crime history societies and through working with archives, museums and libraries to enable an innovation and unique platform for collaborative engagement.

How will they benefit?

In the short term, these groups will benefit through engagement with the seminars, knowledge exchange with each other and with academics. In the medium to long term, we would like to encourage better working relationships and the working together of these groups with colleagues in Universities to facilitate dissemination of crime history research to encourage wider public dissemination. Previous successful applications to the ESRC by Godfrey (on habitual offending, for example) and current project (Johnston, Godfrey &amp;amp; Cox - The costs of imprisonment: a longitudinal study, RES-062-23-3102) have arranged workshops to further public engagement. A workshop at Keele in November 2009, for example, was attended by members of local history societies, police officers, and local magistrates. The Co-I has previously organised a highly successful one-day event with the London Metropolitan Archives on 'Researching Criminal and Prison Lives' in February 2012, about 40-50 people attended (for example, students, archivists, family historians, public) and the Principal Development Officer (Jan Pimblett) for the archives is keen to work with us again. Thus we have a track record in targeting user and beneficiary groups in order to enhance impact. 

The present network will develop and expand upon existing and new relationships with the user groups outlined above by the creation and enhancement of the website, throughout and beyond the bid period. This will contribute in the longer term to the preservation, presentation and dissemination of crime and punishment history in archives, museums and galleries for future generations - contributing more broadly to the 'care for the future' of 'Our Criminal Past'. 

Our plans for the enhancement of the website (supported initially by technical assistance; see Justification of Resources) will enable and encourage the engagement of all beneficiaries in order to achieve impact. To ensure the participation and continuing involvement of key speakers and invited participants to each event the creation of the website will provide to be the most accessible means by which we disseminate and engage with those within the archives, museums and libraries sector, as well as the wider media, policy makers and charitable organisations who have expertise on contemporary and historical crime and criminal justice matters. A user-friendly website will also appeal to a much broader public audience in the short and the longer term. We will foster positive relationships with the organisations mentioned here (London Met Archives, Galleries of Justice), who engage with the broader public (for example, teachers, family historians), which has significant potential to increase impact in the longer term. An innovative aim of the network will be to solicit the feedback and opinions of former works and inmates of the criminal justice system. The collaboration with expert commentators and penal professionals (see Case for Support) through the network seminar days and website has the potential for innovative and creative impacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24630</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our Criminal Past: Representing Penal HIstories: Displaying and Narrating the Criminal Past</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EFFBF11-62C8-4821-B773-83D6A7DAE127</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The third event was held at the Gallieries of Justice, Nottingham, on 31st January 2014, with the title, Representing Penal Histories: Displaying and Narrating the Criminal Past. Speakers and delegates were drawn from academic disciplines, archives and penal museums/heritage sites. 50 delegates attended on the day. However, discussion continued via social networking sites (twitter) both during and after the day to wider audiences. The focus of the day was to consider the representation and presentation of penal histories. This was discussed through the fora of academic research into the presentation of dark tourism, the role of public engagement in the commercial heritage sector, and the future development of academic crime heritage projects in relation to fast-moving agendas relating to digitization and public engagement and participation. The event was structured around three sessions, Displaying Our Heritage, Punishment and Penality: New Directions, and Representation and Presenting Penal and Policing Histories. In the first session, three speakers from the museum sector addressed a range of issues relating to the ethical, moral and social presentation of crime history. Community was a central theme in these papers, primarily in relation to education but also more broadly in terms of how local people engaged and used crime collections. The session that followed, 'Punishment and Penality: New Directions' focused on two large academic projects funded by, respectively, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. The third session was organised around the theme, 'Representing Penal and Policing Histories'.

As a result of this event the CI (Dr Helen Johnston) was asked to submit a reflective piece on recent prison closures and crime history for the practitioner journal, Prison Service Journals. The network has also been invited to be involved in an event about the future of the recently closed Canterbury Prison, organised by network member, Dr. Maryse Tennant. As a result of this activity, the Centre for Culture and the Arts, at Leeds Beckett University, will be providing funding to support participation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1678572503.55051140cd5260a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ourcriminalpast.co.uk/event-archive-3/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our Criminal Past Twitter Feed</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>05EE5E12-5A12-461D-A86E-F248ECEF7842</gtr:id><gtr:impact>currently followed by 900 academic, professional practitioners and public

Twelve people attended the session, which included teachers, educational professionals and archivists. This session provided an introduction to 'Our Criminal Past', a new interdisciplinary research network of UK-based scholars working in the field of the criminal, legal and penal history of Britain. The intention of the network is to uniquely bring these scholars together with those engaged in an educational and heritage capacity in museums and archives over a series of seminars, sustained through an web-based network resource (http://www.ourcriminalpast.co.uk/). 



A key strand of the network has been to discuss Educating Historians of Crime: Classroom, Archive, Community, addressing the history of crime as an educational resource, recognising that education, in schools and other institutions, is a powerful medium with the potential to influence the future shape of communities and their institutions. In this session we welcomed the input of teachers and educationalists who have a views and ideas on teaching children about 'Our Criminal Past'. In the session we asked for feedback about future event which will bring academics and teachers together to develop resources which will engage children, and particularly those children who are 'hard to reach', with the history of crime.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5453bdb58072c8.41358468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.schoolshistoryproject.org.uk/News/index.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rhiannon Pickin blog post, Our Criminal Past</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1906FE81-AF1F-40EE-B3C4-AF03736FE53C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rhiannon Pickin (Leeds Beckett University), Experiencing Crime and Punishment: Emotions, Perceptions and Responses to Crime and Penal Heritage in Courtroom and Prison Museums', 21st March 2016, posted on Our Criminal Past, tweeted to a wider audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b93e2117ccc2.76254869</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/school-of-cultural-studies-and-humanities/our-criminal-past//blog-archive/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our Criminal Past - research networking scheme - ESRC Festival of Social Science</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>708C0F00-06B8-4E14-9EF6-B657F8813992</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our Criminal Past was one of the research networks featured at the ESRC Festival of Social Science events, at the Wilberforce Institute for the study of Slavery and Emancipation, Hull. the idea of the events are to inform and contribute to the public awareness of the social science and interdisciplinary research.

2. It has done this both through a series of events, but also through maintaing a presence on social media (website www.ourcriminalpast.ac.uk; twitter-feed: @ourcriminalpast). Social media has generated interested beyond the normal academic networks. This is particularly demonstrated in our involvement with the CaP network (Crime and Punishments Collections) and with the Schools History Project, and Ben Walsh of the HEA.

We have been pleased to note the significant interest from and enhanced knowledge exchange with, archivists and heritage professionals. Meetings and collaboration between academics and such professionals have already arisen out of the events. For example, the PI attended a CaP (Crime and Punishments Collections) meeting in March 2014 (see below). The CI has submitted a short article on the history of prison closures to the Prison Service Journal (see publications). The CI and PI were also invited to give a paper to teachers and educationalists at the fringe session of the Schools History Project Conference at Leeds Trinity University in July 2014 (see Engagement Activities). Key areas of interest are in the further and deepening collaboration between higher education and schools education (see below); the place and role of social media, both in academic practice, but also in the dissemination of crime history research; the issue of ethics in relation to some of that dissemination. Since 2015, the PI was nominated to the role of secretary for the Crime and Punishment Collections Network. In this role the PI works closely with curators and other heritage practitioners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PI and CI are currently involved in the planning for an event to be called the Canterbury Heritage Symposium, which will take place early in 2015. The event will bring together academics with museum and heritage practitioners to discuss the future of the site of the former Canterbury prison. The event will focus on the importance of conserving and researching the history of the prison and ensuring that this is represented both to students and the wider community. Dr Maryse Tennant, a network member, is the main organiser and approached Our Criminal Past: Caring for the Future, to be involved in the planning and delivery of the event. The PI and CI have also had discussions with Ben Walsh, the deputy president of the HEA, about a future event involving schools, academics and archivists, to share resources and to develop knowledge exchange and public engagement. The PI and CI are currently developing collaborations with Hull History Centre, Preston Park Museum and Abbey House Museum, Leeds, for future events.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ED62F5AA-89BE-47CC-A2BA-DDEDF7E1CAA1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5444ef2ab8f622.73086298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ourcriminalpast.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFB3B7AE-AE23-4AA1-A5BC-AEBD6BF70AC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prison Closures: Thinking about History and the Changing Prison Estate</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Prison Service Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a99bd55f0d9f0eab36901a63c1799fff"><gtr:id>a99bd55f0d9f0eab36901a63c1799fff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnston, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5453bfbc8d25f1.29712292</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>284205D9-C4D8-4AF5-BB91-96B9A15486FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Our Criminal Past: Caring for the Future - Special Edition</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Law, Crime and History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/76b6655910440693e9c32a288c14115f"><gtr:id>76b6655910440693e9c32a288c14115f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shore, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5453c098ee45b9.19952771</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K005766/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2ABF7A73-38A2-4394-B71D-0AAF27E24D79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminal Law &amp; Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
