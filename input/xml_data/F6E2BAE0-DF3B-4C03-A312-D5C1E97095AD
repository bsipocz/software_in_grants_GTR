&lt;p>The network goals include: &lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>an examination of contemporary reproductive trends from different perspectives (social, psychological and biological) to generate an Integrated Model of Reproductive Motivation and Success (IMRMS); 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>identification of innovative quantitative and qualitative longitudinal methods to test the IMRMS model in couples currently deciding/trying to conceive to identify true causes of contemporary reproductive trends; 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>discussion and debate about the ethical and policy implications of the IMRMS model and what (if anything) can or should be done to influence individual efforts to conceive and/or to increase the success of reproductive efforts. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The 24 member network will work continuously for 12 months and will meet three times to achieve consensus about each of these goals and to develop grant applications to support further interdisciplinary reproductive research. The network outputs will be a dedicated interactive website, articles, policy reports, and grant applications.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142321</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Copenhagen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ESHRE Reproduction and Society Task Force</gtr:description><gtr:id>2090BB6F-C18E-49C8-86C4-CB7BFF3C9DCC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10.1093/humupd/dmr040</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461d0122e4f18.40885739-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The review of the consequences of delayed parenthood, in support of the aims of the ESRC Fertility Pathways.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The ESRC Fertility Pathways facilitated the collaboration between Lone Schmidt and Tomas Sobotka, who are members of the pathway.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>World Health Organization (WHO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sheryl van der Poel, World Health Organization</gtr:description><gtr:id>413C8B2B-25CC-4C5A-95E8-1FEE37C53B56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration has started in September 2014, no outputs yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461ce09a505d9.85193821-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The WHO has provided a Work Performance Package (funding) to support the work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The goal is to adapt a fertility awareness tool for low resource countries.

Concerted government effort has already been deployed to introduce policies that address work-life balance and deficits in childcare, considered to be important causes of delayed childbearing. However, our recent international survey of 79 countries showed that fertility knowledge of Japanese participants was the poorest among developed countries (Bunting, Tsibulsky, Boivin 2013, from ESRC Network). It was proposed that this lack of fertility knowledge could also play a role in low fertility in Japan. The project was to support the adaptation of the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale for Japan and carry out a public health survey to document in greater depth fertility knowledge in Japan.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Planning for a healthy pregnancy</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A373877-3951-4643-B3FA-3BFF86F3D42B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.02.011</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546217bbbc9fa8.79191688-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof Macklon provided input about periconceptional healthcare and Merck Consumer Health Care paid for the survey in four countries.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Professor Nick Macklon was a member of the ESRC Fertility Pathways Network.

The WHO, a member of the fertility Pathways group, was particularly interested in addressing this disparity in knowledge. My role on the 'Consultation group on the development of a country assessment tool for integration of infertility care services' concerns how best to integrate 'fertility knowledge and awareness' activities as per the initial research within the country assessment tool. Once developed this tool will be distributed internationally.

The WHO (Department of Reproductive Health Research and HRP Document team) is also adapting the fertility awareness tool based on the evidence from the IFDMS survey in low resource countries showing low levels of fertility awareness.

In our systematic review there were &amp;gt;25 determinants of childbearing (e.g., mainly demographic) but there remained a lack of clarity about the degree of influence of these factors on starting families. Our online survey (International Fertility Decision-Making Study [IFDMS], N=10,045) and literature review concurred that people require increasingly more time to feel ready to conceive. This body of work led to the proposal of a multi-factorial model for childbearing. 

People do not seem to be aware that their behaviour jeopardises their parenthood goals. Our pilot work on the planning fallacy suggested that people might not realise that a long deliberation period comes at the potential cost of not achieving parenthood. A pilot study on fertility awareness using FertiSTAT (n=612) showed that young people were not behaving optimally in regards to their fertility (e.g., smoking) suggesting a need for fertility policies directed at tackling the causes of sub-optimal fertility behaviour, which led to a new collaboration with the WHO. Further international work showed that in some countries fertility knowledge was so poor that fertility was indeed jeopardised (e.g., Japan).

Our feasibility/acceptability work indicated that all recruitment methods for research on childbearing (e.g., media, social research panels, Facebook, Google Adwords) presented some biases. One needs to be mindful of these biases but having done so; data quality was high, costs reasonable and methods effective in generating cross-cultural comparisons of people currently trying to conceive (which is a typically difficult population to reach) including low resource countries. 

From an ethics perspective nudging people in the right direction to increase their likelihood of achieving parenthood good is acceptable, provided people know they are being nudged. If policies are not transparent and people denied certain options to increase adherence to politically valued positions (e.g., at home mothers highly valued so childcare not publicly funded before the age of 5 years) then one can argue that such nudging infringes on individual rights.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Related to the principal network goals:

Starting families is a complex and protracted process, very dissimilar to family building experiences in past decades. The model building work started a dialogue aimed at disentangling biological, individual, couple, social, societal and environmental influences and organises key indicators into a working model. However, future research needs to test the direct and indirect explanatory links proposed. This work also made clear a dearth of research on planning for parenthood in some groups, for example families from low resource countries or individuals in non-traditional groups (e.g., gay and lesbian). A further gap is lack of fertility awareness, people know very little about fertility which means decision about whether and when to conceive are not informed decisions. Several of the studies part of the grant were related to fertility awareness but more needs to be done on how fertility knowledge impacts childbearing goals.

The methodological work done for the network made more salient the difficulty of identifying people trying to conceive spontaneously because these people are not always aware that they are trying to conceive, do not belong to groups that could be targeted and often change status too quickly for practical research follow-up (i.e., triers become pregnant quickly). The large scale survey did show however, a catchment period from about age 28 (near median age of first birth) where people (men and women) can become more interested in research on planning for childbearing. 

The ethical review identified that most of the ethical review in this research is around (direct, indirect) financial policies to incentivise fertility, with much of it not evidence based. However, policies often miss their mark of encouraging those prevaricating on parenthood goals and instead reinforcing further behaviour of those already on parenthood tract. 

Related to starting a network (as per UIBEN PI recommendations):
? the importance of choosing participants (co-investigators, other members) carefully, covering, for example, those with complementary skills, those whose work is familiar, those with genuine interdisciplinary interests and capability (avoiding topic 'ownership' by one discipline), and having a good mix of experienced and earlier career researchers
? the importance of 'getting away', especially early on in a project, in an informal, social setting to help bring down barriers and aid communication
