The UK government recognises the importance of the sector and its potential to contribute to economic growth and published 'A Strategy for Future Retail: Industry and Government Delivering in Partnership' in 2013. A UKCES report (Vokes and Boehnke, 2014) highlights key themes for the sector including attracting talent, image of the sector (as employers), employee retention and progression and employee issues relating to technological innovation/change. 

A great deal has been written about diversity and inclusion, and prior to that equality and equal opportunities, in the business, academic and public policy domains. Yet much of this literature focuses on the negative effects of inequality or lack of diversity or on making the business and moral case for adopting diversity policies and relating diversity to organisational performance. While this has been a worthy focus, what is lacking is a clear understanding of the processes involved in bringing about a major programme of organisational change in a large company or public sector organisation and understanding what it is that makes diversity policies actually work and achieve the desired results.

The research focus on a major British retail company who are collaborative partners with the University of Leeds provides a unique opportunity to access a large organisation during a period of strategic change. The proposal has been user-led with the research objectives and topics being discussed and agreed with the company and emerging from an initial exploratory study commissioned by them with members of the research team.

Using a case study approach focusing on the company, the team will investigate diversity and inclusion in relation to a number of Human Resource (HR) issues: retention and inclusivity, career success, progression and development and the intersectionality of protected characteristics under UK legislation (The Equality Act, 2010). The research objectives cover these topics. 

The research design uses mixed methodologies including face to face interviews with employees, HR staff, directors and senior managers. There will be a shadowing/observation study with regional teams in the company. Survey data will be collected at two intervals.

The research team will analyse the data on an ongoing basis throughout the longitudinal study, with themes emerging and building as the data grows. This organic process will mean that the company will be provided with interim reports on the findings at various stages along the way. 

DELIVERABLES SUMMARY
1) Direct benefits for the employees, senior management and Directors of the company. Research findings to be shared in a business-friendly manner with regular presentations and full involvement of the company in the process
2) Generalizable findings to be disseminated through academic channels: research conferences and seminars, journal articles and business channels: business conference presentations and seminars, business networks, institutions (e.g. 30% Club, 2% Club, Women in Business), Executive Education and teaching
3) Policy engagement including a parliamentary briefing and an event targeted specifically at policymakers. Proactive use of the key findings to stimulate progress in all sectors</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Diversity and inclusion are important issues across many fields and have never been more so in the labour market than now as companies, in particular, face many competitive challenges and changing market environments. The drive for competitiveness is especially acute in the retail sector with many global players challenging British retailers both at home and abroad. As a result of this many businesses recognise the need to attract the best possible talent and engage in organisational change to facilitate this. 

The focus of the research on diversity and inclusion is timely as large employers increasingly recognise that there is a gap between organisational policies and the experiences of employees at work. The lack of diversity in top management positions is becoming glaringly obvious. The problem is even more acute where an employee encounters barriers and discrimination for multiple reasons - referred to as intersectionality, defined as &amp;quot;the mutual reproduction of class, gender, and racial relations of inequality&amp;quot; (Acker, 2006). The definition of intersectionality used in this proposed research will include any of the protected characteristics under UK equality legislation.

The research area offers great potential for the generation of new knowledge and given its importance to people in their daily working lives it has considerable potential for broader societal impact. By working with one of the UK's top companies and harnessing the support of an influential project Advisory Board, the findings of the research will lead directly to strategies and policies that will bring about change. In this respect, the project supports the ESRC's commitment to knowledge exchange and encouraging collaboration between researchers and the private, public and civil society sectors supporting growth and innovation (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/collaboration/knowledge-exchange/index.aspx). 

The research will have significant direct influence on the partner company where the team have unparalleled access to a large and significant British company. The partnership is highly innovative in that it is both collaborative and utilises an action research model. There is also a long term commitment to the sustainable development of the partnership by the University of Leeds, hence the co-production of knowledge exchange will go beyond the lifetime of the project and potentially inform future collaborative projects.
 
As well as developing knowledge, thinking and practice in the retail sector, businesses in general will benefit from the outputs and this will be supported by the partner company. The team will broaden the dissemination of the findings to include knowledge exchange with a range of non-academic beneficiaries including non-retail businesses and small businesses, HR managers, consultants and policy makers. Whilst the research will be carried out primarily in a large company, the team will ensure that businesses of all sizes will have access to and benefit from the findings and will specifically tailor outputs for their needs. 

The team will use established dissemination methods to connect with audiences as well as thinking of new and exciting ways of gaining their attention through high profile events, PR and digital (social) media. Engagement with the support infrastructure at the Universities of Leeds and Bradford will facilitate knowledge exchange; this will include Executive Education. Also, the team will use external groups such as Women in Business, Business in the Community and others to facilitate the broader reach of the projects findings and recommendations. Members of the Advisory Board will open doors to fruitful engagement, and a range of different events will be used to brief and engage with the policy sector. Many of the planned events include a workshop element so that there is direct knowledge exchange and debate around the implications of the research thus going beyond simple dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>527577</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N018710/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44154EBB-A654-4E26-A79F-AB885BFC3D5F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial-Org/Occupational</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39B8C78D-8933-4158-88D3-165B9F15A254</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Leadership</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
