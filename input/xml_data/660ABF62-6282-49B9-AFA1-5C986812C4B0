- Engage and inspire a wide range of audiences. Particularly, to inspire KS3 and 4 students, to keep them engaged with science at key age when they can become switched off from science.

- Targeting the new content we develop at mobile domes allows us to engage with audiences which are traditionally harder to engage with current research, such as audiences in isolated locations and regions of lower socio-economic status. 

- Help planetarium professionals tackle some of the 'big questions' in astronomy.

- Raising science capital, mobile planetarium are very popular with schools and other local groups or in use at fairs. By providing them with cutting edge research we hope to raise science capital of the audience who attend these.

- Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects as a Career Path. Some of these clips will include personal stories of our astronomers to inspire audiences, particularly school students to show STEM as a viable and enjoyable career path. We are especially interested in making these appealing to female students (see more details in the summary).
 
These resources will all be available for free.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The content will be freely available. It will be hosted on a website which requires a login so that we can capture information about how it will be used. We will require all users to predict the number and audience type they will be presenting this to and then after a year we will ask them to feedback to us on the confirmed audiences they reached. As well as and feedback they have on the content. See more in the evaluation plan.

We are working with many existing organisations who are highly experienced in distributing free shows through different methods. These organisations include:

- The British Association of Planetarium (BAP). We have already started working with Sharron Leverment (FRAS) past President and current Project Manager at BAP. They will advertise our new clips to all their members, which includes most of the mobile planetaria community.

- We are part of SEPnet and the Ogden trust, this provides mechanisms for dissemination in the new content to universities with mobile domes through these networks. Particularly, presenting these new resources at bi-yearly conferences.

- The RoG. We are collaborating with Edward Bloomer and Tom Kerss. They have extensive expertise in disseminating previous content, which they are keen to replicate for this new content. This has included distributing through ESO, or through word-of-mouth and direct community engagement.

- The Winchester Science Centre. One of our PhD students, Janet Preston is a board member of the Winchester Science Centre.
We have been invited to present our first clips at the BAP annual conference, Glasgow September 2017.


The advertising will take place when all the clips are completed (see timeline below) and available for the community to download.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P006361/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
