The test will be able to be used by Farmers and Veterinarians to determine whether an animal has been infected with SBV in a matter of minutes and at a greatly reduced cost to the existing tests performed by central laboratories.

These tests will then be field trialled for ease of use, performance in the field and likely use by a large veterinary practice group. A secondary aim of the project is the identification of which parts of the virus are important in generating a host immune response. This information will be created as a result of the initial screening and will be able to be used in the design of the next generation of vaccines and tests for this virus. The vaccine due to be released in 2013 is a crude killed virus preparation and it is unlikely that there will be any way to distinguish vaccinated from naturally infected animals. This is likely to be a future requirement for export to non-EU countries meaning there will be a need for more sophisticated vaccine and test strategies in the near future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project's primary objective is to develop a pen-side test for Schmallenberg virus (SBV) to a commercialisation stage.

The distinct gross deformities of calves, lambs and kids caused by this virus have caused great anxiety within the farming community as well as substantial economic losses with badly affected herds suffering greater than 30% losses of expected lambs in some cases. Considering that the diary sector is worth 3 billion pounds annually to the UK economy alone and that estimated losses are likely to be in the region of 1000 pounds annually per farm (milk and calf losses), controlling this virus clearly has significant impact on UK and European agricultural output.

Enhancing quality of life: The ability to quickly and accurately diagnose disease and provide sensible advice on infection risks will also provide a psychological reassurance to farmers currently being quoted in the media as feeling fearful and traumatised either by the unknown risk to their flocks and herds or the awful experience of assisting at the birth at dozens of severely deformed fetuses. This has been an underestimated consequence of the disease outbreak but is certainly the most commented on effect by farms and veterinary surgeons.

Potential uses and timescales: The availability of quick, easy to use and cheap tests will enable rapid in-field diagnosis of disease in affected calves and lambs. This will greatly enhance the ability of veterinarians to provide accurate advice to their clients on the impacts of SBV. The test will also be able to be used to determine individual and herd immunity to the virus providing data to enable informed decisions to be made on whether the economic cost of vaccination is worth the risk of likely losses if it is not performed. The project anticipates the creation of a commercially releasable product within 2 years when the virus is likely to still be settling into its long term pattern and we anticipate there to be a market both within currently infected areas where vaccination decisions need to be made and in disease detection and monitoring in newly affected areas in Continental Europe as the viruses range continues to expand. Longer-term impacts include the generation of knowledge needed to develop the next generation of vaccines and tests to overcome trade barriers to non-EU countries that have been put in place as a result of this virus.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97028</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Association of Veterinary Students conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53C6609E-DAE4-4C23-B77A-0C5018A4228A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards
