The original research assessed the success of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as the means of settling disputes in the field of additional support needs (ASN). &lt;br />&lt;br />ADR involves negotiation between parties using mediators, and is believed to be less costly and stressful for all concerned than more formal methods of dispute resolution involving courts and tribunals. Despite the official promotion of ADR, our research found that it has not been extensively used. Most disagreements were dealt with through informal negotiation at school level, with only a minority of parents choosing to use a more formal dispute resolution route. Of those who did, the tribunal was often preferred to mediation because it appeared to provide enforceable recommendations. &lt;br />&lt;br />The purpose of this knowledge exchange project is to enhance parents? and practitioners? understanding of different types of dispute resolution, using think tanks to inform the production of a service framework guide.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Think tank 2 : how to use the tribunal constructively</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F80E55A-099E-4895-954B-4EDD5FF50148</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This knowledge exchange project aims to:

This is the second think tank in a series of three. It focuses on how to use the tribunal constructively, ensuring that decisions are made swiftly and that the process is as user friendly as possible. It also considers how advocacy can be used to support parents in accessing the tribunal.

What could be done to improve communication between parents of children with additional support needs and professionals were discussed, understanding of different types of dispute resolution was enhanced and ways in which each dispute resolution process might be used more effectively were identified.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5292848772.6420612b3dab88</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/news-events/events-archive/events-archive-2011/think-tank-2</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Think tank 1 : communicating effectively with parents of children with additional support needs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F37B40DC-775D-40E2-943A-C52BD2B646F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This knowledge exchange project aims to:

This is the first think tank in a series of three. It focuses on developing a better understanding of the communication difficulties which may arise and what can be done to build more productive working relationships between parents and professionals, using mediation where appropriate. Subsequent think tanks will consider how to use the tribunal constructively and how to engage children in ASN decision-making.

Better understanding of the communication difficulties which might arise was promoted; and things that could be done to build more productive working relationships between parents and professionals, using mediation where appropriate, were discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4332914831.42684652b43d6de</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/rke/centres-groups/creid/news-events/events-archive/events-archive-2011/think-tank-1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dissemination event: Effective communication and dispute resolution in additional support needs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11279A12-9FF0-4D3D-B3A6-5E976910AA43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following three think tanks, a final event was held in the Scottish Parliament on 23rd May 2012.

How can we work effectively with children from different social backgrounds, of different ages and with different types of difficulty?
