unravelling the role of protein post-translational modifications implicated genetically in several human diseases. We currently focus on understanding signalling pathways associated with neurodegenerative movement disorders, hypertension and cancer.
The aim of our research is to work out how phosphorylation or ubiquitylation pathway components pathways are organised, how they recognise signals, how the signal moves down the pathway to elicit physiological responses and to comprehend what goes wrong in human disease. Our laboratory employs state of the art biochemical and molecular technologies required to dissect signal transduction pathways. 
To help elaborate chemical inhibitors that specifically disrupt the signalling components that we are working with, we collaborate with the pharmaceutical companies supporting the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) and chemical biologists such as Nathanael Gray (University of Harvard). These tool compounds greatly aid with deciphering the physiological roles that signalling pathways play and establish to what extent inhibiting specific signalling networks suppresses disease.
On all of our projects we aim to collaborate with leading clinicians to ensure that our research is addressing the most important clinical issues and where possible access patient derived cells or tissues to learn more about how disruptions of pathways are linked to disease. I hope that our research and findings will facilitate other scientists? work in devising new strategies to treat disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Signal transduction is a key process within cells that enables communication between disparate targets to be translated into a physiological response. Often, when such communication is disrupted, aberrant signalling can promote disease development. 
Protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation are two key post-translational modifications that have been implicated a number of different human diseases, involving a litany of target proteins. My laboratory is focused on understanding signalling pathways associated with neurodegenerative movement disorders (LRRK2, Fbxo7, PINK1, Parkin, TTBK2), hyperstension (WNK1, WNK4, SPAK, OSR1, Cullin3 and KLHL3) and cancer (PDK1, Akt, SGK, mTOR, LKB1, ARK5/NUAK1 and AMPK).
We have devoted a significant effort to dissecting the regulation and function of signal transduction components that have recently been found to be mutated in Parkinson?s disease (PINK1, Parkin, LRRK2 and FBXO7) and Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 11 (TTBK2). Our data strongly indicates that LRRK2 regulates a protein kinase kinase or phosphatase that targets two phosphorylated residues on LRRK2 (Ser910 and Ser935) that control 14-3-3 binding. The hunt is on to identify these and/or other LRRK2 substrates and then work out how this is linked to Parkinson?s disease. 
Gordon?s hypertension syndrome is caused by mutations that increase expression of WNK1 protein kinase as well as specific missense mutations lying within a non-catalytic region of the WNK4 protein kinase. Our findings indicated that mutations in WNK1 and WNK4, induce hypertension by activating the SPAK/OSR1 kinases leading to the stimulation of NCC ion co-transporter activity and kidney salt retention. In ongoing work, we are working to elucidate the roles of Cullin3 and Kelch-like3 E3 ligase and how mutations related to Gordon?s hypertension fit into this pathway. We are also trying to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the WNK signalling pathway senses chloride levels that play a critical role in regulating its activity. 
Finally reduction of the apoptotic pathway has been implicated with misregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Several PDK1-mTOR pathway inhibitors are currently being evaluated in anti-cancer clinical trials. Our laboratory has been heavily involved in investigating and defining the roles of the PDK1 and a priority for our group will be to understand which cancers are most effectively treated with specific signalling inhibitors. We are also focused in undertsanding the roles of a group of SGK family of protein kinases that our research indicates will play a critical role in cancer and defining the sensitivity of cancers to certain kinase inhibitors that are being evaluated in the clinic.
Overall the aim of our research is to work out how these pathways are organised, how they recognise signals, how the signal moves down the pathway to elicit physiological responses and to comprehend what goes wrong in human disease. I hope that these findings will enable researchers to play the engineer in devising new strategies to treat disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5191000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic</gtr:department><gtr:description>Kevin O</gtr:description><gtr:id>D17B89FA-D728-43E0-8C2D-846ACA7A3119</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Zhang, J., Siew, K., Macartney, T., O'Shaughnessy, K.

It also led to the creation of the European Division of Upstate Incorporated in Dundee which currently employs about 50 people. The Unit's first publication on protein kinase profiling was named in 2009 by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia as Europe's most cited paper in the field of Cel Biology from 1996-2007, with over 2,200 citations.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy. From July 2003 to July 2008, the participating pharmaceutical companies were AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co, Merck-Serono and Pfizer. The collaboration was renewed for a further four years in July 2008 with five of these companies (Merck and Co leaving the consortium at this time). This collaboration was renewed for an unprecedented fourth time in July 2013 for a further four years with six pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Janessen Pharmaceutica), Merck-Serono and Pfizer. Each of the six companies pays &amp;pound;600000 per annum over the four year period. The aim of the collaboration is to help the pharmaceutical companies accelerate the development of drugs that inhibit protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases with therapeutic potential for the treatment of disease.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy. From July 2003 to July 2008, the participating pharmaceutical companies were AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Co, Merck-Serono and Pfizer. The collaboration was renewed for a further four years in July 2008 with five of these companies (Merck and Co leaving the consortium at this time). This collaboration was renewed for an unprecedented fourth time in July 2013 for a further four years with six pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Janessen Pharmaceutica), Merck-Serono and Pfizer. Each of the six companies pays &amp;pound;600000 per annum over the four year period. The aim of the collaboration is to help the pharmaceutical companies accelerate the development of drugs that inhibit protein and lipid kinases and phosphatases with therapeutic potential for the treatment of disease.

The open letter from 14 experts, including senior staff from all five of the country's main medical schools, said they had grave concerns that Scotland's world-leading biomedical and life sciences research would suffer if Scotland sleepwalks into leaving the UK.

The letter, coordinated by Sir David Carter, a former chief medical officer in Scotland, said Scottish universities did disproportionately well out of the UK's research funding system and from the UK's charitable and medical foundation grants.

Dr. Alessi's signature and viewpoints, while his own, brought to light in the general public, the potential deleterious impact a 'Yes' vote would have had upon Scottish scientific research funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5420553b4b32c4.30611311</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/23/scottish-independence-research-funding-medical-experts</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MRC-PPU Collaboration with Baldragon Academy 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CA89DB4-FBFA-4362-9892-C1300B9A9882</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Medical Research Council's Protein Phosphorylation Ubiquitylation Unit (MRCPPU), part of The University of Dundee, has prioritized public engagement in an effort to engage the general public and ensure that the research activities and breakthroughs are communicated to the community.

Press Release
Scientists have developed a new method of measuring the activity of disease-causing mutations in the LRRK2 gene, a major cause of inherited Parkinson's disease.

The team believes this breakthrough, which is published in the Biochemical Journal, could help pave the way for future development of a clinical test that could facilitate evaluation of drugs to target this form of the condition. 

&amp;quot;It's important to better understand how disruption in LRRK2 biology causes Parkinson's disease and whether a drug that targeted the LRRK2 enzyme would offer therapeutic benefit,&amp;quot; said lead study author Professor Dario Alessi from the University of Dundee.

Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common cause of genetic Parkinson's disease (~1% total cases). The most common disease-causing mutation in this gene increases the activity of the LRRK2 protein (enzyme) three-fold, which implies that the increase in activity of the protein may contribute towards the symptoms of the disease in these patients. It also suggests that drugs that reduce the activity of the LRRK2 protein (LRRK2 inhibitors) may help treat patients with this form of inherited Parkinson's disease. 

&amp;quot;Current drug treatments only deal with symptoms of the condition, such as tremors, but do not affect the progression of Parkinson's disease. An important question is whether a LRRK2 therapy might have potential to slow progression of the condition, which no other current therapy is able to do,&amp;quot; commented Alessi. 

When the LRRK2 protein is active, it stops another cellular protein called Rab10 from fulfilling its function in the body. There are many proteins in the Rab family, and a number of them have been shown to be low in number or deactivated in different forms of Parkinson's disease. The new method, which was developed using a mouse model, was established by a collaboration of researchers from the University of Dundee, The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, GSK and the University of Hong Kong. It analyses how much of the Rab10 protein has been deactivated - a process where phosphate groups are added to the Rab10 molecules by the LRRK2 protein - as a measure of heightened LRRK2 protein activity. 

&amp;quot;The prediction is that elevation of LRRK2 activity leads to Parkinson's disease, and this is now testable using our assay,&amp;quot; said Alessi. &amp;quot;The expectation is that if a sub-group of patients can be identified with elevated LRRK2 activity, these individuals might benefit most from LRRK2 inhibitors.&amp;quot;

This new experimental assay is straightforward, only requires small amounts of sample material and is suitable for adapting to analyse large samples, in contrast to current mass spectrometry technology that is more complex and cumbersome and requires larger sample sizes. 

While acknowledging that more work is needed, the researchers believe this breakthrough could help with future drug developments for patients with this form of Parkinson's disease. 

&amp;quot;I am hopeful that the new technology elaborated on in our study will greatly aide future work on defining the role that LRRK2 plays in Parkinson's disease. I am also particularly excited about the potential of the methodology we have elaborated, especially if it could be exploited to assess LRRK2 activity in Parkinson's patients and accelerate development and evaluation of LRRK2 drug candidates,&amp;quot; Alessi explained. 

The next steps for the researchers are to develop further tests to better detect and measure Rab protein deactivation and correlate elevated Rab10 deactivation with Parkinson's disease in samples from human patients. They believe that measuring the level of Rab10 deactivation, for example in human blood samples, could allow researchers to test the efficacy of new drug candidates.

&amp;quot;The identification earlier this year, by Alessi and colleagues, of Rab proteins as substrates of LRRK2 was a crucial step in unraveling the role of LRRK2 in the neurodegeneration underlying Parkinson's disease,&amp;quot; commented Professor Aideen Sullivan from University College Cork, an expert in Parkinson's disease and Editor in Chief of the new Portland Press journal Neuronal Signaling.

&amp;quot;This new study has capitalized on their previous work by developing a method that can measure Rab10 deactivation in small samples, giving an indication of LRRK2 activity,&amp;quot; she added. &amp;quot;If this method can be applied to human samples, it will be a significant step toward earlier and more definitive diagnosis of Parkinson's, a disease of steadily increasing prevalence that currently affects over 10 million people worldwide.&amp;quot;

A commentary by Dr Patrick Eyers, University of Liverpool, accompanying the research paper will be published later this month in the same journal. 

Commenting on the research Eyers said: &amp;quot;It is exciting to see how rapidly the LRRK2 field is developing. The methodology described in this paper expands the tools available to assess the effects of LRRK2-targeted drugs in Parkinson's disease models, and also potentially in samples derived from Parkinson's patients with activating mutations in LRRK2.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57b46333f18c88.09197126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Parkinson's Fundraising Musical Concert - 22/11/15</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>878B4256-1F40-41F8-9AB0-EDB9501CFD24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MRC PPU investigators (Drs.

Award-winning academia-Industry collaboration attracts &amp;pound;7 million to accelerate drug discovery

The University of Dundee has announced renewed funding of more than &amp;pound;7million from three of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies to support its Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT).

Pharmaceutical giants Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck will provide support of &amp;pound;7.2 million until 2020, enabling scientists at Dundee to continue their fundamental research in multiple therapeutic areas, including cancer, arthritis, lupus, hypertension and Parkinson's disease. This new round of funding secures 38 posts at Dundee for the next four years.

The DSTT comprises 22 research teams at the School of Life Sciences at the University, 12 of which are based within the Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU). 

Founded in 1998, expanded in 2003 and renewed in 2008 and 2012, the DSTT is the world's longest running collaboration between academic research laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry. The latest renewal means the consortium has attracted &amp;pound;58 million in funding since its inception. It is widely regarded as a model for how academia and industry can interact productively for which it was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in 2006.
 
Professor Dario Alessi, Director of the MRC-PPU, said, &amp;quot;I am absolutely thrilled that we have been able to renew this remarkable 18-year flagship collaboration with our pharmaceutical partners. This alliance has never been more important as our Dundee-based researchers are making such tremendous progress in better understanding human diseases such as Parkinson's, immune conditions and cancer. 

&amp;quot;The DSTT collaboration provides a unique platform through which our Dundee investigators and pharmaceutical companies can work together in order to launch and accelerate the early stage development of new drugs. It also provides our students and postdocs an opportunity to gain vital experience working closely with pharmaceutical companies that stimulates some of them to embark on a lifelong career of drug discovery to develop better treatments or even cures for human disease.&amp;quot;

The DSTT works to help identify new drug targets and then accelerate the early phase development of improved treatments for major global diseases. It was founded by Professor Sir Philip Cohen and Professor Sir Pete Downes, the current Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University. In July 2012, Professor Dario Alessi assumed the Directorship of the DSTT with Sir Philip and Professor Doreen Cantrell acting at Deputy Directors.

The DSTT helps the participating pharmaceutical companies to develop improved drugs that target major 'controller' proteins in the body, focusing on enzymes called kinases and components of the ubiquitin system.

The ubiquitin system is an emerging area of drug discovery in which Dundee has developed world-leading strengths, including the first method of screening for potential drugs against enzymes in the ubiquitin system in a more physiological way. The University is one of the world's largest centres for the study of kinases and the ubiquitin system, with some 200 scientific and support staff working in this area.
Dr Malcolm Skingle, Director of academic liaison at GSK, said, &amp;quot;At GSK, we believe that collaboration is key to helping convert groundbreaking science in to medicines. Working with experts outside our own labs enables us to benefit from each other's skills and experience, as well as sharing risk - which makes all partners well placed to pursue the most promising avenues of research. 

&amp;quot;We're delighted to be renewing our long-lasting alliance with Dundee, which exemplifies this collaborative approach. Working alongside scientists from Dundee, we're making inroads in our understanding of a broad range of chronic diseases, and we believe that by continuing our work together we'll be able to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in to new treatments for patients.&amp;quot;

Dr Clive Wood, Corporate SVP of Discovery Research at Boehringer Ingelheim, said, &amp;quot;We have been delighted to be a member of the consortium and work with the outstanding scientific teams in Dundee. We have gained early insights that have helped to spark in-house discussions, ideation for new therapeutic concepts and generate better understanding of new cellular mechanisms of disease. We look forward to our future work together. &amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>584eb145ba4ae3.47625091</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DE95B11-7DEF-4E7C-A206-8C0D6F202939</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post doc in lab helps out at local secondary school, 10 days a year, in giving a Science lesson</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58889a597e6900.57425622</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mythbusters Case Study for Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8317BB3E-FE3A-47CB-A03E-AACC26D3FDDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Writer from ABPI contacted Dr. Alessi to learn more about the DSTT model so that she might utilize it as an example of a successful collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and a university.

This discovery represents the first 'hub' molecule that can be regulated by different Parkinson's genes. It is also likely to lead to new methods to monitor the activity of these kinases that will facilitate the development of drugs targeting these important enzymes in patients with Parkinson's.

Nicola who herself has been diagnosed with Parkinson's and is under the care of Miratul at Ninewells Hospital then donated a cheque arising from a collection raised at her mother's 80th birthday to support research into the disease. 

Miratul said &amp;quot;we are extremely grateful to Nicola's mother and all the family for this generous donation which will be extremely important for our research studies into Parkinson's at the MRC unit&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57b46428522f44.44586768</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ppu.mrc.ac.uk/news_and_seminars/mrc_unit_news.php?year=2016&amp;month=August#n577</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Request for Comment About The Scottish Referendum - Blakeway Productions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF0AD97D-E4E6-431C-AC0D-B120ADEB4EEE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Journalist working for Blakeway Productions spoke with Dr. Alessi in an off the record capacity and for background research. as they are producing a television current affairs programme for Channel 4, focussing on the Scottish Independence Referendum.
