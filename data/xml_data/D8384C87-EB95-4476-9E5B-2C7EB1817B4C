They predict precise links between three seemingly unrelated classes of objects. These come from representation theory (in the form of modular forms), number theory (Galois representations) and algebraic geometry (motives e.g. elliptic curves). For each of these disparate objects you can determine something akin to an underlying DNA, the so-called L-function. (The most famous example of an L-function is the &amp;quot;Riemann zeta function&amp;quot;, which contains a host of arithmetic information about prime numbers). You can use this DNA to match the objects, e.g. for every modular form there should be a Galois representation with the same L-function. Establishing these links enables mathematicians to understand more deeply the properties of the objects involved and allows them to prove theorems, such as the famous example of the proof of Fermat's last theorem by Wiles and Taylor in 1994. 

Automorphic forms (examples of which include modular forms) are special kinds of analytic functions and can be studied for groups of matrices with entries in different fields. Fields are typically sets of &amp;quot;numbers&amp;quot; in which the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are defined. An example is the field of rational numbers but there are many other fields besides this. 

Much progress has been made in the theory of automorphic forms over the rational numbers (and other totally real fields) in the last two decades. This has led to successes such as the proof of the Sato-Tate conjectures for elliptic curves. This proposal wants to move to new ground in the hope that it will prove similarly fertile. New phenomena occur with Bianchi modular forms (automorphic forms for 2x2 invertible matrices over imaginary quadratic fields), a considerably different case in which previously developed tools from algebraic geometry are not applicable. This case is therefore an important testing ground for finding new techniques that could apply in the general context of the Langlands programme. 

So what techniques will I try? Recent progress in the theory of Siegel modular forms (4x4 symplectic matrices over the rational numbers) has led me to consider Kudla and Millson's theta lift. This is a construction that can be used to transfer Bianchi modular forms to Siegel modular forms. I propose to study the finer properties of this theta lift with the goal of applying it to answer questions about Bianchi modular forms. In particular, I want to prove results about their associated L-functions and Galois representations. 

Specific aims of the proposal include proving a relation between L-values of Bianchi modular forms and the squares of Fourier coefficients of the Kudla-Millson theta lifts (an analogue of a famous formula by Waldspurger); proving one direction of the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the Asai Galois representation (a result explaining the significance of the value of a particular L-function); and studying the theta lift in the context of a &amp;quot;p-adic Langlands functoriality&amp;quot; conjectured by Calegari and Mazur.

This proposal will lead to a much better understanding of Bianchi modular forms and will help other members of the large community of mathematicians working on the Langlands programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As with many projects in pure mathematics, the main benefits of this proposal will be academic in the short and medium term. Longer term, as yet unforeseen applications might be possible, as the example of elliptic curves over finite fields and their use in public-key cryptosystems on the internet or in mobile devices shows. The pathway to such economic impact relies on the widest and clearest possible dissemination of the research output.

There are three groups that will benefit from this project:

1. researchers in number theory;
2. researchers in topology;
3. PhD students in both of these fields.

Researchers in number theory will benefit directly from this project by the advances in the theory of Bianchi modular forms and by the development of the Kudla-Millson theta lifts as a tool in the Langlands programme. In addition, researchers in topology will benefit via the applications of Bianchi modular forms in 3-manifold theory.

PhD students in both number theory and topology will benefit from this work primarily by learning skills and knowledge related to the research subject and exposure to a wider research community. In addition they will also attain the sort of analytical, methodical skills necessary for future careers also outside academia, thus benefitting their employability and the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Conference Grant Scheme 1</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>11326</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>650043D5-4370-4929-900C-C4331C26FB22</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448cea2a5b747.42599711</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research project studied automorphic forms and Galois representations as part of the Langlands programme, in particular, applications of a theta lift from Bianchi to Siegel modular forms. It led to an exciting application of this theta lift to the modularity of abelian surfaces (the next case beyond elliptic curves, for which modularity is known by the work of Wiles, Taylor et al.) In joint work with Dembele, Pacetti and Sengun (published in J. London Math. Soc.) we provide evidence for the Brumer-Kramer paramodular conjecture. We also give the first example of associating an abelian surface to a Bianchi modular form (as predicted by the Eichler-Shimura conjecture). 

I further proved a result on the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the Asai L-function of Bianchi modular forms. The Bloch-Kato conjectures predict that a value of an L-function (an analytic object similar to the Riemann zeta function) and a certain Selmer group (an algebraic object) attached to a Galois representation should be closely related. Examples of theses conjectures include the classical Analytic Class Number Formula and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves. Following Ribet's seminal 1976 paper there have been many results employing congruences between automorphic forms to prove instances of the Bloch-Kato conjectures. My result (submitted for publication) shows how to extend Ribet's technique beyond the case of tensor product representations.

In a third paper (submitted for publication) I applied these techniques to expose more generally the connection between the &amp;quot;oddness&amp;quot; of polarized Galois representations and a parity condition in the Bloch-Kato conjectures. Under an assumption similar to Vandiver's conjecture this allowed me to rule out the existence of even residually reducible representations in accordance with the Fontaine-Mazur conjectures.

Investigating p-adic interpolations of theta lifts resulted in joint work with Kris Klosin (submitted for publication) on the p-adic interpolation of the Hermitian Maass lift. Via pullback formulae this can be used to p-adically interpolate values of L-functions. We plan to study the application of our p-adic Maass lift to the construction of p-adic Rankin-Selberg L-functions in future work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As part of my grant I organized a workshop on Bianchi and Siegel modular forms from 14-16 July 2014 (extra funding was secured from the LMS to extend the workshop to 3 days and allow funding for PhD students). This brought together 26 researchers from different disciplines and promoted the important connections between both types of modular forms, the key point of my grant. This has led to several new collaborations. The PI has also given talks at seminars and conferences in the UK, US, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, and Luxembourg to disseminate his findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A15AB7CA-11F7-450D-ADE6-704E44975674</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448df2ab8d5e8.11480583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://tberger.staff.shef.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>414FCA47-4801-4293-AC0A-57232D392C73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oddness of residually reducible Galois representations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arxiv</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a4351eadf5ef70e924c348614c74cd3"><gtr:id>2a4351eadf5ef70e924c348614c74cd3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berger TT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c1869d51d437.33847988</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>200E555B-49EF-41E3-8D9D-71DB5F570AB0</gtr:id><gtr:title>A p-adic Hermitian Maass lift</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arxiv</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a4351eadf5ef70e924c348614c74cd3"><gtr:id>2a4351eadf5ef70e924c348614c74cd3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berger TT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dda5dde87d23.36847134</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CBFE7D2-8B1A-40C3-A79A-2A50C42A4629</gtr:id><gtr:title>Theta lifts of Bianchi modular forms and applications to paramodularity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/077e14af8696bb41a12fd00b4bde5ddc"><gtr:id>077e14af8696bb41a12fd00b4bde5ddc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berger T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5448d483f26d33.22731138</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>35E6B4FA-EF9A-45E8-BAFE-1AFCE33A2E5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the Bloch-Kato conjecture for the Asai L-function</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arxiv</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/077e14af8696bb41a12fd00b4bde5ddc"><gtr:id>077e14af8696bb41a12fd00b4bde5ddc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Berger T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>561fc50c24ae46.55710282</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K01174X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
