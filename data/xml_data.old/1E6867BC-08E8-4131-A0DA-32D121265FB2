The PROMPT feasibility project funded in 2011-2012 by the TSB successfully demonstrated a new type of biosensor based system could specifically detect MRSA under field conditions. This success has led to the PROMPT-Plus project that aims to further develop the biosensor system to fully operational point-of-care prototypes that will be tested in NHS trust laboratories.
