It's people centric; it connects an elderly person with their family, friends, and carers in a secure, private group (termed 'trusted people') that has no public invites. It encourages people to share and care for other people. It's a new mobile app for elderly people that runs on their phones and tablets and features built-in wellbeing sensors. It runs 24/7 in the background even when devices are asleep. It lets an elderly person's 'trusted people' see if they feel lonely or unhappy, and if they are up and about and moving inside their home. 'Trusted people' can receive alerts for wellbeing concerns, such as if an elderly person doesn't get up in the morning at their regular time, or they move unexpectedly in the middle of the night, or they press a SOS button. The app sensors when an elderly person leaves their home. 'Trusted people' can see how long a person has stayed at home (it could be many days), how frequently they go out, the places they go to, and how long it takes them to travel to these places. Knowing how active a person is allows their 'trusted people' to encourage greater activity (which maintains health and reduces the risk of chronic illness). There are alerts for wellbeing concerns, such as if a person doesn't return home by a certain time. The app has screens designed for ageing people to promote social interaction and a healthy active lifestyle, such as: [PEOPLE]: large text/pictures to list a person's family, friends and carers. One click to make a phone call. The list of people can be created and maintained remotely by (say) a son or daughter. [INFORMATION]: large text/pictures to list charities, neighbourhood community groups and advocacy organisations. One press to make a phone call or open a website to get access to valuable resources. The content can be maintained remotely by other people. For example, a health carer can add a picture and web link that explains to an elderly client, and their family, information about their medication and care plan. It's great for securely sharing. [ROUTINE]: used by an elderly person to click to show they have (say) taken their medication in the morning. It means their 'trusted people' can see that a person is remembering to keep to their routine. [FEELINGS]: large text/icons for an elderly person to click to share their emotion. [ALERTS]; real-time alerts to 'trusted people', e.g. if an elderly person is not feeling well, if they missed a routine, if they are not home by a certain time, appointment reminders,? [CALENDAR]: lets 'trusted people' share key dates, such as hospital appointments and anniversaries, etc. [GO OUT]: if a person clicks to say where they are going it lets other people receive alerts, such as not arrived. For family, friends and carers a [WELLBEING] screen puts all this wellbeing and sensory information together.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971494</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
