Decreased information flow, known as long-term depression (LTD), is induced in the hippocampus by the activation of group I-metabotropic glutamate receptors (GpI-mGluR), which leads through a cascade of events to the loss of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) from the synapse. Therefore, it is very important to know the identity and functional role of the proteins that are involved in the cascade of events initiated by the activation of GpI-mGluR located on the surface of the nerve cell leading to the loss (internalisation) of AMPAR also situated on the surface of the nerve cell. This process involves several steps and different proteins. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) is known to be involved in the induction of GpI-mGluR-LTD. A kinase is an enzyme which function is to add phosphate to another protein (substrate). The added phosphate activates or inhibits the function of the substrate. During GpI-mGluR-LTD, the substrates for p38 MAPK are not yet known. The aim of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that MK2, which is a direct substrate of p38 MAPK, is the missing link between mGluR-mediated p38 MAPK activation and the internalisation of the AMPAR during mGluR-LTD using a broad range of techniques. Pilot data have already found cofilin1 as a potential target of p38 MAPK during GpI-mGluR-LTD. Furthermore, increased levels in p38 MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation was also observed in mGluR-LTD. To confirm the biological function of p38 MAPK-MK2-LIMK1-cofilin1 signalling cascade, we will use primary cultures from MK2/3 and MK2 knockout mice combined with molecular biology techniques, immunocytochemistry, confocal imaging and electrophysiological recordings. First, we will use neurons lacking MK2/3 and induce mGluR-LTD to address the internalisation of AMPAR. We will also replace the phosphorylated amino acids in the cofilin1 and LIMK1 to inactive amino-acids and determine whether the replacement affects the function of the endogenous protein. For example, if the endogenous protein is involved in the internalisation of AMPAR, will the manipulated protein block the internalisation of AMPAR. AMPAR has a very important role in neuronal function and therefore in brain function. Loss of brain function, which can be caused by several factors including normal ageing, has been associated with several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus, understanding the mechanisms regulating internalisation of AMPAR will provide insight into both normal and abnormal synaptic mechanisms and may also identify novel targets to slow cognitive decline in ageing and in neurodegeneration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Modulation at glutamatergic synapse transmission is referred to as synaptic plasticity and can last for long periods of time. These long-term processes are thought to underlie learning and memory. Long-term depression (LTD) involves either ionotropic, or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) and results in a rapid and sustained decrease in excitability of the postsynaptic membrane due to the internalisation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) from synapses. The binding of group I (GpI)-mGluR by the agonist activates a cascade of proteins that leads to the activation of p38 MAP Kinase. The p38 MAPK controls the induction of mGluR-LTD leading to AMPAR endocytosis. However, the identification of direct substrates of p38 MAPK during synaptic plasticity is still missing. This proposal builds on preliminary data obtained from the use of specific inhibitors combined with novel complementary proteomic approaches and mass spectrometry which identified cofilin1 as p38 MAPK target during mGluR-LTD. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation levels of a direct substrate for p38 MAPK, MK2, is also observed in mGluR-LTD. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that p38 MAPK-MK2-LIMK1-cofilin1 cascade is the missing link between the activation of mGluR and the internalisation of AMPAR underlying mGluR-LTD. This research will make a fundamental contribution to current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms linking the mGluR-LTD mediated by p38 MAPK activation with internalisation of AMPAR. As such these findings will be of crucial importance to understand the role of neurotransmitter receptor trafficking in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is my first independent post and therefore I have been establishing my laboratory, inducting my students and generating preliminary data which has not left much time for communications and engagement work. However, I firmly believe in the importance of ensuring maximum research impact, and have skills and experience in doing this from my past career as a secondary school teacher. I have often attended the Teaching, Public Awareness and Social Impacts in Neuroscience panel sessions at the Society for Neuroscience Meetings. I believe that Neuroscience is an ideal field to spark interest in science amongst secondary school students. I also see explaining the implications of my research to third sector organizations as an important obligation. To this end, I have given talks about my research to audiences with general scientific backgrounds in programmes such as the various Doctoral Training Centres at Warwick University. As my career develops, I hope to get more involved with these and take advantage of further opportunities to be active in these important discussions around the implications of my research area. I am currently co-supervisor of a PhD student sponsored by GSK under the BBSRC industrial CASE award scheme. This has provided me with invaluable access to GSK resources and my first insight into the opportunities for collaborating successfully with industry. I aim to continue to maintain links with relevant industrial partners. In my previous role, at Bristol University, I hosted University Open Days for secondary school children to show how neurons connect to each other using animated confocal imaging. I very much enjoyed this and look forward to contributing to similar activities at Warwick. This will include giving talks to local school children, through the Researchers in Residence and existing connections between my Department and local schools. The proposed research relies on my on-going research collaborations with the MRC Phosphorylation Unit at Dundee University. As I am interested in the role played by signalling cascades underlying synaptic plasticity, my collaboration with Dr Simon Arthur has been very productive, as it provided me access to several tools in molecular biology and inhibitors. I have also established a collaboration with Prof Mathias Gaestel from the Medical School at Hanover University. This collaboration has provided access to the MK2/3 and MK2 knockout mice which he generated. Dr Yuriy Pankratov my colleague at Warwick will provide expertise for the recordings to show the characterisation of the functional role of MK2/3 cascade in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors in mGluR-LTD. The skills and experience of the three groups provide important defined specialist contributions to the progress of my research, and I therefore anticipate continuing to work with them. My research interests are centred on the trafficking of transmembrane proteins during synaptic plasticity. The outcome of my research is likely to be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry given its focus is to understand the signalling pathways involved in the trafficking of AMPA receptors during synaptic plasticity. Trafficking of AMPA receptors plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and therefore in brain function. Loss of brain function can be caused by ageing and also has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus, understand AMPA receptors trafficking will provide insights into the molecular mechanism involved in synaptic transmission and may also identify novel targets to slow cognitive decline in normal ageing and neurodegeneration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>368105</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings from this research was recently published in: Eales KL, Palygin O, O'Loughlin T, Rasooli-Nejad S, Gaestel M, M?ller J, Collins DR, Pankratov Y and Corr?a SAL.
