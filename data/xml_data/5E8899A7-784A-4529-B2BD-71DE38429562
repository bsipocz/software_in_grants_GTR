These can now be listened to as podcasts, accessed at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p33l4
The original programmes were broadcast on Radio Ulster just before news programmes at 9 a.m., 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. so the assumption is that they reached the widest possible audience on Radio Ulster, which is the most listened to radio station in Northern Ireland (and also has a large following in the Republic of Ireland). The BBC have not provided me with more detailed stats concerning the web activity or number of downloads of the podcasts and I assume that they have no mechanism by which they can easily calculate this.
I received requests to give talks at libraries in Newry and Omagh, the Ulster Museum and at the West Belfast Festival (all in Summer 2016) which were partly as a result of my involvement with these programmes. Some audience questions referenced programmes I had been involved in (notably concerning the hospital established at Queen's University Belfast and recruitment to the British armed forces).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7101044f89.23776739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p33l4</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award was an unusual one as my role was to advise BBC Northern Ireland on the 100 radio programmes they produced as part of the BBC WW1 at Home series. I was directly involved in researching and presenting six of these and acted as a consultant for the others. Some of the research carried out will appear, in due course, in a co-edited book (with William Butler and Michael Wheatley), 'Irish recruitment to the British armed forces, 1914-18' and, as a longer term project, I expect to write a history of Ireland in the First World War. I should note here that my advice on some programmes was that these were very poor, based on interviewing amateur historians with no real grasp of the subject but, in some cases, the BBC went ahead and broadcast them anyway. So while I think that input by myself did introduce some better quality control to the project, this was not as developed as it might have been. The impact on policy making was not as profound as had been hoped, as the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland seemed to frame their collective memory of the First World War around the Battle of the Somme, rather than the 'home front'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>479ECC77-0A8B-498C-866B-F34EF822DB07</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d846f1ab68c9.78478625</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The BBC Northern Ireland programmes recorded as part of this have shed light on various aspects of the Irish home front, 1914-18 which have not previously been considered by historians. In particular, work on recruiting, shell production in Belfast, shipbuilding in Belfast, medical history and the reception of Belgian refugees have been consider afresh. 
Work for these programmes showed that both of the shipyards in Belfast; Harland and Wolff and Workman and Clarke managed to produce a large number of ships during the First World War (about 12% of the UK total) diversifying their output considerably and producing a range of shallow draft monitor ships for the Royal Navy. The latter was particularly important as pre-war very few RN vessels had been produced in Belfast. While there has been much work done on Irish recruitment to the British armed forces during the Great War by the likes of David Fitzpatrick, Richard Grayson and Keith Jeffery, programmes in the series emphasised the importance of politics in Irish recruitment (Catholics in West Belfast were as likely to enlist as Unionists anywhere in Ulster) and showed the problems faced in recruiting, even in strongly Unionist parts of Ulster. The role of Belfast industry in the First World War has received very little attention, especially compared to Philip Ollerenshaw's fine study of it in the Second World War but the programme concerning Mackie's Foundry showed that this firm was able to successfully diversify into shell production and employed a large number of women workers; the latter point not fully appreciated previously as, of course, conscription was not applied in Ireland. Programmes on medical history showed the importance of Ireland as a source for mosses used in medical treatment and the role of voluntary groups, notably the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospitals, in offering treatment to wounded soldiers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A number of these programmes provided 'tasters' of topics that could form the basis of future research projects, notably Ph.D. thesis. The Northern Ireland A-Level curriculum includes an option on 'Ireland 1900-25' which a number of the programmes contribute to.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>43703AC8-1A04-4010-9EA7-83E40E1AA7E0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d84b704cba51.33603127</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p33l4</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M504063/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
