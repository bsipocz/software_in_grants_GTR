Battery charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) will increase the power demand in distribution networks and large scale electric transport will require smart management of the charging infrastructure. Depending on the location and times the vehicles are plugged in, they could cause local constraints on the grid. Analysis tools are required to determine the effects of adding a large number of mobile EVs to the grid, as well as the customers' location, charging time and duration on a daily basis. The main problem in the modelling of the aggregation of EVs is the representation of the uncertainties including: (i) type of residential load, (ii) EV location, (iii) rating of EV charger, (iv) EV charging occurrence and (v) EV charging duration.

An EV aggregator proposed in this research will act as a key mediator between the consumers on one side and the markets and the other power system participants on the other side. The EV aggregator may have to forecast: (i) the electricity consumption of its own customers, for forecasting the aggregator's power balance and (ii) the consumption in the electricity system, for forecasting electricity prices. The impact of EVs is significant for the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) as there is a need to manage congestion and voltage drops. As the predicted large deployment of EVs could have an important impact on the grid it is expected to adapt the vehicle as much as possible with the existing infrastructure and this can be achieved by the integration of smart grid control techniques. The primary goal of a Smart Grid is the optimal control of the electricity distribution and the charging of EVs can be controlled to reduce peak load.

In order to answer these questions, this project draws on methodologies and results across the boundaries of engineering and informatics. This is an exciting opportunity to bring qualitative and quantitative research methods together to study a complex system covering load forecasting and smart management of EVs. This project aims to (i) investigate control algorithms for smart management of EVs considering the spatial diversity of EVs throughout the network and temporal diversity of EV charging patterns and (ii) demonstrate a practical way of implementing control algorithms to facilitate the future deployment of EVs by laboratory validation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will investigate control algorithms to facilitate the future deployment of EVs. The research will:
- Produce open source algorithms for the smart management of electric vehicles that could provide the basis for other researchers to verify and build on this work.
- Provide a classification of the historical data set obtained from Plugged in Places projects if these will be available.
- Provide a smart management control algorithms for the charging of electric vehicles.
- Validate the algorithms against real time simulation and laboratory tests.

The main beneficiaries of this research will be the distribution network operators as the day-ahead short-term load forecasting accuracy affects the economic operation and reliability of the system. Furthermore the electric vehicles aggregation control algorithms will assist distribution system operators to avoid system reinforcement. 

Additional beneficiaries include government and policy representatives (e.g. WAG, and the European Commission), third sector organisations (e.g. Future Transport Systems, Energy Saving Trust, Carbon Trust), representatives of the energy industry (UPL Utility Infrastructure &amp;amp; Energy Management, Mott MacDonald) and academics across a number of disciplines.

The international collaboration with TECNALIA technology centre in Basque country will provide a basis for future collaboration on research projects. 

In addition the applicant will also collaborate with the Cardiff School of Engineering's newly established Knowledge Transfer Centre. This Centre, funded by the Welsh Assembly Government, is designed to facilitate the transfer of technology developed within the School to the commercial sector, and is recruiting experienced Technology Translators to assist in this work. The project will be able to draw on their expertise in knowledge transfer activities in order to achieve maximum impact and help the UK remain at the forefront of engineering technology. 

Publications are a vital part of the dissemination strategy. Successful research results will be published in high-impact factor journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93402</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cenex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial collaboration with Cenex</gtr:description><gtr:id>B16E60BC-A871-4553-AAF9-FE491FA16537</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d8f5a4b9d8f5b8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The analysis of Electric Vehicles charging events using data mining techniques.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Schneider Electric Ltd UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Schneider Electric</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A2F1C44-74C8-49BE-A477-C9A7B3E99656</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of short term load forecasting algorithm for electric vehicles charging</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b965e618b965e62c-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Schneider Electric Ltd UK provided a large sample of electric vehicles charging events that were used for validating the short-term load forecasting algorithm.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have a Non-Disclosure Agreement with Schneider Electric for using a large sample of electric vehicles charging events for training the Short Term Load Forecasting Algorithm developed in Task 1.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Smart Management of Electric Vehicles</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0886B04-9437-4C78-9FC6-4C5038803CC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited as a speaker at the &amp;quot;Autonomic Road Transport Systems (ARTS) Summer School, Paris-Marne La Val&amp;eacute;e.

A short-term EV load forecasting model was developed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), an artificial intelligence technique. Charging events for one year were created using national statistical data, to cover the lack of real historical data of EV's charging events. The SVM model was trained and provided a forecast for the day-ahead EV demand. This forecast was compared with the actual demand of that day, as well as with the forecast output of the Monte Carlo technique. The results prove the effectiveness and accuracy of the SVM proposed model, over a more statistical approach.
A decentralized control framework was developed for a mixture of responsive and unresponsive EVs. The control algorithm was enhanced by an EV load forecasting module to increase its effectiveness. The main aim of the control algorithm was to achieve a valley-filling effect on the demand curve. 
The effectiveness of the control algorithm was tested in a UK generic distribution network considering a geographical area with 3072 customers. Two case studies were investigated. The first case study considered an EV fleet charging at 11kW charging stations comprising of responsive and unresponsive EVs. It was demonstrated that when the EV load forecast option is activated the EVs are adapting their charging schedule to reduce the impact of the unresponsive EVs on the demand curve. The second case study investigated the effect of the charging station's power rate on the effectiveness of the decentralized control model. It was shown that when the forecasting module is activated there is a demand peak reduction for every combination of responsive/unresponsive EVs considering charging rates of 3kW, 11kW and 22kW. 

A multi-agent algorithm (MAS) was developed for the management of EV charging. The MAS consisted of an EVs/DG aggregator agent and &amp;quot;Responsive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Unresponsive&amp;quot; EVs agents. The EVs/DG aggregator agent was responsible to design the appropriate virtual pricing policy so that it can maximize its profit. &amp;quot;Responsive&amp;quot; EVs agents were able to respond rationally to the virtual pricing signals, whereas &amp;quot;Unresponsive&amp;quot; EVs agents were defining their charging schedule regardless the virtual cost. Three cases studies were experimentally validated at the Electric Energy Systems Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens. The first case study investigated the impact of EVs charging on the UK distribution network when the EVs/DG Aggregator was located in the MV/LV transformer. It was demonstrated that the location of the EVs/DG aggregator agent affects the demand and voltage profiles of the LV feeders. The second case study demonstrated the value of the EVs load forecasting in the control strategy. When the EVs/DG aggregator has load forecasting capabilities, the responsive EVs agents are adapting their charging schedule to reduce the impact of the unresponsive EVs agents on the demand curve. The third case study tested the capability of responsive EVs agents to charge preferentially from renewable energy sources. The results demonstrated their capability to reschedule their charging demand according to a real time PV generation profile.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The control algorithms developed in this project can be used by the charging stations providers to enhance their control platform.
The short-term load forecasting algorithm can be used by the DNOs to predict the electric vehicles charging demand.
It was demonstrated that the smart management of EVs charging based on aggregation enhanced by EV load forecasting could be seen as a win-win strategy for both the distribution network operation (DNO) and the vehicle owners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>095DC347-1E99-4024-8311-1608AC1FF80B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df1268d7b228.96541892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Deployment
