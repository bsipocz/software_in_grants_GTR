There are currently no effective treatments. The average life expectancy is three years following diagnosis and 5000 people die/year in the UK of IPF.

Normally in response to injury, lung fibroblasts differentiate into highly synthetic myofibroblasts and produce collagen which results in a scar. These cells then undergo cell death and the collagen is resorbed so that normal tissue architecture is restored. In IPF, there is an abnormal wound healing response and these cells persist and proliferate, continuing to produce collagen which disrupts the normal lung architecture. Recent evidence suggests overactive PI3K signalling is important in driving this process. PI3K is a family of cellular enzymes which promote cell proliferation and cell survival. Class 1 PI3K consists of 4 different enzymes called isoforms. Recently it has been shown that inhibiting PI3K enzymes in lung fibroblasts, reduces TGF-beta (a profibrotic cytokine) induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. However, the details of the molecular pathways involved are poorly understood.

Using lung biopsies of IPF patients from the Royal Brompton Hospital, I will confirm PI3K activation in fibroblasts from scarred areas. I will compare how PI3K is activated by TGF-beta in normal and IPF human lung fibroblasts. I will then determine the importance of different PI3K isoforms in mediating myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. Using an established animal model of lung injury and fibrosis, I will investigate whether drugs which inhibit specific PI3K isoforms lead to a reduction in collagen deposition and fibrosis. Determining the key PI3K isoform involved in fibrosis is important for patients, since very specific drugs are likely to have fewer side-effects than drugs which inhibit all of the PI3K enzymes.

This research will potentially identify new drug targets for controlling excessive collagen deposition and scarring in IPF. This has the potential to benefit these patients whose disease was previously thought to be progressive and irreversible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic parenchymal lung disease, with a median survival of around 3 years. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of IPF are not fully understood. There is emerging evidence that control of phosphatidylinosital-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling is dysregulated in IPF fibroblasts, promoting myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production.

I will examine the hypothesis that dysregulated TGF-beta and extracellular matrix driven PI3K signalling play a key role in the development of IPF by influencing myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition. To address this hypothesis, I aim to
1) Define PI3K isoform and pAkt immunolocalisation in normal and IPF human lung using the extensive collection of IPF lung biopsies at the Royal Brompton.
2) Define the downstream pathway by which TGF-beta leads to PI3K isoform and Akt activation in primary IPF and control human lung fibroblasts in vitro.
3) Determine the role of PI3K in mediating TGF-beta and increased matrix stiffness-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production in primary IPF and control human lung fibroblasts in vitro.
4) Examine the role of PI3K isoform-specific inhibitors in the bleomycin model of lung injury and fibrosis.

Endpoints will be assessed as histological and immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections, ELISA and western blot analysis of phosphoproteins, flow cytometry of fibroblasts, gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels and HPLC for hydroxyproline assessment as an index of collagen deposition. I will also use a novel micro CT approach, developed at UCL in collaboration with GSK, to quantitate fibrosis in the bleomycin model. These studies will shed important light on the mechanisms by which dysregulated PI3K signalling contributes to the development of IPF and potentially lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will provide evidence of dysregulated PI3K signalling in IPF and mechanistic detail of the PI3K/Akt signalling axis in myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. I aim to do this through investigations in vitro followed by confirmatory inhibition strategies using the animal model of lung injury and fibrosis.These findings could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for IPF. 

The primary potential non-academic beneficiaries of the outcomes of the proposed research are patients suffering from IPF. The aim of developing effective novel therapeutic approaches is to improve the prognosis of this devastating disease. IPF has always been considered an irreversible progressive disease, but the disease process could be halted if the dysregulated myofibroblast proliferation and excess collagen deposition can be prevented.

Other beneficiaries include health care system providers. IPF is a chronic and progressive condition which represents an important public healthcare problem in the UK. Patients with IPF experience increased comorbidity and healthcare resource utilisation compared to controls. Exacerbations in disease can result in lengthy hospital admissions. The development of novel therapeutic targets may have an impact on these parameters and lead to healthcare savings.

If the outcomes of this research demonstrate that this pathway is an effective target in the treatment of IPF this may lead to further R&amp;amp;D of a suitable antagonist to treat this condition. This could lead to further financial investment from the UK pharmaceutical industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229528</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IPF Patient and Public Involvement day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7F42239-57B0-4CE3-B083-DCB1304532E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 patients and relatives attended an IPF awareness day at the Royal Brompton. I was asked to talk about current research in IPF and about my research project. This resulted in questions and a discussion about why previous therapies have failed and what promising new agents were in clinical trials.

Patients reportedly enjoyed the day, especially the sections on research. They were informed about current trials ongoing at the Brompton which they may be eligible for.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>Z4BLybVqcj7</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D2C4DFC-6D56-45C6-989B-F4A7938EDBE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Drug design, development and therapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4aed850b56a49305623949eb9b1eef2f"><gtr:id>4aed850b56a49305623949eb9b1eef2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodcock HV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1177-8881</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_23635_25_23818761</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC5F8534-4C90-4E81-AD2C-EE5228C19FE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Review of the British Thoracic Society Winter Meeting 2016, 7-9 December, London, UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Thorax</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4aed850b56a49305623949eb9b1eef2f"><gtr:id>4aed850b56a49305623949eb9b1eef2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woodcock HV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-6376</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa7feb0eaa2a2.32726318</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>839C58AD-E15C-4A40-8912-A5A9C290DF4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A structurally distinct TGF-?
