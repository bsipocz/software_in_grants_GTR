This will be achieved by creating a Network of scientists, industrialists, social scientists, life cycle analysts and stakeholders from feedstock supply to production industries in order to define bottlenecks and barriers to biorefining from technical, logistical and socio-economic perspectives. Through an initial scoping meeting, members of the Network will identify the key obstacles and areas where improvement is required, and the cross-disciplinary strategies needed to address this, in order to progress the field. Through the targeted funding of small &amp;quot;Proof of Concept&amp;quot; studies, information will be generated which will enable Network members to develop targeted robust proposals to bid into larger funding programmes with preliminary data and an established inter-disciplinary base to work from. 
In addition to Proof of Concept studies, the Network will operate as a central source of information (e.g. via the website), a voice for sustainable production of chemicals from plants and a promoter of Network activities. The website will provide, information about network research activities, a directory of members and their areas of research expertise and relevant funding opportunities and conferences. The Network will support training of PhD students and PDRAs to promote the development of a skill base in the IB area. Through Network showcases and defined Impact activities, we will promote the objectives and achievements of the Network, actively champion the benefits of sustainable production of chemicals and materials from plants and become the first port of call for advice to companies, policy-makers and the international scientific community. In the latter respect, we will be actively seeking to create links and engage members in UK, EU and wider international programmes. Indeed, the success of the Network may ultimately be judged by these outcomes.
Ultimately this network will have a role in delivering a sustainable UK bio-economy through integrated biorefining pipelines, maximising product streams from feedstocks and increasing production efficiency, there by stimulating economic growth and job creation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to run a Network focusing on the conversion of plant material, including agricultural by-products and agro-industrial co-products to chemicals and materials. The aim is to overcome barriers to biorefining of feedstocks by optimisation of multi-stream processes through integration of disciplines and exploitation of emerging technologies. In order to do this we have assembled a scientific management group which has expertise across the biorefinery process chain, including industrialists, and a strategy management group comprised of industrialists and other stakeholders (suppliers and end-users), together with an multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, modellers, social scientists, environmental and life cycle analysts, which comprises the initial Network.
We believe that the route to tackling current technical and commercial bottlenecks in developing a sustainable process for producing chemicals from biomass based renewables lies in effective communication between disciplines. Therefore, the initial activities of the network will focus on a desk-based scoping study and meeting to establish the capabilities and perceptions of the Network and the focal points that we need to address. This will be followed up with a call for funding of Proof of Concept projects to address the key issues, ideally in an inter-disciplinary manner. These projects will be highly targeted and funded in 3 waves, allowing the second wave to address issues under-represented in the first wave of awards and, if necessary, the final tranche to be used for commissioning specific projects.
The purpose of this exercise is to provide the necessary information, contacts and skills to be able to be effective in applications for further funding through eg Catalyst, 20/20 Horizon and similar national and international programme. This strategic approach has the potential to make a step change in biorefinery processes, benefitting the UK economy and employment in the IB sector.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Wider Academic Community: The breadth of research areas covered by this Network means our research outputs will be of interest to biochemists, microbiologists, synthesis and systems biologists, synthetic chemists, chemical and process engineers, agronomists, social scientists and economists. To reach these audiences, the PI, CoI, project manager and PDRA involved in Proof of Concept studies will present at a range of forums in addition to subject focused conferences, in order to exemplify the application of specific disciplines (see JoR for specific targets). In addition we will require that the work will be published in high impact subject specific and project focused open-access journals.
Generic outputs from this project, such as advances in modelling, new strains, tools and enzymes for metabolic and process engineering will also benefit the wider academic community.
Commercial Private Sector: This research has the potential to benefit both commercial producer and user communities. Microbial strains, enzyme, chemical and engineering process methodologies developed here could be used to produce chemical intermediates from a range of renewable feedstocks in a manner which is integrated into pre-treatment. The home grown cereals authority (HGCA) and ABAgri represent major connection points between agricultural suppliers and potential end users and we have agreements from both of these organisations to assist with accessing feedstocks. 
The Network has very strong industrial representation on the Strategic Advisory Group, Science Management Group and as members of the Network. This represents activities across the biorefinery process chain, including companies interested in process engineering (eg Dynamic extractions, Johnson Matthey), companies interested in exploiting particular fermentation/enzyme technologies (Green Biologics, Celbius) and end user companies interested in particular product applications (P&amp;amp;G, Riverdia, Sasol, Chemoxy). During the project, links to this community will be enhanced through the activities of SAG and engagement with the Industrial Biotechnology Leadership Forum.
National and International Perspective:
Climate change: A primary driver for the move to producing chemicals from sustainably derived renewables, in preference to fossil fuels, is the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the complete lifecycle of a chemical product, an efficiently operated biorefinery using cellulosic substrates should be able to deliver an 80% reduction in GHG emissions compared to its fossil fuel equivalent, supporting national targets. 
Green jobs: The UK chemical sector employs thousands of people and generates a trade surplus of around &amp;pound;6.5 billion/annum. However, it faces an enormous challenge to reduce its reliance on petrochemical feedstocks, reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and improve sustainability. The successful delivery of this project will have an impact on delivering green jobs in both producer and user industries within the UK. For the PDRAs, the possibility of interacting with and potentially spending time working with industrialists in the field will give them an excellent perspective of both academic and industrial research environments, that should be invaluable for their future employment prospects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>639818</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop in Brazil (Unicamp)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>305A5F52-0676-4076-9721-5A6BAFE50EA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Use the opportunity to present the philosophy of NiBBs, with a focus on P2P to Brazilian delegates at a workshop hosted by Unicamp (Campinas)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c96b983b8e68.91584799</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>THE BBSRC GCRF WORKSHOP GRANT</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8351D68D-5BA1-4407-9F53-AD1B371609A5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c95eefc824d7.91361451</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>922368</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Joint FAPESP-BBSRC Call for Collaborative Proposals in Integrated Biorefinery Approaches for the Manufacture of Advanced Biofuels</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/P017460/1	</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>2BED10DF-C5C9-443E-BA91-C364060C276D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c95c5e263683.32460917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. Achievements and highlights of 2014
1.1. Project kick-off
Immediately after the formal start of P2P we held a one day meeting (13/2/14) of the SMB (+ Dr Steve Martin) in Aston, where David Leak introduced the structure of, and Research Council vision for the NIBB, together with details of funding availability. The bulk of the meeting then focused on agreements on governance, management and operation of the NIBB, including dealing with issues of confidentiality and conflicts of interest. The SMB were also updated on progress in appointing the Network Manager, plans for a desktop &amp;quot;gap analysis&amp;quot; and plans for the first whole Network Meeting.
1.2. First Network Meeting
We ran our first whole Network event on the 14-15th April 2014 at Bailbrook House Hotel in Bath. We had around 38 people attend, which, given the original membership numbers was 59, seemed to be a reasonable turn-out. We introduced the upcoming funding opportunities and set the scene for our members to come together and discuss/ agree what the main themes of the Network should be, given that we have a particularly broad remit. We also highlighted that we had commissioned a gap analysis report and that the outputs of the discussion at the meeting would form part of the report. Despite the short time we had to organise the event it was a success on several levels:
1) Three main themes for the Networks activities were identified -
a) Process optimisation for exemplar processes/ systems
b) New options on functionality targets - primarily replacing existing products/ materials with novel ones which address the same functionality, but could also be process functionality too
c) New applications within existing processes (eg. milling and malting) for current process outputs
2) We introduced new members to the original core
3) We informed members of the facilities, resources (including feedstocks) and expertise available within the network
4) The outputs of the discussion and talks were captured as part of the gap analysis report, to be used to underpin our activities
5) New relationships formed through informal networking - led to at least one proof of concept proposal in the subsequent funding call. 
1.3. Second Network Meeting: Economic Modelling Tools
One of the main discussion points coming out of the first meeting was the need for some simple economic modelling tools based on some example processes to help people demonstrate the economic viability and commercial impact of their ideas and concepts. The Network tried to find some alternative solutions initially but it became apparent that perhaps funding a specific modelling tool development would be the best/ quickest way of delivering this. To effectively scope out the call and to engage a number of modelling experts/ industry supporters and end-users we organised our second whole Network meeting to focus on developing modelling tools. The meeting was held on the 21st November at the Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Imperial College, London. The event was ostensibly sold out with 50 registered attendees though slightly less than this turned up. There was a good mix of modellers, industry and end-users. We started proceedings with a number of industry perspectives from different backgrounds and then introduced what modelling was all about. The presentations flowed nicely from one to another and the subsequent discussions were well facilitated by Mindset Method.
 The meeting was deemed a big success because:
1. From the discussion we were able to establish a clear scope for the call, which is now open. 
2. As a result of the discussions Kirstin Covington had with some delegates ahead of the event we had a number of new members (six in total) join from the modelling community. 
3. The community of people attending were enthused by the opportunity and we are expecting some good applications to the call
4. There was good networking between the various groups and industry representatives which also bodes well for some strong applications with good industry involvement.
1.4. Joint NIBB/ IBTI Meeting with LBNet and FoodWasteNet
BBSRC requested that P2P, LBNet and FoodWasteNet ran a joint event following on from a BBSRC organised IBTI dissemination event on the 20-21st October in Cardiff. Despite our initial concerns that the time allocated would be too much, we feel we got value out of the event. The Networks jointly agreed that the event should focus on early career scientists, as there would be a significant proportion of this demographic in the IBTI audience. Following an introduction to the networks and what they have been up to, we ran a couple of discussion sessions - the first giving early career scientists a chance to ask more experienced scientist what skills in addition to the technical expertise they would look for in potential candidates. This was followed by a second discussion session where we looked to establish what activities etc the individual Networks (either singly or jointly) could run/ deliver to help the early career scientists particularly (but not exclusively) build up their skills in the areas identified in the first session. The Networks got some good feedback on the types of activities, not just events, which would be appropriate and useful to early career scientists as well as some others that would be useful for all our members. These outputs are now incorporated into the Network plan/ strategy for next year. 
No new members arose from this event as IBTI members are already heavily engaged with a number of Networks. 
1.5. Gap Analysis Report
This report was completed in July 2014 and is a good summary of the both the outputs of the kick-off meeting in April and gauge of the concerns and challenges facing biorefining and industrial biotechnology. It concludes that the challenges, while not insurmountable, are many, complex and interlinked so that when delivering technical solutions the other factors impacting and influencing the commercial sector cannot be ignored. Therefore within the wider vision to deliver a sustainable UK bioeconomy, the Network should focus on product manufacture and interface with other Networks that focus on feedstock availability and processing. We will establish a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue and promote close interaction between academic and commercial sectors to drive development of integrated programmes that will identify and address critical bottlenecks that at present restrict the development of an integrated bioeconomy. Through focus on a number of example processes that require different scales of operation, the Network will both deliver commercially-relevant solutions and enhance the skillset of the workforce in the academic and industrial sectors. One immediate example was the need for some (techno)economic modelling tools to help people demonstrate the economic viability and commercial impact of their ideas and concepts.
1.6. Opening Funding Calls
1.6.1. Proof of Concept Funds
The network opened the first P2P Proof of Concept call in June 2014. It was an open call based on the three main themes for the Network:
1. Process optimisation for exemplar processes/ systems
2. New options on functionality targets
3. New applications within existing processes for current process outputs
The call closed on the 11th July with ten applications submitted, five of which were funded and we felt that this was a good result for our first call. As a result of our first call and assessment process we revised our scoring and assessment of applications to be more in line with the TSB scoring and less like the BBSRC scoring as it seemed more appropriate for the types of projects we are expecting to fund.
The second PoC call is due to open mid-December, following the meeting on the 21st November which helped us establish the scope. 
1.6.2. Business Interaction Vouchers
This call opened, after some delay, in October 2014, with the aim that it will remain open for the duration of the Network. To date we have yet to receive any applications, though we are aware that a number of groups are interested in applying. There is therefore little more to report. 
1.7. Community Engagement
Members of the executive committee have attended a number of events representing the P2P Network during 2014:
Event Date Audience Outcomes
Consumer Products through Industrial Biotechnology Across the Value Chain; IBLF 5th June Industrial, Government &amp;amp; Academic interested in IB ? At least one new member of P2P
? Met other NIBB network managers
? Circulated information sheet to a number of attendees

IBBE Grantholders workshop; EFB 27-28th November Industrial, Government &amp;amp; Academic interested in IB The network was briefly introduced and examples were given to inform the IB community of the scientific space in which this network wishes to operate. Update on current activities was also presented
 
In addition, P2P's twitter account has 135 followers, from a broad range of sectors. Twitter has primarily been used to share Network news on meetings and funding calls as well as sharing relevant news flow from RCUK and InnovateUK in addition to news from the biorefining, renewables, biochemical, bioenergy, industrial biotechnology, synthetic biology and engineering sectors. As such we have shared over 1,600 tweets to date. To better understand our social media impact via Twitter going forward we will be monitoring retweets, mentions and new followers each week.
Our LinkedIn group has had less impact thus far. We currently have 37 members - most are P2P Network members, but not all. We will need to do more to make this an effective social media tool for our members.
In October we launched our revamped website which seems to have gone down well with our members as we have had a number of comments regarding the ease of navigation. 
Finally, we have the &amp;quot;members only&amp;quot; P2P database. This is a secure web-based site which our members register to access. The database provides our registered members a range of useful tools, e.g. a searchable contacts database of all registered users, facilities/equipment available with Gantt charts for booking, a document repository as well as confidential areas for building projects or storing PoC and other reports. The database was one of the first available across all NIBB networks.
Thus far we believe we have delivered reasonable, varied and targeted engagement with the relevant IB community, but we believe we can do a lot more and this will form a large part of our strategy and plans for next year. 

1. Activities and highlights of 2015
1.1. Awarding second round PoC funds: Technoeconomic modelling project
The SMB and co-opted assessor, Charles Gordon from Britest, met in March to assess the five applications received for this funding call. It was particularly challenging to decide which project to award funds to as they all had their merits, but in the end it was decided that a group led by Tony Bridgwater at Aston University should receive the funds as their proposal seemed to be particularly strong on engaging with the rest of the P2P community and developing the tools based on their requirements. Funds of &amp;pound;50, 781 have been awarded and the project began in July 2015.
1.2. Funding Workshop March 2015
Approximately thirty people attended this meeting in Birmingham on the 17th March 2015. The official focus for the workshop was the Network's third theme - &amp;quot;new applications within existing processes for current process outputs&amp;quot; - and the aim of the meeting was to provide our members with an opportunity to build those initial projects that build relationships between industry and academia, to coincide with our &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; Business Interaction Voucher (BIV) call.
We had some great speakers who set the scene nicely: Graham Ruecroft from Celbius, Philippa Frunival from Croda, Dhivya Puri from Fiberight, Grant Campbell and Joe Gallagher. Between them the speakers laid out the importance of an integrated approach to providing solutions, particularly in an industrial setting, and giving some pointers as to what things are of interest and examples of skills and facilities available to the network. This was followed by a networking session where delegates started sharing what they were interested in working on and what they had to offer. This seemed to go well and we soon had groups of people in deep discussion, formulating a number of collaborative projects. Overall, there was a good buzz of creativity in the room and we received six BIV proposals as a result of this meeting - ie more than half of the applications in the first call. From these discussions, a number of projects were also developed that were subsequently submitted to the IB catalyst call.
1.3. Biobased surfactants meeting 6th July 2015
This was organised as a &amp;quot;satellite&amp;quot; workshop to the University of Bath Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technology Summer Showcase - to make the most of a captive audience and encourage attendees to participate in both events. The focus also fitted well with our second theme - New options on functionality targets. Although shorter than our previous funding workshop held in March, we took a similar approach and brought together experts from industry and academia, working/ interested in the field of bio- and biobased surfactants to again help build links and collaborations. We had four excellent presentations from Sarah Hosking (Unilever), Amanda Shufflebottom (Croda), Peter Williams (Glyndwr) and Pattanathu Rahman (Teesside) who all helped to set the scene nicely for some general discussion before people broke into smaller groups and networked over lunch. 
This meeting was approximately two weeks before the close of our second BIV call and there were potentially two applications submitted as a result of applicants/ partners attending this meeting. We also know of at least one interaction that has resulted in additional PhD studentships being discussed and set-up.
1.4. P2P Showcase meeting November
This was our biggest event this year. Just over 75 attendees registered for this two day event in Manchester on the 10-11th November. We started by showcasing the first five Proof of Concept projects - more information about the outputs of these projects can be found in section 3.
Our sessions around &amp;quot;engineering the process&amp;quot; were kicked off by Jo Kockelkoren from Reverdia, who shared Reverdia's experiences of developing their products and markets and how they have had to consider the whole value chain in order to deliver business success. We then got to hear about the work that IFR are undertaking to unlock the potential of the National Yeast Culture Collection from Ian Roberts. Next, Dana Heldt at CHAIN Biotech introduced their approach to developing Clostridia as a platform organism before Ian Tebble at Rebio extolled the virtues of Geobacillus.
The next session was introduced by Richard van Kranenburg from Corbion who highlighted the challenges of introducing lignocellulosic based processes within existing infrastructure and how considering the process as a whole can allow you to save costs, reduce by-products and simplify the process. This philosophy was echoed by Gustavo Valente Perez at Zuvasyntha who highlighted the importance of engineering led process design in optimising processes. Finally, Gavin Thomas introduced the sorts of solutions that they and others at CBMNet are exploring in terms of delivering process organisms that address some of the challenges of getting things in and out of cells which in turn impacts the success of a fermentative process.
Our speakers set the scene nicely for our discussion around process optimisation and Steve Martin at Zuvasyntha brought together some thoughts and challenges for us to get our teeth into which in turn prompted some interesting ideas and discussions - and importantly, got people talking to each other.
The following day was all about providing companies and academics with the information and tools to help their activities - with one session focussed on IP management and the importance of this to investors - thanks to John and Sarah from Gill, Jennings and Every and Andrew Muir at Midven for running this session. The parallel session discussed opportunities for funding, collaboration building, finding expertise and building those project and business plans - thanks goes to Charlotte Bell, Michael Burnett, Marc Van de Craen, Derek Lincoln and Colin Bird for the information and expertise they shared. Attendees then had the opportunity to book one-to-one sessions with a range of different experts, to continue networking and to start working up project and collaboration ideas which seemed to be a great way of closing out the event. 
It is too early yet to say how much impact this meeting has had on members' collaborations etc but I am aware of a number of PoC applications that are being formulated by attendees of this meeting and we had a lot of very positive feedback on how useful people found this event. Introducing some key players in Europe seemed to go down particularly well and supports our move to support members' EU funding activities.
1.5. New facilities database within P2P database
One of our objectives for this year was to set-up a series of databases or information packages, including a facilities database. There are a number of equipment and other databases as well as a report into the scale-up facilities available to groups in the UK, however feedback to Kirstin suggested that people often found these unsatisfactory - either they couldn't search effectively for facilities because they were not familiar with what pieces of equipment specifically they needed; or they needed expert help as well as the equipment and this information was often unavailable; or the details on how facilities could be accessed - eg conditions of &amp;quot;hire&amp;quot;, information on costs, availability and contact details - where not always available. With this in mind, and in conjunction with other discussions and suggestions made to us, we decided in the first instance to set-up the P2P facilities database within the P2P members database using a series of broad headings such as &amp;quot;Biomass Production&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Biomass Processing and Extraction&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Chemical Transformation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Biological Transformation&amp;quot; etc. to help people navigate to the facilities they need and the details about those facilities. 
This &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; database has now been set-up and &amp;quot;populated&amp;quot; by some key facilities, and corresponding expertise, available within the P2P network - Aberystwyth, BDC, IFR, Croda etc - with a view that more will be added. The database was launched at the P2P Showcase event in November 2015 as it was felt that this could be a useful tool for people as they look to build their projects and collaborations.
1.6. Opening Funding Calls
1.6.1. Proof of Concept Funds: Process Optimisation
Our third Proof of Concept call was launched at the beginning of December and will close on the 5th February. Contact with members suggest that there is significant interest in this call. 
1.6.2. Business Interaction Vouchers
With no uptake in our open call, it was decided that we should have a rolling programme of BIV calls with set closing dates. Thus far we have not had specific focus calls for these BIV and have run two calls this year. The first closed on the 31st March 2015 and we had 11 applications in total, from which we selected 10 projects to award. The second call closed 30th July 2015 and this time we had five applications, from which we selected two. 
1.6.3. Summer Studentship Bursary
The decision to run this call came quite late so in order to give members sufficient time to capture students or write their bids we ran two back to back calls in May and June. We received seven applications in the first call and four in the second. We awarded three projects in the first and three in the second call. 

1.7. Community Engagement
Members of the executive committee have attended a number of events representing the P2P Network during 2015:

In addition, followers to P2P's twitter account has risen this year from 135 to 307 followers, from a broad range of sectors. We continue to share Network news on meetings and funding calls as well as sharing other news which is likely to be relevant to our IB community. As such we have shared over 4,300 tweets to date. 
We are using MailChimp to circulate our monthly newsletter and this seems to be quite successful. Despite the increase in members over the year, we have managed to maintain a fairly consistent open rate of 28-30% (the average open rate for our category is 18%), and while we have a core set of members that consistently open the newsletter each month, there are others that are not part of this core set that seem to open newsletters which are more relevant to their needs/ interests. We can also monitor what links get followed and unsurprisingly most of these are for events and specific funding calls (as opposed to the more general IPA, LOLA, Innovation Voucher and SMART awards). Our click rate is a bit more varied than our open rate - ranging from 5-11% (category average 2.1%) - but this is probably down to the range of events and funding calls available each month. It seems that people use the newsletter effectively as a database resource for funding calls and events as we see multiple opens (sometimes 20+) from individuals and multiple clicks on links that are of particular interest. We therefore decided to use the newsletter rather than the members database as the repository for event and funding information - to deliver to the objective of providing such information to our members.
1. Activities and highlights of 2016
1.1. Awarding third round PoC funds: Process OPtimisation
The SMB met in March to assess the six applications received for this funding call. There were five good applications covering a broad range of topics which were awarded funds totalling &amp;pound;206,785. Most of these project kicked-off by the end of May and are coming close to completion.
1.2. IB Skills Workshop May 2016
This was an Early Career Researcher training event, organised by Cogent Skills and IBLF and supported by nine of the NIBB, including Plants to Products. It was a skills workshop designed to introduce ECR to day to day life/ expectations in a range of research organisations - commercial and academic - as well as providing delegates with an opportunity to have one-to-one sessions with industry representatives and hone their grant writing skills. From the feedback we and the IBLF received it was a great success and valued by those who attended so we would be supportive of getting involved in similar future opportunities.
1.3. Joint IBTI-NIBB event June/July 2016
This was organised as a final dissemination event for the IBTI club (Integrated Biorefining Research and Technology Club) joined with a Network event - involving P2P, ADNet, FoodWasteNet and LBNet. The focus was the &amp;quot;waste value chain&amp;quot; with three sessions covering the value chain from different perspectives - the feedstock end, the product end and the policy/ regulation that influences the waste value chain. There was a good attendance and the feedback we got was that delegates found the event and the networking useful. There was a significant amount of interest in the BAM technoeconimic modelling tools that the Aston team develop in their P2P funded PoC project which was presented by Katie Chong.
1.4. P2P Showcase at EFIB 2016
This was our biggest event this year and our main European engagement drive this year. Although not as big a success as we had hoped there were some positives to take away and for those who attended the event it did seem genuinely useful. We think the impact of the event had perhaps been hampered by the Brexit vote - meaning other groups attending the EFIB event where focussed on dealing with new government departments and a unified &amp;quot;UK IB is open for business&amp;quot; voice was not present, unlike some of our European counterparts. Numbers were down on last year's event, though we did get some EFIB delegates also signing up to attend. Our main learning I think from trying this is that - a) our members are more likely to attend if there is not registration fee and overnight accommodation is included if it is necessary; b) having an event associated with another, bigger event, is probably a good idea, but it should not be held in parallel to part of the main event, rather it should be at a time either before or after; c) the organisations involved in supporting industrial biotechnology in the UK need to have a more united presence - this is slowly changing with the set-up of BioPilot UK Alliance, but this was a distinct effort, separate from the presence of IBLF and BBSRC (and the few NIBB that were there).
We did have some very good presenters and really nice pieces of work being described by them. Lucy Nattrass from AkzoNobel was our keynote speaker, followed by David Randall, Tim Davies and Jonathan Hughes. We had a series of elevator pitch presentations and then we asked Katie Chong (talking about the BAM modelling tools), Adam Charlton (representing the BioPilot UK Alliance) and Davide Di Maio from NNFCC (talking about the BioBase4SME Project) just to give a quick overview on their tools and services.
1.5. Update on facilities database within P2P database
Despite the ongoing requests for people to be able to access a facilities database that would allow them to identify scale-up facilities and expertise within the UK, the prototype we set-up in the P2P database has not been well utilised. However, with the launch of BioPilot UK Alliance, this database has an opportunity to have more of an impact here and this will be pursued next year.
1.6. Opening Funding Calls
1.6.1. Business Interaction Vouchers
We opened two BIV calls this year - one which closed in May, where we made three awards - and one which closed in December for which we have had four applications. BIV awards are now made up to &amp;pound;10,000 and we tend to have a steady but small take-up, meaning pretty much each application in each round gets awarded. If we make all four awards from the round 4 BIV call in December, we will have a little over &amp;pound;57,000 BIV funding remaining to award - which I believe matches the trajectory of spend we intended, namely give out the majority of the funds in the first three years and keep a small amount for the last two. 
1.6.2. Summer Studentship Bursary
The 2015 summer studentship bursary scheme was popular so we decided to running again, but this time using BIV funds - so splitting 1 x &amp;pound;10,000 BIV into 5 x &amp;pound;2,000 awards. We ran the call a little earlier this year, closing it in April 2016. We received four applications, all of which were funded and covered a broad spectrum of projects. 

1.7. Community Engagement
Followers to P2P's twitter account has risen this year from 307 to 433 followers, still from a broad range of sectors. We continue to share Network news on meetings and funding calls as well as sharing other news which is likely to be relevant to our IB community. As such we have shared over 5,500 tweets to date.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CC9A602-7FA2-43DA-88A0-77209C05D69F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c45940af0409.93515140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The P2P Network has funded a number of Proof of Concept awards and Business Interaction Vouchers that have enabled industry and academia to work together to test concepts/ideas that address industrial need and have potential to provide novel solutions.

The objective was to provide a web-based, user driven, flexible and robust biorefinery modelling system for the NIBB network. The system will support non-expert users to assess future R&amp;amp;D, facilitate process design and compare the viability of multiple biorefinery configurations. For example, the model may be used to assess the optimum pre-treatment method for the production of butanol from wheat straw.
The proof of concept (PoC) model focuses on the production of butanol, succinic acid and purified sugars from three different feedstocks (wheat straw, sugar beet and forestry residues) by means of two different pre-treatment methods (steam explosion and acid hydrolysis). Each process step is modelled as a separate 'module' connected to a process chain using inbuilt logic rules. Each module fully describes the process in terms of inputs, outputs and cost.
The structure gives the flexibility to introduce new data, processes or modules in the future. An original web-based user interface will support accessibility, allowing selection of multiple biorefinery configurations or process modules from the options. The system's key process and economic data outputs for user's chosen biorefinery configuration will be shaped and validated by industrial partners: ReBio, Croda and BioSyntha. The web-based user interface will be released for beta-testing to the industrial partners during the project and to the wider network at the project end.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CF3ACBE-7D30-4D09-B54A-954585B63692</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Aston team have had a lot of interest, particularly industry - mainly SMEs - who would like to further develop the tools to cover their feedstock of interest/ process</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9608d776da9.01125128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>BAM Technoeconomic modelling tools</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L013819/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
