Drawing on my experience to date as a dramatist who writes with a commitment to and engagement with vulnerable groups (in schools, prisons, women's hostels), what I propose is a programme of sustained research that will assist me in understanding what I need to think about when working in these community situations. This means that I need to understand what makes for a 'safe' environment working with vulnerable groups. How, for example, as a theatre practitioner, am I able to use drama games, exercises, or writing techniques to encourage a better sense of self-esteem and creativity in those not used to a 'making' environment? Working in this way, I would aim to establish a set of 'good practice' guidelines for working with vulnerable groups in community settings. \n\nMore specifically, however, as I recognise that a project cannot simply focus on just any vulnerable groups, I want to undertake this research with a focus on women recovering from violence. I have a long-standing interest in playwriting that focuses on oppressed communities of women - young women especially - and would want to bring that interest, passion even, into my project. Hence I propose to work with three kinds of communities of women recovering from violence: women coming to terms with domestic abuse; women whose lives have been affected by the penal system and women recovering from being trafficked in prostitution. Violence is the common factor in all three of these groups, but at the same time, as much as I am aware of the possible similarities between the groups, I shall also need to focus on difference: different experiences, different needs and different routes to the recovery of self-esteem and the discovery of creativity. \n\nWhile I have had extensive experience of workshopping in theatre and community contexts (see CV) / I have not, thus far, been able to approach this from a research basis. My case of support document outlines a planned programme of research that is designed for me to arrive at a more complete understanding of what applied theatre techniques and strategies work best, are most appropriate, to the groups that I am working with, and to assess the relevance and applicability of this to other vulnerable, oppressed communities. All of this work would then be of relevance to practitioners from health, social, and theatre communities, and, of course, to the women's communities themselves.\n\nAs a writer who believes in theatre as a public forum for social and political debate, I consider it important in our contemporary moment, when a number of theatre practitioners, writers and companies are showing an interest in dramatic representations of vulnerable groups, to research and to reflect on the most appropriate means of giving 'voices' to others. Hence, in tandem with my consideration of workshop practice, I shall research current dramaturgical practices and theories in order to understand what the most appropriate and effective dramatic means might be for 'creating alternative realities' for women recovering from violence. All of this research will feed into the writing of a new play. As a writer, as a dramatist, theatre will serve as a public platform for my proposed programme of AHRC funded research.\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198371</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E005160/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2DB2E75A-C815-466B-A26B-60EB301AD722</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dramaturgy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
