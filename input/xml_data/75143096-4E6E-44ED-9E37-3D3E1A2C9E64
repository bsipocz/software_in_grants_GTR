One way to address this challenge is to construct subsurface geological repositories in which this waste can be stored over long-term (&amp;gt;millennia) timescales. In this network proposal (GeoRepNet), we intend to develop a three-year collaborative network to investigate and prioritise the major challenges involved in the design, construction and maintenance of geological repositories. 

The network is comprised six workpackages that will address the geophysical, geochemical and biological challenges of establishing and operating geological repositories and investigate methods of monitoring geological repositories. The technical focus of the network, addressed by a dedicated workpackage, will examine the cross-transfer of technology from the space and astronomical communities into geological repository monitoring, for example miniaturised in-situ instruments designed for planetary exploration and spectroscopic methods of monitoring repository atmospheres to detect leakage of wastes. 

The network will implement its objectives using three major meetings (one in each of the network years) and a series of satellite workshops. Important in the network's objectives will be developing the next generation of scientists involved in the establishment of geological repositories and one meeting will be dedicated to this objective. The network will make use of a web site and social networking technologies to implement its objectives. The network is primarily a UK network, but it will draw in international collaboration to achieve its objectives and maximise the expertise available for the achievement of its objectives.

Our overall aim is to create a step change in the identification, prioritisation and provision of solutions, to establishing and maintaining geological repositories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? 
GeoRepNet will benefit non-academic organisations. Organisations involved in developing geological repositories will benefit from the output of all six work packages. These organisations include the National Nuclear Laboratory and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Our network includes members of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, who are involved in carbon capture and storage. 
 The network will have direct relevance to industrial partners involved in STFC technology development, in planetary sciences and astronomy. The network includes individuals involved in the miniature Raman spectrometer and Life Marker Chip instruments for ExoMars and astronomical spectroscopy. The requirement for ruggedness, radiation resistance and tolerance of extreme environmental conditions in instruments used in planetary missions makes the expertise within the industrial and academic arena in building instruments for planetary exploration directly relevant to planetary exploration. 

How might they benefit from this?
The network work packages are focused on identifying and prioritising the key scientific and technical questions with establishing and maintaining geological repositories. The first three of our work packages look at geophysical, geochemical and geobiological questions and attempt to understand what the major unanswered questions are about how these processes influence repositories. Two of our work packages (WP5 and 6) are cross-cutting technology themes with a focus on identifying technologies required for repository monitoring and the translation of technology from planetary sciences and astronomy (STFC-funded technology) into geological repositories. 
The work from these work packages will be of direct interest to organisations seeking to understand: 1) the best places to establish repositories, and 2) the most likely challenges to emerge during their establishment. Organisations to whom this will be relevant include the NDA, the National Nuclear Laboratory, CSIRO, which are involved in establishing repositories. By taking part in the meetings we organise and joining our network (these organisations already have representatives on our network), these partner organisations will benefit from the network activity.
During the course of the network the information produced by the network will be made available on the website or made available through traditional means such as peer-reviewed position papers available for non-academic industrial and government partners.

What will be done to ensure that the potential beneficiaries have the opportunity to engage with this network?

GeoRepNet has an open structure. Non-academic partners, who will have the opportunity to engage in two ways: 
1) by taking part in the meetings and satellite workshops that we have planned during the network, and 
2) placing information, profiles and other content on the network web site.
 Many industries will automatically become involved in the network. Work packages 5 and 6 are cross-cutting technology themes that focus on identifying technologies to be used in monitoring geological repository sites (WP5) and specifically, identifying technologies in STFC-funded planetary science and astronomy arenas (WP6) that could be translated into use in geological repositories. The individuals involved in this network who will lead these work packages have links to industry in developing existing instrumentation (e.g. Miniature Raman, Life Marker Chip, astronomical spectroscopy). During the three core meetings (and satellite workshops dedicated to technology transfer), WP5 and 6 will be tasked with identifying technology that can be transferred into the monitoring of geological repository sites and identifying industry partners. A key output of this network is that paths for technology development from the planetary science/astronomy arenas into the geological repository arena are identified.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243775</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant has been used to advance the links between geological repositories and work related to STFC including high technology transfer from astronomy and particle physics.

We have also given out travel awards and grants to individuals and teams, details of which can be found at www.georepnet.org. These monies have been used by these individuals to, for example, develop new instrumentation for application in geological repositories (e.g. XRD at the University of Leicester) and other applications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>27C3BF6D-068F-4BC1-9C75-7F18F1FED964</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>57324d66d04068.11506690</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This network has developed new priorities and ideas for the transfer of technology into geological repositories.
