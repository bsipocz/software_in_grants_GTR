Due to their exceptional mechanical efficiency, they are ubiquitous in nature and industry, yet they are less well understood than almost any other class of materials. Among the best known mechanical qualities of these structures are their high strength-to-weight ratio and their energy absorption capacity, which are due the inextricable relation between the geometric architecture and the constitutive properties of the underlying solid mater. The aim of this project is to gain insight into the properties of cellular structures of nonlinear elastic material and their overall response under loads by providing both a new framework to understand the mechanical properties of these structures and rigorous mathematical techniques for the analysis of their large elastic deformations caused by the application of external loads. Taking into account the interplay between the geometry and the mechanical qualities of the elastic cell walls, novel numerical methods will be devised to compute effective lower and upper bounds for the critical load causing densification by cell closure in various cellular structures, and the bounds gap will be used as an indicator for the computational error. In this context, the proposed investigation and non-standard numerical procedures are novel and have many potential applications. For example, the development of new flexible stents and scaffolds for soft tissue re-growth in biomedical applications is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary area of biomaterials and tissue engineering, and many foams and sponges designed for cushioning and re-usability can also be found in everyday life as well as in several industrial areas, e.g. microelectronics, aerospace, pharmaceutical and food processes. For these complex materials to be understood and optimised with respect to their mechanical response, reliable computer models supported by rigorous mathematical mechanical analysis are needed, and may also open the way for new applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries identified in this case for support, the potential impact of the proposed research may be broken down into the following areas.

KNOWLEDGE AND PEOPLE. The limit analysis of elastic cellular structures is an important issue which has received little attention from the mathematical community to date. The long-term ambition is to make the new results useful for modern practical applications in bio-medical and material engineering, and also to help to identify new applications. From an applied mathematics point of view, the immediate goal is to inform the engineering research community who would then be able to test the mathematical results on a wide range of man-made materials of engineering interest. 

LAM is an effective and welcome communicator within both the mathematical and engineering communities, as demonstrated by her track record, and her presentations at conferences and research seminars during the project will enhance the visibility of cellular materials and also encourage young researchers from both these communities into the area. 

As a direct outcome, the project will train a young postdoctoral researcher in the solid mechanics underlying the physical model of cellular materials and the mathematical and numerical techniques needed to understand and analyse these materials. 

In order to validate the computational results on real physical structures, Prof Sam Evans (Cardiff, Engineering) has agreed to carry out experimental tests on cellular structures made of a nonlinear elastic material. This will offer opportunities for feed-back on the computational models and feed-forward for the design of new model structures of engineering interest for further testing and validation. 

Mathematical findings resulting from the project will also be included in the Finite Elasticity course for the fourth year MMath programme at Cardiff University, established by LAM in 2013-14. A new postgraduate-level course in Nonlinear Elasticity will also be introduced by LAM as part of the MAGIC (Mathematics Access Grid Instruction and Collaboration) programme funded by EPSRC. The MAGIC group contains 20 Universities across England and Wales, including Cardiff. 

ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. Cellular materials can be found in most things where light-weight, shock-absorbing, multi-functional materials are required, and although it is hard to make a precise estimate of how much they cost or what the value of those protected by them is, it is not difficult to appreciate their overwhelming importance for the economy and society. For example, many foams and sponges designed for cushioning and re-usability can be found in everyday life as well as in several industrial areas, e.g. microelectronics, aerospace, pharmaceutical and food processes. 

In the UK, the development of new flexible scaffolds for tissue re-growth in biomedical applications is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary area of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, which in turn underpins two of the current EPSRC Challenge Themes, namely Manufacturing the Future and Healthcare Technologies. In this context, the results of the proposed research will contribute to the development of associated research areas in material engineering, and may ultimately be used to optimize the design of cellular materials for highly flexible stents and soft tissue scaffolds, which are under continuing research and development. 

For these complex materials to be understood and optimised with respect to their mechanical response, reliable computer models based on rigorous mathematical mechanical analysis are needed and may open the way for new applications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93352</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Structures within Nature and Modern Engineering Applications, Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales), June 6, 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AD2B665-83FC-41CD-8E0B-D358B5BD8D1D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public outreach and media coverage

Among the best known mechanical qualities of cellular structures are their high strength-to-weight ratio and energy absorption capacity, which arise from the inextricable relation between the geometric architecture and the nonlinear elastic responses of their constituents. In many cellular structures, during functional deformations, plastic damage or fracture rarely occurs, and the material recovers completely after large deformations. Such deformations can be reasonably treated within the theoretical framework of large strain elasticity, which provides a complete description of the elastic responses of a solid material under loading. 

In our study, we showed how, for hyperelastic cellular bodies, several main factors determine the magnitude of the stress level in the cellular material, including the cell geometry, the cell wall thickness, and the presence of cell inclusions, and addressed the important question whether the same volume of material has the same effect when arranged as many cells or as fewer cells while the material volume remains fixed. To achieve this, we identified two nonlinear constitutive parameters, namely a nonlinear elastic modulus and a nonlinear Poisson's ratio defined in terms of the large stresses and strains in the elastic cell walls, and investigated their utility in estimating how different competing factors contribute to the complex mechanical behaviour of these structures. For the numerical investigation of these nonlinear parameters, finite element models of representative structures with a small number of square, diamond, or hexagonal cells made from a nonlinear hyperelastic material were constructed. In the computer simulations, the size of the cell and the size of the structure were comparable, and therefore the mechanical effects were visible simultanesouly at the cell level and also at the structural level. 

Analytically, we demonstrated that, for a single cell wall of homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, elastic material, subject to generic finite deformations, such as bending, straightening, or torsion, under certain restrictions, the nonlinear elastic modulus calculated as the ratio between the stress and the strain in the direction associated with the largest change of curvature is determined by: (i) the wall thickness, (ii) the number of cells, and (iii) the internal cell pressure, which when increased will cause the elastic modulus to increase. For a cellular structure which is extended in the vertical direction and contains walls that are inclined with respect to that direction, experimental and computational tests showed that the nonlinear Poisson's ratio defined as the negative quotient of the horizontal to the vertical strain decreases as the vertical extension increases. Analytically, we identified the inclination of the cell walls which are sheared while the cellular structure is stretched as contributing to this non-standard Poisson effect. 

Numerically, we extended our approach to the investigation of periodic cellular structures with different cell geometries. For finite element models of periodic structures made from neo-Hookean or Mooney-Rivlin material, we obtained that both the nonlinear elastic modulus calculated as the ratio between the mean effective stress and the mean effective logarithmic strain, and the nonlinear Poisson's ratio defined as the negative quotient of the mean value of the logarithmic horizontal strain to that of the logarithmic vertical strain in the solid walls while the structure is stretched vertically increase: (i) with the cell wall thickness and (ii) with the number of cells if the material volume in the structure is fixed. In addition, (iii) the nonlinear elastic modulus also increases as the modulus of the cell core increases. In all cases, the increase in the elastic modulus is due to the enhancement of the elastic behaviour of the deforming cell walls when more material is added or if the same solid material is distributed more uniformly throughout the structure, and also when the cells are filled. Due to their monotonic behaviour, the nonlinear elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio provide viable criteria for finding the optimum cell wall thickness, number of cells, and cell pressure in similar structures. 

In practice, the large strain deformations of many elastic solids under the action of various forces are typically more complex and diverse, but the deformations analysed by us have the advantage that they can be treated systematically and are tractable both theoretically and computationally. Other nonlinear parameters than the ones proposed here can also be defined and analysed, and we hope that our general approach will contribute to illuminate certain mechanical behaviour of cellular structures of nonlinear elastic material, which are typically difficult to optimise.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A linear-elastic (or Hookean) material can be characterised by two physical constants which may be found from simple uniaxial tension or compression experiments, namely the Young's modulus representing the slope of the stress-strain curve and the Poisson's ratio between the lateral and axial displacements. In contrast, the mechanical responses of nonlinear elastic materials are generally described by parameters which are scalar functions of the deformation. The aim is to determine constitutive material parameters within the theoretical framework of finite elasticity that enable us to identify nonlinear mechanical effects which play significant roles in applications. Specifically, nonlinear Poisson functions as well as nonlinear elastic and shear parameters can be defined, analysed, and applied to characterise solid materials which are elastically deformed.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2B5A5E07-A94E-42EE-8578-C8E21CF206DB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56af405eb4dd38.37027365</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Electronics,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98660-mihai-angela</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDF693CB-1B47-4AFA-A68E-150839789D14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hyperelastic bodies under homogeneous Cauchy stress induced by non-homogeneous finite deformations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/834ff1c36781b5f322f8eb1a714007d8"><gtr:id>834ff1c36781b5f322f8eb1a714007d8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mihai L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5899d8c27481b9.82064183</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AD6F6CA6-A74A-4498-A426-BA499C3374BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Strain smoothing for compressible and nearly-incompressible finite elasticity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Structures</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ffb24d3ccf4afc20a2ffdb9e1f11a63"><gtr:id>7ffb24d3ccf4afc20a2ffdb9e1f11a63</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589e1bb0124278.09579893</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5B0DD85-DA1A-4C54-812D-EDEB5C0DBC10</gtr:id><gtr:title>Microstructure-based hyperelastic models for closed-cell solids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
