&lt;p>Based on a broad view of health that includes mental, physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects, this project aims to develop new definitions of active, healthy ageing which include men and women who live in care homes and will identify strategies that enable residents to live more fulfilling lives. It will also identify strategies that promote the health of the labour force in care homes. We will explore the potential of such strategies to save resources by reducing the amount of medical and other care required as well as levels of staff sickness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This international project will use comparative case studies led by experienced national teams that will produce valuable data on the conditions that are the most promising in promoting healthy active ageing for residents and staff in specific care facilities in Canada, the UK, Sweden and Norway.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary


1. With its broad definition of health, an important aim of the project is to have an impact on how wellbeing is experienced and how the active ageing agenda can be pursued with people who are frequently regarded as beyond activity. The target groups for this impact include policy-makers, commissioners, service providers and practitioners in care homes. It is hoped also through partnerships with relevant organizations to have a broader impact on public perceptions. 

2. The project has the potential to refocus the perception of long-term residential care as places to live and work. This would lead to improvements in the overall approach to care and the management of care homes. It has the potential to prompt change in approaches to work organization and encourage informed advocacy and participation in decision-making in care homes. 

3. The project will develop new directions in research and scholarly debates on ageing, gender, work and policy. It will encourage an interest in the ageing of the long-term care workforce, The linkage of resident and staff perspectives is innovative and is expected to generate interest among researchers. The project will prompt new theoretical and empirical approaches; add to the gender-based analysis of health services; shift debates to healthy active ageing in residential care. 

4. The project will have methodological impacts, arising from both the international comparative site-switching approach and from the use of photovoice method. The methodology is adopted in order to demonstrate the possibilities and the desirability of enabling older people's voices to be heard.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118715</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>York University Toronto</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Reimagining Long-term Residential Care</gtr:description><gtr:id>2F839B8B-7141-4E7B-99AC-E295474FD2A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nursing Home Staffing Standards and Staffing Levels in Six Countries

What were the most significant achievements from the grant?

1.1 Methodological: 'fresh eyes' in rapid site-switching ethnography 
The rapid site switching method, which involved documentary analysis, observations of care home life (7am-midnight) and interviews with a broad range of stakeholders, has not been used in this sphere of research previously as far as we know. Overall, where the setting is amenable, it worked well and is recommended for future similar projects. In this project there were particular benefits from pairing 'foreign' with 'home' researchers. This highlighted practices in different countries, such as the range and type of activities for residents, which were more clearly perceived by those that were 'foreign' to particular settings. An example is the attitude to risk taking (see below).
1.2 Staffing: time to care and time to share 
The importance of adequate levels of front line staff cannot be overemphasised. We were acutely aware of the time pressures constantly experienced by care home staff and how promising practices, were often developed despite the time pressures. Time to care is about developing relationships with residents. This includes taking time during routine bodily care to have conversations with residents as well as spending additional time with them in non-routine activities. Using the time available to prioritise relationships promotes responsive, flexible care and boosts the staff members' knowledge of residents' health and state of mind. Time to share is about each staff member sharing their knowledge and experiences with others, including at shift handover. This ensures continuity of care and well-informed practice, fosters good team relationships, knowledge and confidence as well as promoting the care home's values. 

1.3 Attitudes towards risk taking 
Differences in attitudes to risk were evident within as well as between countries. 'Risky' activities included the use of knives by residents for food preparation, their independent access to tea and coffee making equipment and independent use of gym equipment. In some jurisdictions, fear of legal action by families could discourage giving residents the freedom to do things that carried any risk of injury but there were evident benefits when they did have that freedom. Residents, including those with dementia, were able to continue using lifelong skills and enjoy variety in their daily routine. The benefits were evident in their general wellbeing and enjoyment of life and it is probable that there are measurable physical health benefits also, although this study was not designed to capture these, and we can only suggest this, based on the accounts of staff and relatives. 

1.4 The environment of care: design that works in practice 

We observed several instances of excellent design that helped to promote health and wellbeing, as well as designs that were well-conceived but poorly executed - for example, a sensory garden with paths too narrow for wheelchair access. Good design, with attention to space, lighting, colours and materials, has evident potential to increase sensory pleasure, social interaction and psychological wellbeing. To work well in practice there should be good communication between care staff and designers. Care staff contributed to improving the environment of care in some homes by developing social areas and creating</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. We are continuing to work with the sister project based in Canada, Reimagining Long-term Residential Care, to produce:
- a book on the methodology applied both projects
- further publications for practitioners 
- research outputs
2. Lloyd and Szehebely are currently working on an article focused on the relationship between family members and residents. This will be of benefit to researchers in ageing, health and care as well as to organisations such as the Residents and Relatives Association
3. Lloyd already has working relationships with organisations such as Age UK, My Home Life and the National Care Forum and will negotiate with them to produce non-academic outputs of benefit to older people's groups. A high priority will be to identify what older people need to know about care homes in order to enable them to make informed choices about moving to one. 
4. Lloyd is a member of the National Care Homes Research &amp;amp; Development Forum which exchanges knowledge from research. 
5. Lloyd is a member of the 'Gerontology 8' group - researchers in ageing with a professional social work background - which is currently working with the DH on developing research-based learning resources on professional practice with older people. The findings from this project will feed directly into this work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D126CB4-51CA-45E7-BF46-BB9758853BB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464ab5f8141f5.82260658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://reltc.apps01.yorku.ca/related-projects</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>139A8230-9C0D-4CF9-8AF7-89CF47CE71D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Healthy Ageing in Residential Places: the HARP project.
