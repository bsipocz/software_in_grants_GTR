However, achieving social and economic development goals often requires ecosystem users and managers to make trade-offs between these services and to intervene in their management, impacting on services gained. In addition, ecosystem changes and natural resource management decisions link to wider environmental governance frameworks. Such tradeoffs, impacts and linkages are evident along the Pongola river floodplain in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. People living on the floodplain have experienced a significant change to the ecosystem services they receive due to the construction of the upstream Pongolapoort Dam. The increase in water provision primarily for the irrigation of commercially grown sugar cane and cotton has come at the expense of various provisioning, regulatory, supporting and cultural services previously available to downstream communities. The system is located in the extremely poor Umkhanyakude District which has a 53% unemployment rate, poor service provision and high incidence of disease. As a result the downstream communities are exceedingly reliant on the floodplain and associated ecosystem services which in turn are vulnerable to abuse. The proposed study aims to assess the ecosystem services that contribute to human welfare on the floodplain and to deepen the understanding of decision-makers, empowering them to consider the impacts of their actions on both ecosystem functioning and human wellbeing. To achieve this, the study will identify and categorise those ecosystem services produced by the system before and after construction of the Dam and identify and evaluate the elements of wellbeing for the Pongola community. Indicators and measures to represent the state of these ecosystems and human wellbeing will then be selected. This will include an economic evaluation of the ecosystem services and water/land productivity of the system both before and after construction of the dam. The linkages between the elements of wellbeing supported and affected by ecosystem services and similarly human activities which impact these services will be analysed to identify the relationships between environmental governance, these services and human wellbeing. Information from the indicators will be analysed to determine the current state of these services and human wellbeing and an historic change analysis will be conducted to determine trends in these services, possible causes of change and the associated impact on society. Finally, governance drivers which impact ecosystem services important to wellbeing will be identified, possible futures determined and suitable response strategies developed. Stakeholder consultation is a key component of the project and will be undertaken in all stages to facilitate the uptake of the knowledge developed. At present the limited use and understanding of wellbeing-ecosystem service information by management authorities is a major hindrance to the successful management of ecosystem services and the improvement of human wellbeing in the region. Key stakeholders include the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, who are currently responsible for managing the dam as well as the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Affairs and the Department of Health who are mandated to address many of the impacts of decreased ecosystem services such as reduced agricultural potential and increased disease thereby influencing poverty. A key component of the project will be to establish partnerships between these organizations and build capacity to improve understanding of the impacts on ecosystem services and the complex links to human wellbeing. By addressing natural resource governance, the project seeks to contribute to ecosystem conservation and improved human welfare, not only on the Pongola floodplain but in other river systems in South Africa and further afield.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Not to my knowledge - but the debate about how to use the Pongola Flood Plain for various purposes goes on in South Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3220032C-CBA3-402B-BBE5-36B7838954DD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545dad90536a14.02354365</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project 'PRESPA' completed a 160 page report that recorded our research on ecosystem services and poverty alleviation in the Pongola Floodplains South Africa; see www.uea.ac.uk/dev/prespa. The study assessed the ecosystem services that contribute to human welfare on the floodplain and, we believe our project deepened the understanding of decision-makers, empowering them to consider the impacts of their actions on both ecosystem functioning and human wellbeing. 



The study identified how ecosystem services on the floodplain had a changed as a result of construction of the Pongolapoort Dam. Indicators and measures to represent the state of these ecosystems and human wellbeing were selected for three main scenarios; unstructured (a version of today's governance characterisation); structured diversified (where both commercial agricultural interests and ecologically based poverty-alleviation concerns are balanced) and; structured single sector (where stakeholders promote commercial agriculture with consequences for poverty alleviation).



The project collected social survey and natural resource datasets, and built an excel model to determine the allocation of water to support livelihoods and related tradeoffs. We also developed water volumetric-based economic measures for ecosystem services, production, livelihoods and human wellbeing in the Pongola floodplain system. PRESPA explored the dimensions of well-being supported and affected by ecosystem services and human activities, plus assessed the governance and decision-making framework to select future alternatives and response strategies to deliver these. 



Stakeholder consultation was a key component of the project and was undertaken during the project at local resource user-level and with policy-makers including the Department for Water Affairs and the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Affairs at a major seminar in November 2009. At the local community level, PRESPA employed the river basin game with approximately 50 representatives to explore trade-offs and water allocation, leading to a more informed discussion regarding floodplain management. At these meetings, it was agreed that the limited use and understanding of wellbeing-ecosystem service information by the authorities was a major hindrance to the successful management of ecosystem services and improvement of human wellbeing. It was also agreed that the approach undertaken by PRESPA would greatly assist in the future management of the floodplain and the apportionment of water between major users of the waters of the Pongola River. In addition to our website, we posted a short video on YouTube.



The project sought to contribute to knowledge regarding ecosystem conservation and improved human welfare, not only on the Pongola floodplain but in other river systems in South Africa and further afield. The link to the project website and associated documents will be circulated to all members of the South African National Biodiversity Institute's stakeholder group which includes members from across South Africa and other SADC countries. This link will also be emailed to members of the South African Wetlands Forum. 



We successfully engaged in the theory of ecosystems services, and defined how water management efficiency within systems might be used to offer services elsewhere, and will be reflecting more on this as a part of our planned papers.



We built significant collaborative links between the University of East Anglia and the Institute of Natural Resources, which included research experience for early career researchers (Pringle, Goulden, Chhotray, and Nxele). We hope to take this partnership forward in the form of a larger bid for ESPA project, scaling up our research to include a larger part of the Maputo Basin, within which the Pongola sits, also incorporating Swaziland and Mozambique as transboundary partners.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72322F6A-B2A4-46B4-9F9C-0AB2765AB1E2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7503726982.980712779cdc10</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/G008213/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12C7A68B-3922-4925-9C0B-7FACEC921815</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecosystem Scale Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D4F391DF-BCE0-47FA-BED7-78025F16B14D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrological Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
