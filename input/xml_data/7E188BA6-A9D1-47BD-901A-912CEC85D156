Industry workers are intent on controlling copyright in the face of changing technologies, policymakers are concerned with the effect of illegal downloading on the larger cultural economy, ISPs are forced to defend their roles and responsibilities, and users are navigating morally and legally murky terrain in their pursuit of digital media.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The maintenance of copyright as the foundation on which a healthy creative industry depends is reflected in government policies such as the Digital Economy Act, but such efforts to justify copyright protection are not always successful: smaller producers, ISPs and users all offer alternative views of copyright.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to explore the complex and varied justificatory discourses about copyright within key industrial and cultural contexts.Through multimodal discourse analysis, it will shed light on the complexities of the copyright debate in the digital age by exploring why and how users, policymakers, internet service providers and producers construct, distribute and maintain ideological justifications around copyright.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>122702</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organised event at RSA House: Copyright in the digital age: what users say and do about intellectual property</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8903DEF6-1B2A-4567-8C66-65B3BFCE6B8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A half-day seminar was held at RSA House in London for policymakers, consumer group members, researchers and industry workers, reflecting on the results of the Communicating Copyright project. As well as a presentation of the research findings, the programme included an opening keynote from Professor Ian Hargreaves, Chair of Digital Economy at Cardiff University and author of Digital Opportunity: A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth; a keynote response by Jim Killock, Chair of Open Rights Group; a talk from John McVay, Chief Executive of Pact (Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television) and Deputy Chair, Creative Coalition Campaign; and closing remarks from Helen Goodman MP, who considered implications of the research for the future of policymaking.

Representatives from government bodies and parliament (IPO, Ofcom, Shadow Minister for Culture, Media and Sport) and relevant companies and organisations (BBC, ITV, Google, HarperCollins, Warner Music and the British Library) attended the organised event. The research team has received follow-up inquiries from multiple delegates and Helen Goodman MP noted that the research had convinced her to move forward with a consultation with young people about the implementation of the Digital Economy Act 2010. The research has been commended by public policy organisations such as the Open Rights Group, and has coincided with related policy research into user behaviour, such as Ofcom's 2012 report on copyright infringing behaviour.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7293501521.7340572b336ab0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk at the Music Research Seminar Series, University of Edinburgh: Out of tune: music copyright and the public</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EADE6887-00BA-455D-A2DC-385DDD67D8B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This invited talk considered cases of music licensing, sampling and downloading that have encouraged users to engage in debate and discussion about copyright.

A brief outline of the chapter based on the Communicating Copyright project was presented. The chapter considers modern copyright debates as involving a range of implicit and explicit justifications communicated by government, industry, artists and users. It was a valuable opportunity for scholars from around the world and different disciplines to come together.

As a result of the symposium, the Handbook to which presenters have contributed reflect hangs together more naturally in terms of themes covered than other similar volumes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6589012180.0722672b1b2d7e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk at the CREATe Researchers Conference and Empirical Capacity Building Event: Communicating Copyright Project: Methodological Reflections</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6CB52A91-351E-48EA-A876-E7B76A42BA7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper introduced the methods of the Communicating Copyright project and discussed the methodological choices.

This talk connected historical characterisations of copyright infringement and the role of the public interest in the development of copyright law and policy with the complex experience of modern, ordinary users of digital media. Users were proposed not as transgressors to be educated, regulated or scared straight, nor as a hazy and largely silent public, but as sources of legitimate perspectives that could contribute to conversations about media, creativity and regulation. The talk was followed by a valuable discussion among colleagues researching in similar and related areas.

After the talk, I have continued to stay in contact with researchers in the department.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-774353761.9471122ab203a8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project considered modern copyright debates as involving a range of implicit and explicit justifications communicated by government, industry, artists and users. In order to explore the communication strategies and justifications employed in industry and government discourses, PR, marketing, and educational campaigns of rights holders and alternative messages circulated in the public sphere by campaign groups were examined. User perspectives were analysed as sources of legitimate perspectives that could contribute to conversations about media, creativity and regulation. Findings illustrated how discourse plays a strategic role in promoting the interests of particular social groups and how justifications frequently draw on more general principles that transcend specific interests and extend the scope for contestation. Users offered complex, rational and cynical justifications of digital media activities, challenging superficial characterisations of users and demonstrating the value of users' voices in policymaking processes.

This project has contributed new ways of thinking about copyright through both theoretical and methodological interventions. Through its theoretical positioning of copyright in terms of the sociology of justification and discursive processes of legitimation, the project shifts the focus from the efficacy of regulation and legal challenges of copyright to the power struggles that underpin debates about copyright and attendant policy development. The deployment of discourse analysis allows for how rights holders in the film, music, and television industries have used discourse in order to legitimate and further their position in the digital copyright debate. Analysis of focus groups offers a portrait of the range of claims expressed by users and provides a space for user voices - largely absent or superficial in industry, policy and academic research - to be heard.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As well as the three articles and book chapter which emerged from the research, a book drawing on the research (Understanding Copyright: Intellectual Property in the Digital Age) was published in 2015. We anticipate that the book will become a key resource for students and scholars of copyright. We hope that the findings and publications will also contribute to future policy debates on copyright.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1CC1E708-C830-45CF-8445-142C8AD7A88F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ba12eea070f3.70171011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A4853BE-BBAF-43D2-93C9-09329DE8AA3A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding Copyright: Intellectual Property in the Digital Age</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b31341687c99acc7b58b708bb83effc1"><gtr:id>b31341687c99acc7b58b708bb83effc1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Klein Bethany</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781446285848</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545caf66f0a131.51940335</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>335A2190-0EAA-4F90-8DE0-C24468F1556C</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Isn't it just a way to protect Walt Disney's rights?': Media user perspectives on copyright</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Media &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385"><gtr:id>7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfaafaa9d0cb8c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A833DC4E-01E0-42F7-BE75-C7FB75F72B81</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discourse, justification and critique: towards a legitimate digital copyright regime?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Cultural Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385"><gtr:id>7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543fc67b770a54.74369079</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3D2356B-A694-4129-8CC8-0549A1D459A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The SAGE Handbook of Intellectual Property</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385"><gtr:id>7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781446266342</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cd2b27090e8.27425832</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>431650C1-7154-42BF-9309-9C2C2E18492B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Framing the consumer</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385"><gtr:id>7906e4f7d7683a3ba88f3098b7e37385</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfaafaa6e8ace6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I019693/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-3027</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
