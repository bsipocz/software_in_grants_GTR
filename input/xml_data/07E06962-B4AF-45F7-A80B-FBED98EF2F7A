It has become clear though that this process is, especially in its early stages very similar in animals as different as a fly and human. Since most processes in living organisms are ultimately driven by gene products, it is not surprising that with the current advances in gene technology, many of the crucial processes in the embryo are now investigated in animals where such studies are highly amenable. One such animal is the fruitfly. We study the processes controlled by a single gene product. And remarkably certain processes such as the generation of the front to back axis of the hand (formation of the different fingers) are comparable to the generation of a proper fly wing, both controlled by the same gene. Since this gene controls such essential processes, inadvertent activation can cause severe problems: a known problem is a common type of skin cancer. In addition, any highly conserved gene, such as the SMN gene that causes Spinal Muscular Atrophy in humans, can be studied directly in the fly. We have isolated and characterised a fly mutant in this gene and by subsequent studies have added considerable knowledge to the field that should eventually help to develop therapeutics. We hope that through studying these genes in flies, we will not only understand how they function but our studies should lead to additional drug targets as well the potential to develop drugs directly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cellular communication events are essential during animal (and human) development. Such signalling between cells ensures a proper lay-out of the animal as well as controlling size and shape. The signalling molecules underlying these processes are now well known. Their roles are however not limited to early life but can be both beneficial as well as detrimental in adult life. For instance, the signalling molecule under investigation here, Hedgehog (Hh) is able to switch the neurotransmitter fate of particular neurons, this could be beneficial for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. On the other side, activating the signalling pathway downstream of Hh in human adult skin leads to particular type of skin cancers. The aim of this research project is to establish the functions of the Hh molecules and to understand how the molecule evokes his different effects. To characterise genes in the fly underlying known human neurodegenerative disorders, we have isolated mutants in a gene known to cause a lower motor neuron specific recessive disorder called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The motor phenotypes in this fly mutant have characterised. The D. melanogaster model system will be used for these studies. Its strong genetics plus the fact that the full genome sequence of the animal is now known, allows a thorough approach to the above problems. The fly only has one Hh gene and most of what we know of the downstream events in the Hh signalling pathway stems form the research in the fly. Directed genetic screens will be used to find additional components required for Hh signalling. These and known components will be analysed genetically and biochemically; the latter using both traditional as well as proteomic techniques. These studies will identify putative drug targets.||In addition to the studies of Hh signalling, the project to analyse the role of the Spinal Muscular Atrophy gene (smn) in the fly will continue. A single homologous smn gene is present in the fly and a mutant has been isolated. The studies are currently concentrating on the function of the gene in D. melanogaster and a mutagenesis screen to isolate interacting partners is ongoing. These studies should lead to a better understanding of the underlying cause of the human disease which is currently not known. In addition, a direct durg screen using our mutant animals is taking shape in collaboration with a Biotechnology company. All of this work relies on the strength of D. melanogaster techniques such as the easy generation of transgenic flies, the availability of clonal techniques to both generate both positive as well as negatively influences on gene expression and the recent advances in cell biology and cell labelling. Genomics technology, in the form of micro-array analysis has been applied to both projects.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1999-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EADCF6B8-19F9-40B7-A4C1-2078FC115A56</gtr:id><gtr:title>The fly as a model for neurodegenerative diseases: is it worth the jump?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuro-degenerative diseases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/671398da747efd7dae05e8e3deb12d96"><gtr:id>671398da747efd7dae05e8e3deb12d96</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cauchi RJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2006-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1660-2854</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>C61F561E6F6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>97063D14-FB44-4963-8289-092F10DCEE79</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drosophila SnoN modulates growth and patterning by antagonizing TGF-beta signalling.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mechanisms of development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5fb5e8bd3f76ece20d8e52a2fc867ce0"><gtr:id>5fb5e8bd3f76ece20d8e52a2fc867ce0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ramel MC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0925-4773</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>C50C043D619</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B25E0608-0358-4850-8A28-CAB065D552F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>An amphioxus Gli gene reveals conservation of midline patterning and the evolution of hedgehog signalling diversity in chordates.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b1ea824c63f520322c9ec306ed6451e4"><gtr:id>b1ea824c63f520322c9ec306ed6451e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shimeld SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>DF98EC5A574</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U137761451</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
