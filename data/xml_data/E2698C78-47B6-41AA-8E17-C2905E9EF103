Innovation is being developed with regard to the processing methods, calibration / validation processes and demonstration applications that can be scaled-up to run across large areas on a continual basis, delivering actionable content to be used by national agencies and businesses. The project will make use of a new Earth Observation data management facility (EO Lab) being established at Agrimetrics and will be an early demonstrator project of how big spatial data management systems can support the growth of agricultural information services in UK and export markets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this research will be largely defined by its impact on regulation services and polity and well as business
opportunities. The opportunity is in providing EO derived information on agricultural compliance to regulators (Defra, RPA,
SEPA, Natural England in the UK and equivalents in other countries) and productivity estimates for the private sector (agrifinance,
suppliers, processors and businesses in the bio-based economy). 

Specific opportunities presented by Copernicus (Sentinels 1 and 2) addressed by this project include monitoring of
environmental compliance indicators at local landscape (field and sub-field) and regional (farm and catchment) levels,
notably the extent and condition of natural vegetation relevant to greening measures under CAP, and soil moisture
extremes such as waterlogging, ponding and runoff. While Sentinel resolution data (10m to 20m pixels) are too coarse for
determination compliance of field level features such as hedgerows and buffer strips, preliminary work by Environment
Systems and Ecometrica has demonstrated the potential for identifying areas at risk and areas undergoing change so that
(scarce and costly) ground based inspection or commercial high resolution remote sensing can be used more effectively
and efficiently.

Related EO derived vegetation and soil indicators provide information about changes in productivity and actual v potential
the information is of wide interest to the food and agriculture industry. The global market for EO derived content in agriculture and land use is at an early stage of development, estimated at $200 million per year (NSR) and expected to double within ten years. Until recently the scope of information products has been limited by the coverage, continuity and quality of free / low cost primary satellite data. There is a potential for rapid growth in this market exploiting the volume, quality and continuity of free data from Europe's constellation of Sentinels.

Short Term Opportunities
The commercial partners each expect to generate additional revenues of &amp;pound;1m to &amp;pound;2m per year within 2 years of project completion from near term opportunities in the UK. Ecometrica and Environment Systems have initial expressions of interest from UK institutions that would generate from landscape level compliance indicators (vegetation extent, condition and soil moisture related products).

Medium Term Opportunities
Ecometrica has established initial customer engagements with agricultural credit agencies and food companies in Brazil, where the compliance and productivity monitoring market shows great potential. Environment Systems has established initial, project based, sales in Peru, Georgia and Turkey, which all show potential for scaling up if technical hurdles can be overcome. We estimate market potentials of &amp;pound;2m to &amp;pound;3m per year within 3 years of project completion.

Direct commercialisation by Ecometrica and Environment Systems via existing channels
Both companies have their own processes for building sales pipelines within the agri-compliance and production arena, and both have on-going sales efforts within the private and public segments of target markets. Specifically, Ecometrica will build upon its contacts in UK agencies (Defra, SEPA, Environment Agency, Water Authorities and others) dealing with soil moisture issues relating to compliance and hazard management relating to runoff, erosion and flooding, including water retention plans. In Brazil with rural investment banks subject to new agricultural compliance monitoring requirements and in China, where the STFC - Newton Agritech project is expected to open new opportunities. Environment Systems have established business relationships with government agricultural agencies (Defra, RPA, Welsh Government, Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and others) and global agriculture businesses (including AB Sugar, grape growers in Peru and agri-insurance in Georgia).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>225662</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P008852/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6CA01F47-BDE6-46F1-8679-A31D5317A885</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
