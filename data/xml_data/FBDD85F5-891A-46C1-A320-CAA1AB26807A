Enterprise in Arts and Creative Technologies.

Knowledge Exchange gets lost in translation. Creative Economy demand and Arts and Humanities research culture too routinely fail to understand each other. They can seem to work to different rhythms and values. But they do and they must match, and they must talk, urgently. We will make that happen. REACT will engineer the radical change needed through its unique partnership with a leading Creative Economy broker, Watershed, pioneering a new model of dynamic creative interaction: Sandbox. REACT will match Creative Economy demand with Arts and Humanities excellence, creating sustainable partnerships that will provide significant economic and societal impacts, generating a transformative shift in capacity and HEI cultures at all levels. We will bring two cultures together and lead the necessary process of organisational change. Within four years we will have demonstrated the value of sustained tight integration of the CE sector and AH communities, and secured national and international recognition for our agile mechanism for dynamic knowledge exchange. 

The REACT Hub is a collaboration between the University of the West of England, Watershed Arts Trust, and the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter. It reaches across two dynamic UK regions, and uniquely across three cultural areas and two languages and creative economies. It brings together Arts &amp;amp; Humanities research from fields as diverse as Archaeology, Architecture, Classics, History, English, Welsh, Translation Studies, Performance, Media and Cultural Studies, Design, Music, Computer Science and Digital Technologies. REACT will offer researchers the chance to work with Micro businesses and SMEs, technology partners from either the commercial sector or the partner HEIs and larger scale Cultural Economy and Cultural Industry partners who have an interest in new creative content, and assets to exploit in partnership with academics. REACT will bring together high quality academic research with creative technology partners to developing innovative ways of engaging audiences. Creative economy partners will have the opportunity to develop new delivery platforms and researchers will be able to engage with audiences in new ways.

REACT Universities have teamed up Bristol's Watershed Media Centre to adapt their ground breaking innovation development programme, Sandbox, for working with academic researchers. This programme is supported by the University of Exeter's Innovation Fitness Test offering participating Creative Economy partners the chance to strengthen their market potential. Watershed's Sandbox brings together production teams around themed cohorts to make practice based prototypes; production teams follow a common timetable of development and testing, sharing their learning with one another across the cohort. This proven method aggregates ideas, talent and resources harnessing powerful outputs from diverse cross disciplinary inputs. See http://www.theatresandbox.co.uk/2010-evaluation/ for an evaluation of the 20101 Theatre Sandbox scheme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our key target sectors for CE impact are 1) Micro businesses and SMEs in the creative communications, design and technology sector; these inlude individual artists, start ups to medium size agencies who are likely to be the primary collaborators with many AH researchers, providing them with media, design and delivery expertise. Operations at this scale have both the agility and the motivation to experiment in the REACT process. 2) Technology partners from either the commercial sector or the partner HEIs; they offer REACT innovative platform support, e.g. sensor based delivery methods, interactive projection techniques, high definition imaging, high bandwidth computer networks, leading edge data, text and picture mining. Their motivation is access to a testbedfor new technologies on live projects. 3) Larger scale Cultural Economy and Cultural Industry partners (eg BBC, Tate St Ives, the National Trust, English Heritage) who have cultural assets to exploit in partnership with academics and an acute interest in developing innovative ways of engaging audiences. The REACT delivery plan highlights the necessity of brokerage and development - the iShed input to the hub provides us with essential experience in CE brokerage that is nationally recognised. Two phases per year will be devoted to forming partnerships and seeking opportunities to bring new partners and investment into the process. The success of this process depends on the qualities of cultural entrepreneurship we can foster in REACT - here the quality of the inputs from the Executive Producer and the Producers will be central. The support team will work closely with the Advisory Board to predict emergent market needs and formulate themes accordingly . For instance we know that IPTV will be coming on stream during the life of the Hub which will afford new opportunities for interactive programming; the 'internet of things' will move a step closer when smart phones are equipped with RFID readers affording the potential for objects to become media. We have good evidence that the method we are incorporating into REACT stimulates entrepreneurial activity. iShed's Sandbox methodology was developed in 2008 with the inaugural Media Sandbox, an annual scheme for six companies. In 2010 Theatre Sandbox was also launched (nationally). These schemes have now supported 23 companies with partners including HP Labs, Aardman, Microsoft, BBC, Ogilvy, iNets and DCMS. Sandbox projects have gone on to receive funding from Technology Strategy Board and Arts Council England as well commissions from brands and organisations including BBC, HP Labs, CITIN, UKTI, Samsung, Bluevia, Tate Modern, British Red Cross, National Trust and Soho Theatre amongst others. Examples of successes from previous Sandbox iterations point to the kinds of impact we can expect to achieve; shortly after completing Media Sandbox, Mobile game developer Mobile Pie won Channel 4's New Mobile Developer of the Year (MS08); AntiVJ have won global success and commissions using their mapping software (MS09); after building an RFID system for Proto-type Theater, Tim Kindberg secured a Technology Strategy Board grant to develop a commercial solution. He has since produced his first commercial campaign for Ford Focus live (TS10); start-up Mutant Labs have won commissions from Aardman and Mobile Pie through connections made by the Advisory Group (MS10); Nu Desine's Alphasphere musical instrument has received product design, electronics and music technology input from academics at both UWE and UoB. The project recruited 5 student interns, is currently negotiating an investment deal and has produced a fully functioning prototype; in 2011, Media Sandbox projects were showcased at SXSW in Austin, US and FutureEverything, Manchester. The Bristol REACT base will be co located with the National Centre for Public Engagement in the Watershed offering immediate expertise in introducing our work to public audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4110304</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Reflector augments lessons, using a tactile, movement activated internet-connected object to reveal stories behind rare artefacts.

Stand + Stare started out creating interactive exhibitions and installations for museums, theatres, libraries and
festivals. Through involvement with REACT they have forged a new collaboration, developed an innovative new
product called 'Mayfly' and are on their way to taking it to market. They are an example of what happens when brilliant
creatives are supported to collaborate, helped to innovate and inspired to grow their business in new directions
&amp;quot;REACT has had (and is still having) a huge impact on our work and our future. Support through pump priming,
feasibility and now the alumni scheme has helped us to develop our project Mayfly, which will soon be a new
company. REACT brought us and Professor Tim Cole together, which has led to us setting up a business together as
joint directors, and also working together on another project through the University of Bristol. We are learning a host of
new skills, from app and book design to entrepreneurship and understanding retail. We all feel like we are embarking
on a new journey and incredibly lucky to have REACT there supporting us and guiding us as we take flight!&amp;quot; - Lucy
and Barney Heywood, Stand + Stare
Stand + Stare's co-directors, Barney Heywood and Lucy Heywood, have been residents at Watershed's Pervasive Media Studio since 2011, where a small grant had allowed them to produce Theatre Jukebox, an interactive
installation that uses real objects to trigger audio and video archive material. Their journey with REACT began with a
pump-priming grant in 2013, where they worked with Tim Cole, Professor of History at the University of Bristol to
develop Turning the Page, an installation in Bristol Central Library for theatre festival Mayfest. Turning the Page used
image recognition to trigger audio recordings within a guidebook to China. This project drew on Stand + Stare's
approach to installation which combines documentary or archival material with a narrative emphasis, and digital
technology to allow people encountering their work to interact in new ways.
The team felt Turning the Page was successful on its own terms, but had limitations regarding portability and
scalability. It was then the collaboration came up with the idea for Mayfly. Mayfly Sound Journal is a travel journal with
an accompanying iPhone app that allows you to make sound recordings and embed them in your travel journal. The
idea employs the same technology as Turning the Page, but within an app to make the installation a scalable,
sharable product. This reflects Tim Cole's research interest in travel and tourism and new narrative forms, based on
his existing research at the University of Bristol. They were awarded REACT Feasibility funding to develop Mayfly
Sound Journal. The funding allowed them to test using the first demo app with prototype books handmade by Stand +
Stare, and the team have now won support from REACT's Alumni Scheme working with business accelerator
Upstarter.
The team credits REACT for giving them space and time to explore and grow the ideas coming from their
collaboration. As Lucy says, &amp;quot;we had no idea this is what we were working towards&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;getting to think in a way
we didn't know we could think&amp;quot; has enabled the team to develop a core business in a wholly new way. Barney
describes how collaborating with Tim &amp;quot;injected new energy&amp;quot; and new sets of skills into their work, and Tim
describes the experience as a &amp;quot;true collaboration&amp;quot;. It has certainly proved durable with the team establishing
Mayfly as a business in which Stand + Stare and Tim Cole will become equal partners and Co-Directors.
The Mayfly example demonstrates how small artistic companies within a network can be supported to diversify their
practices and develop new products that are not reducible to standard distinctions between 'commercial' or 'cultural'
products. For the team, this is about empowering creativity around memory and stories in other people. Cole says,
&amp;quot;for all of us it is a shift [from being storytellers] to a canvas for others to tell their stories&amp;quot;. For Stand + Stare, this
enables the company to become known as one with a distinct and recognizable style that can be applied across
multiple platforms, which explores the interface between contemporary commercial and artistic work. Moreover, Mayfly
offers the chance to bring elements of Barney and Lucy's artistic practice, their freelance commercial design
experience, and community building learned in theatre, together in a robust business proposition.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc78b278ec44.95250479</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mayfly</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/alumni/mayfly</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The world's first gaming robots, Mecha Monsters is a collaboration between Silas Adekunle of Reach Robotics and Esther MacCallum-Stewart and Seth Giddings of the Digital Cultures Research Centre, UWE Bristol.

Reach Robotics are creating Mecha Monsters, robots controlled via mobile phones that battle with one another at the player's feet and have teamed up with experts in gaming cultures from the University of West of England to explore how players interact with the robots. They found gamers create vibrant cultures which include fan practices, discussions and transmedia products such as Let's Play videos, reviews and playtests. The ambition is to create a robotic gaming world that inspires people to have fun and learn more about robotics, technology and engineering.</gtr:description><gtr:id>68594204-EF8B-41D3-BD85-F61C8A4EBED3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reach Robotics: the journey of a robotics entrepreneur - &amp;pound;1.1m investment.
Reach Robotics was founded by Silas Adekunle while still an undergraduate at UWE Bristol. As a graduate robotics
engineer, lifelong hobby robot enthusiast, gamer and STEM advocate for the Prince's trust, Silas has gone on to
position Reach Robotics at the intersection between gaming, technology and education. Reach Robotics aim to make
a lasting impression on people (particularly the young) by using robotics and games to engage people in the world of
science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).
Silas was awarded Prototype Funding in 2013, and Play Sandbox in 2014 to develop two Reach Robotics products,
MechaMonsters and Mighty Minis. MechaMonsters are the world's first customisable, battling robots, controlled by the
users' smartphones. Mighty Minis are a series of toys that use collectible objects which respond to a user's physical
activity and translate them to the growth of a dynamic online character. Reach employed two people at the time they
first engaged with REACT.
Silas' REACT collaborations have created connections, generated insights into his audience and helped inform robust
prototypes in the field of robotics gaming. Silas collaborated with Dr Seth Giddings, a lecturer and researcher into
theories of play, and Dr Esther MacCallum-Stewart, a Research Fellow at the Digital Cultures Research Centre, UWE
across his REACT projects. Much of this work has involved working with the researchers on understanding how
gamers, and specifically children, engage with toys, create story-worlds and interact with technology. This has entailed
working with a group of Young Coaches on Mighty Minis to establish the story world and background to the Mighty
Minis, as well as providing them with an imaginative tool that they want to engage with. This is one of the core areas
identified by Reach Robotics as requiring more investigation, and also at the heart of Dr MacCallum-Stewart's work,
which examines the ways that players understand games and subsequently engage with them. Silas believes that
having user engagement in product design is incredibly important in his sector, but notes it rarely happens. Esther's
involvement has been essential in helping the team to &amp;quot;decipher the users&amp;quot; of the products.
Reach became one of 8 companies chosen to be part of our Alumnni Scheme, and the legal and business support
offered here, along with the insights he generated working with researchers on his Prototype and Play Sandbox work,
equipped him to take he company to the next level. He also credits REACT with strong connections he's made to take
the company forward. His work has received Press coverage in Sky News, Bloomberg and other outlets. Reach
Robotics was accepted onto the prestigious Qualcomm Robotics Accelerator, powered by Techstars in San Diego.
The company were also part of REACT's Alumni Scheme, working with REACT and Station 12 to develop their
company, project and continues to work with Esther on their research collaboration.
Reach Robotics now have 6 employees, thanks to being part of the accelerator and subsequent investments. They
are now at a stage where they are about to close a &amp;pound;1.1m seed investment round and will be hiring an additional 4 to 5
employees. The product is also now at a stage where they are finalizing a manufacturing contract with their chosen !
contract manufacturer. Their plan for 2016 is to launch a presales campaign in Q3 of 2016 and ship the product by
Xmas. This will be the trigger event for the next raise of the company as they prepare to scale. 2017 will be a focus on
scaling and setting up their distribution and plan to secure a major licensing deal in 2016 or 2017.
&amp;quot;Product development has a life cycle of prototyping, testing, manufacture but Play Sandbox had a built in feedback
loop which was really important. Being able to have an opinion at every stage and not second guessing, I think
every company should be doing it&amp;quot; - Silas Adekunle</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7a4007d389.27601589</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mecha Monsters</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/prototype-alumni/mecha-monsters</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exploring the playground of the future with a digitally enhanced set of swings .

Through the lens of this fascinating woman, Nicola Thomas of University of Exeter and Bow Software set out to break new digital ground in the genre of biography by creating an experience in which your curiosity leads your interaction with the source materials.

Providing an important voice for Peru's hard to reach communities this project aims for maximum possible participation. By combining low and high-tech technologies, Quipu records and distributes personal oral histories, alongside an audio-based interactive platform connecting this living documentary to the rest of the world. Chaka Studio is a media production company specialising in documentary and interactive narrative. Their goal is to become industry leaders in this space by placing collaboration and co-creation at the heart of their practice. The Quipu Project is an interactive documentary about the men and women who were sterilised in Peru in the mid 1990s without consent and who are still seeking justice. At its core it is a unique method for online participation and civic engagement - an interactive phone line directly linked to a live website. This partnership will allow the team to explore the potential of this method and learn how to abstract the key principles into the fields of civic engagement, academia, social activism and third sector activity.

Challenged public to explore intersections between historical and scientific data. The Ivory Bangle Lady team developed 'I Tweet Dead People', a Twitter and SMS-activated video and audio trail across the museum. The museum visitor responds to clues and information found in the exhibition space by connecting with the Ivory Bangle Lady on Twitter and SMS. The result is an entertaining, informative treasure hunt in which visitors interact, turn around, engage, break tracks and break ranks to explore the Ivory Bangle Lady's past. Connections between objects and places in the museum are forged, riddles are solved, answers tweeted and video projections spring to life. 
The Ivory Bangle Lady has now been laid out with her burial goods for the first time in over 100 years, according to the ethical standards upheld by the project team. The team explored how to tell the story of the Ivory Bangle Lady, and to promote the science behind research that uses human remains. The strongly shared ethos of the project team, the innovative repurposing of contemporary social media and a deep understanding of the subject matter came together to make 'I Tweet Dead People' an innovative and compelling means of interacting with the past.

Ghosts in the Garden takes audiences on a journey to rediscover the physical space of the modern park with its own past as a pleasure garden. Present-day visitors meet and interact with real characters from the Gardens' heyday, in a game where history, stories and imagination meet. Splash and Ripple are 'Architects of Extraordinary Adventures.' Their mission is to make beautiful, genuinely moving experiences that put the participants at the centre of the action. These experiences are intensified through being set in the real world where normality is suspended. Their two major projects - Ghosts in the Garden and A Knight's Peril - offer heritage sites a radical new approach to interpretation using new technology and game design. The collaboration will evaluate the impact, on both the 'public' and the industry, of co-designed, non-linear, playful, affective and experiential group learning.

With Ghosts in the Garden, the company has now diversified to have a reproducible product 'kit' that can be installed in a number of different sites. This creates a new potential revenue stream for the company.

Do our minds control our bodies or are we compelled by urges, compulsions and appetites? When gothic novels were first written, their pace and content were designed to raise heart beats and send shivers down the spine. Using participants' bio-data to shape the experience, Hyde is a pervasive media adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde. Part game, part theatrical production, it is an embodied novel that reclaims the transgressive power of Robert Louis Stevenson's writing. Once equipped the player can interact with the maze by blowing open doors, holding one's breath to solve puzzles or raising one's heartbeat for hints. Inside the maze is Hyde, who is hunting you down. Slingshot make and stage games; from mass participation spectaculars to mobile phone adventures. Hyde will be a visitor attraction, a permanent installation that visitors will purchase tickets to visit and play in. Imagine the London Dungeon meets the video game Portal, with a Jekyll and Hyde theme. This project will seek to deliver a full-scale prototype of the bio-activated horror maze. Anthony Mandal will work with SlingShot on game design (e.g. mechanics, imagery, themes, adaptation of the literary elements) and preparing necessary content, and will undertake additional research on Stevenson, which will feed back into the project.

In this fast paced digital world we often feel isolated distant from the people we love. The smartphone may allow us to connect almost anywhere at any time, but although we are always connected, are we really InTouch?
The research and design project InTouch hopes to make that moment of connection bring us closer together. Using haptic technology, InTouch are exploring new ways to allow us all to reach out and touch those who mean the most to us at that very moment in time when we need each other the most.

This project led to a number of impacts. It enabled KD to explore the emerging 'internet of things' market away from the immediate commercial constraints of a client contract. In new sectors, where the demand is not yet proven and the technology relatively untested, it can be difficult for companies to invest in their team's own skills and experience. Second, the collaboration with Bristol's Medical Humanities and Computer Science departments contributed directly into the product development but also engendered a depth and rigour which ensured that the outcomes are able to feed into the company's wider portfolio. Finally, the Sandbox experience directly led to the establishment of an internal rapid prototyping system at KD. This has allowed them to continue to explore and innovate effectively, by being able to demonstrate proof of concept and develop ideas with clients more rapidly than they have other done before. This has contributed to new business.

A digital co-creation service and platform enabling aduls to re-imagine, design and create intimate objects. A collaboration between designer, Cassie Robinson and Mwenza Blell, School of Arts, University of Bristol. 
Intimate Objects is a digital co-creation service and platform (supported and informed by in-person Intimacy Labs) that provides an intimate, virtual space for connection and creativity. It enables adult users to re-imagine, design and create intimate objects for communication, discovery and expression of their sexual desires, and more broadly, all aspects of their intimate lives.

The project is fundamentally informed by an anthropological perspective on intimacy, sexuality and the generative capacity of everyday actions. Research has highlighted diversity in sexual practices and identities and the role of context in shaping these. The focus on the creation of the intimate online space recognises that actions create their own kinds of time and space and enables the objects to emerge from a relational context.

Intimate Objects developed two previous projects: Intimacy Lab, held at the Barbican in August 2013 and the Royal Festival Hall in March 2014, which explored the design experience and an intimacy workshop at A-Camp, an Autostraddle weekend with queer-identified women in October 2013, which explored the potential market.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C42419C6-105D-492D-BF69-F14DB43E5909</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Intimate Objects developed two projects: Intimacy Lab, held at the Barbican in August 2013 and the Royal Festival Hall in March 2014, which explored the design experience and an intimacy workshop at A-Camp, an Autostraddle weekend with queer-identified women in October 2013, which explored the potential mark</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc75aa53c887.51897981</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Intimate Objects</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/prototype/intimate-objects</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Rethinking sex education through ancient objects This project brings together experts in the history of sex and sexual knowledge with game makers to change the face of sex education.

worlds and species evolve, change, grow and battle in relation to the physical blocks. Every time you successfully
stack an Artefact, you alter the connected digital world. The aim is to make the most fabulous world you can, before a
tower collapses.
This innovative digital/physical game was devised by Alex Fleetwood (Sensible Object) and Elies Dekoninck
(University of Bath). The collaboration bought together skills in games design, storytelling, industrial design and
prototyping and creative methodologies to create the game. A unique mixture of an academic understanding both the
creative process at work in design and manufacture and the technical demands of prototyping, and a business
understanding of games design and creative entrepreneurialism has led to an exciting new product.
Alex formed a company to produce the product, which now employs 6 people and has secured &amp;pound;150k in private
investment to take the product forward. The full product range features variants of the stackable objects, including a
fully customisable 'Maker Set'. In total they have 4 discrete product variations of the game. They ran a successful
Kickstarter campaign in February 2016, raising over &amp;pound;150k. The first products will be on the market in time for
Christmas shopping season 2016. The team is approaching the production run of its first games. It has experienced
partners in Hong Kong and China to handle manufacture, and are working with a Hong Kong based logistics to handle
distribution to local fulfilment centres in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.
Another product development step will be to establish Sensible Object as a world-first in hardware/digital gaming startups
that has a complete supply chain relationship e.g. from prototype to manufacture. The ambition is to explore how
to license elements of this process, or offering services based on access to this supply chain as core part of Sensible
Object.
The core of this collaboration has been the new and emerging enquiry, across creative design, manufacture, and
gaming, into how the physical and digital interact in the contemporary world. This is a key research area for the arts
and humanities, and a key place for exciting future interdisciplinary activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc6a42e00464.56448323</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Fabulous Beasts</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/play/fabulous-beasts</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exploring new futures for community documentary Much has been made of the use of immersive cinema for entertainment and spectacle, but what about using it for community documentary? This collaboration between Cardiff video company On Par Productions, cultural media expert Dr Kerry Moore and the Urban Reaction Research Lab looked at how to use projection domes to house an immersive, communicative experience.

Starting with a desire to tell the story of the immigrant population in the Butetown area of Cardiff, the project drew on cultural theory and media sociology to develop techniques for producing immersive cinema as well as exploring the users interaction with this content. The team examined the practicalities of using domes and 360&amp;deg; cinema as a long term solution for showing work.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B66F7721-EE07-459D-82B8-544F452FAFBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On Par, a documentary company from Wales founded by recent graduates in Documentary Film,

A collaboration between Julian Sykes of Hoffi (Cardiff) and Jacqui Mulville of History, Archaeology and Religion, Cardiff University.

This exploration considered how to make a new experience for heritage visitors that allows them to touch, explore and create stories around the objects they meet. The long term goal will be to scan and 3D print an object and then embed the technology that allows for recognition and connection. This will be used to engage with audiences and allow a passive experience of a heritage space to become one of true collaboration and interactivity.

It is a digital tool that extracts the main colours from an image and display them proportionally. The resulting colour charts are arranged chronologically to form a unique narrative using colour.

Colourstory is the brainchild of British artist Arthur Buxton, a free platform that lets the public create and share
beautiful representations of your life with colour using any set of images. Drawing on Buxton's artistic practice of
making stunning prints derived from dominant coloursets in visual collections, the company engages the everyday
creativity of users with the colours around them. Buxton has created a tool that analyses and then extracts the most
prominent colours from images, paintings and photographs, and gathers together the most prominent colours in
beautiful infographics. He has produced a number of prints to date, ranging from visualisations of dominant colours in
the paintings of master artists, through to Paris Vogue covers across the Twentieth century. Before REACT, Buxton
already had the idea, he had built his own primitive version of the software and had held two one man shows in tiny
local galleries. The partnership has now formed a company to launch the platform online and as an app, he has been
through a kickstarter campaign, gained start up investment, benefitted from the support of the REACT Alumni
programme and is now selling a range of products from the website.
This journey began in 2012 with Buxton teaming up with Dr Paul Laidler, a Research Fellow working in the field of fine
art digital print at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) within the University of the West of England, Bristol. As a
researcher Dr Laidler's activities cover a broad spectrum of interests relating to the discipline of printmaking and the
realisation of physical artefacts in the digital age. Dr Laidler had already launched a fine art print publishing practice
entitled CFPR Editions as a practice led approach for exploring the evolving nature and value of the digitally mediated
artefact.
The inspiration for the project was to extend Buxton's artistic practice to a wider audience by transforming the process
he has developed into an interactive, easy to use, fun, educational participatory activity. For Laidler this offered a
practice based way to investigate his research interests. They wanted to know how users of visual sharing tools like
Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest might respond to a chance to create new forms of craft from their image collections.
Colourstory enables those without design skills to interpret their everyday experiences through colour, with the option
of creating personalised printed artefacts that express their interests and tastes.
REACT's network was a key feature of the Colourstory success story. Laidler and Buxton were familiar to each other
through UWE's CFPR and heard of the REACT initiative through the University. After initial audience testing with
REACT's feasability funding they were introduced to two local entrepreneurs by REACT producers: Mike Jackson
invested in the project through Webstart and Pervasive Media Studio based entrepreneur Seth Jackson helped Buxton
form a company and joined the board. They then found their development talent by approaching a team based at the
Bristol Games Hub which grew out the Pervasive Media Studio three years ago. Working through the Alumni Scheme,
Colourstory is now constituted as a company with a business plan selling the app and its products to consumers: it is
actively seeking first round investment funding to expand the reach of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc66361be292.34400390</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Colourstory</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/feasibility-alumni/colourstory</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Around the world the numbers of people with stress and anxiety is increasing, yet the number of non-medical options to support their needs is significantly small.

THE REACT SANDBOX
Our primary mechanism for enacting these values has been the REACT Sandbox, adapted from Watershed's existing
Sandbox methodology and delivered by a team of Watershed Creative Producers, dedicated to REACT projects. We
have run five Sandboxes each with their own theme. These have explored Heritage, Books and Print, Future
Documentary, Internet-connect Objects and Play. Each of these themes was generated in consultation with creative
economy advisors. They appeal to those sectors most in need of research and development to respond to the
disruptions of technological innovation.
The starting point of the Sandbox is an Ideas Labs, an event where potential applicants from academia and creative
industry meet to develop ideas. Across the programme, we have hosted 12 Ideas Labs across Cardiff, Exeter and
Bristol, attracting 672 attendees.
After Ideas Labs, collaborative teams are supported by REACT Producers to develop bids. Teams apply through a
light-touch application form that asks them to propose their activity and ideas, and provide a budget. Projects are
selected for interview by a mixed panel of industry and academic advisors. Final projects are selected for a Sandbox
on the basis of the quality of the relationship in the partnership. The are five broad criteria for selection:
? What's the quality of the idea? Does it feel relevant and exciting and new?
? does the bid have potential to be a mutual collaboration?
? does the project have potential for post-award development?
? do the partners understand where their users might be and how they can reach them?
? how will the partners in the project fit into the cohort as a whole?

A cohort of between six and eight projects is chosen that represents a diverse range of skills, approaches and
knowledges. Some projects may be relatively straightforward, while others more risky. Curating a 'slate' of projects is
a core component of the method, where innovation is stimulated through a mixture of project types, ambitions and
talents.
The Sandbox production period runs for three to four months during which time every project is required to produce a
working prototype that can be tested with audiences. Successful project teams are awarded up to &amp;pound;50k per project to
carry out this work. &amp;pound;10k goes towards the company's investment in the project (most often their time) and the
remaining &amp;pound;40k spent on academic time, HEI costs, travel, materials and other project resources such as prototyping,
manufacture and testing, or subcontracting additional expertise.
During the Sandbox period, teams are required to meet for day long sessions at least once a month, to share progress
and get specialist appropriate input from their relevant sector or market organisations. The whole process is coordinated
by a Creative Producer with a supporting team of industry advisors, a specialist business mentor, PR and
legal coaching. Projects are also supported in applying to next stage funding and investment by the producer team.
Each project participates in a public showcase within two months of the end of the programme and each project gets
its own five minute film as a promotional tool.
The Sandbox is distinct from other KE or business development processes partly because of its insistence on cohort
based learning and the necessary generosity that underpins it and partly by its use of iteration with audiences and
users to allow projects to change and develop. The net effect is of a process that fosters the kind of hyper-connectivity
between people, disciplines and technologies that creates a great deal 'more then the sum of its parts'. Modelled on
principles of Open Innovation, it also places care for its participants, and generosity of ideas and skills as central to its
operation.

THE PRACTICE OF CULTURAL ECOLOGY
Our main achievement has been developing a system that builds 'bridge capital' between different sectors for the co- creation of value in the creative economy. We recognised at the outset of the hub that our main challenge was to break down the real and perceived barriers between universities and creative businesses. This mission is vertical as well as horizontal, in that barriers exist within individual HEIs, between different HEIs, as well as between HEIs and creative businesses, and in between and inside businesses themselves. These 'silos' are frequently an impediment to innovation in fast moving creative economy that depends on interdisciplinary co-operation.
REACT has facilitated new and innovative interactions by building a network that is, at its heart, a new kind of collaborative domain. Our collaborations are based on participants exchanging all kinds of value with one another, much of which is common to the development of successful businesses and academic practices: skills, knowledge, approach, support, inspiration, respect.
This 'space' is neither industry nor university but an intermediate zone designed with and maintained by Watershed in the form of the Pervasive Media Studio. Here people and businesses can meet outside of their usual structures and pressures, immersing themselves in a creative process that changes them, creates new products, new services, new businesses, jobs and, most important of all, builds new kinds of connectivity. This is the practice of cultural ecology.
The REACT network, like an ecosystem, has its own emergent properties. This system is designed to particularly serve the needs of microbusinesses and SMEs who constitute the overwhelming mass of the Creative Economy (see section 3). Isolated, they are often vulnerable to a changeable marketplace and a reliance on client work, while connected they develop resilience and sustainability through connection with peers and development of ideas. By bringing together diverse talents and disciplines working on projects that have an inbuilt need to grow and develop the innovation process is set in motion but not controlled.
REACT allowed projects to jointly explore themes and offer support that is right for their practice, where this was to create commercial products, scale their creative or business activity, or encourage exploration of their own practice. Taken together our projects make a statement about the future of practices that exist at the boundary between creative practice and digital technologies, and built up the confidence for other creative talents to explore new technologies within this framework. REACT takes an editorial role in this narrative, broadly influencing the development of these new creative processes, and addresses new themes and with an emphasis on academic collaboration, working with our partners to mobilise world-leading research and creative talent.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the West of England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>REACT Creative Economy Hub (AHRC J005185/1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEF17D95-B946-4F93-9378-B9D8F68AB9DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Please see Key Findings and Narrative Impacts for full reports.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d42a057de0b5.89967142-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The REACT Hub's organisation is comparatively straightforward consisting in the delivery team, the Operations Group and the Steering Board; we have also convened an Advisory Group around particular issues or themes.

THE REACT SANDBOX
Our primary mechanism for enacting these values has been the REACT Sandbox, adapted from Watershed's existing
Sandbox methodology and delivered by a team of Watershed Creative Producers, dedicated to REACT projects. We
have run five Sandboxes each with their own theme. These have explored Heritage, Books and Print, Future
Documentary, Internet-connect Objects and Play. Each of these themes was generated in consultation with creative
economy advisors. They appeal to those sectors most in need of research and development to respond to the
disruptions of technological innovation.
The starting point of the Sandbox is an Ideas Labs, an event where potential applicants from academia and creative
industry meet to develop ideas. Across the programme, we have hosted 12 Ideas Labs across Cardiff, Exeter and
Bristol, attracting 672 attendees.
After Ideas Labs, collaborative teams are supported by REACT Producers to develop bids. Teams apply through a
light-touch application form that asks them to propose their activity and ideas, and provide a budget. Projects are
selected for interview by a mixed panel of industry and academic advisors. Final projects are selected for a Sandbox
on the basis of the quality of the relationship in the partnership. The are five broad criteria for selection:
? What's the quality of the idea? Does it feel relevant and exciting and new?
? does the bid have potential to be a mutual collaboration?
? does the project have potential for post-award development?
? do the partners understand where their users might be and how they can reach them?
? how will the partners in the project fit into the cohort as a whole?

A cohort of between six and eight projects is chosen that represents a diverse range of skills, approaches and
knowledges. Some projects may be relatively straightforward, while others more risky. Curating a 'slate' of projects is
a core component of the method, where innovation is stimulated through a mixture of project types, ambitions and
talents.
The Sandbox production period runs for three to four months during which time every project is required to produce a
working prototype that can be tested with audiences. Successful project teams are awarded up to &amp;pound;50k per project to
carry out this work. &amp;pound;10k goes towards the company's investment in the project (most often their time) and the
remaining &amp;pound;40k spent on academic time, HEI costs, travel, materials and other project resources such as prototyping,
manufacture and testing, or subcontracting additional expertise.
During the Sandbox period, teams are required to meet for day long sessions at least once a month, to share progress
and get specialist appropriate input from their relevant sector or market organisations. The whole process is coordinated
by a Creative Producer with a supporting team of industry advisors, a specialist business mentor, PR and
legal coaching. Projects are also supported in applying to next stage funding and investment by the producer team.
Each project participates in a public showcase within two months of the end of the programme and each project gets
its own five minute film as a promotional tool.
The Sandbox is distinct from other KE or business development processes partly because of its insistence on cohort
based learning and the necessary generosity that underpins it and partly by its use of iteration with audiences and
users to allow projects to change and develop. The net effect is of a process that fosters the kind of hyper-connectivity
between people, disciplines and technologies that creates a great deal 'more then the sum of its parts'. Modelled on
principles of Open Innovation, it also places care for its participants, and generosity of ideas and skills as central to its
operation.

THE PRACTICE OF CULTURAL ECOLOGY
Our main achievement has been developing a system that builds 'bridge capital' between different sectors for the co- creation of value in the creative economy. We recognised at the outset of the hub that our main challenge was to break down the real and perceived barriers between universities and creative businesses. This mission is vertical as well as horizontal, in that barriers exist within individual HEIs, between different HEIs, as well as between HEIs and creative businesses, and in between and inside businesses themselves. These 'silos' are frequently an impediment to innovation in fast moving creative economy that depends on interdisciplinary co-operation.
REACT has facilitated new and innovative interactions by building a network that is, at its heart, a new kind of collaborative domain. Our collaborations are based on participants exchanging all kinds of value with one another, much of which is common to the development of successful businesses and academic practices: skills, knowledge, approach, support, inspiration, respect.
This 'space' is neither industry nor university but an intermediate zone designed with and maintained by Watershed in the form of the Pervasive Media Studio. Here people and businesses can meet outside of their usual structures and pressures, immersing themselves in a creative process that changes them, creates new products, new services, new businesses, jobs and, most important of all, builds new kinds of connectivity. This is the practice of cultural ecology.
The REACT network, like an ecosystem, has its own emergent properties. This system is designed to particularly serve the needs of microbusinesses and SMEs who constitute the overwhelming mass of the Creative Economy (see section 3). Isolated, they are often vulnerable to a changeable marketplace and a reliance on client work, while connected they develop resilience and sustainability through connection with peers and development of ideas. By bringing together diverse talents and disciplines working on projects that have an inbuilt need to grow and develop the innovation process is set in motion but not controlled.
REACT allowed projects to jointly explore themes and offer support that is right for their practice, where this was to create commercial products, scale their creative or business activity, or encourage exploration of their own practice. Taken together our projects make a statement about the future of practices that exist at the boundary between creative practice and digital technologies, and built up the confidence for other creative talents to explore new technologies within this framework. REACT takes an editorial role in this narrative, broadly influencing the development of these new creative processes, and addresses new themes and with an emphasis on academic collaboration, working with our partners to mobilise world-leading research and creative talent.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Watershed Media Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>REACT Creative Economy Hub (AHRC J005185/1)</gtr:description><gtr:id>169EF8E3-41DC-4EA4-BCCD-D81E133F7B60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Please see Key Findings and Narrative Impacts for full reports.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d42a057de0b5.89967142-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The REACT Hub's organisation is comparatively straightforward consisting in the delivery team, the Operations Group and the Steering Board; we have also convened an Advisory Group around particular issues or themes.

REACT takes an editorial role in this narrative, broadly influencing the development of these new creative processes, and addresses new themes and with an emphasis on academic collaboration, working with our partners to mobilise world-leading research and creative talent.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Political/community engagement at The Senedd, home of the National Assembly of Wales, Cardiff</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CB7535C-2978-42A5-839B-9372181F337E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was organised by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), led by Andy Green, a Wales-based academic and consultant, who is leading a project funded by the RSA on new definitions and ideas for social capital.

The festival, hosted at Bridewell Island in central Bristol, bought together the creative networks from the South West to make this happen. It engaged with Creative Youth Network, an organisation supporting young people in Bristol, artist studio and infrastructure providers The Island, venue caf&amp;eacute; The Kitchen and a private airsoft business in The Old Magistrate's Courts for the first time. The production and organisation brought together staff from around the region; Watershed, National Theatre Wales, Wildworks, The Invisible Circus, The Island, The Station and Shangri-la (Glastonbury) all providing team members to ensure that the best quality experience could be realised for our visitors.
The teams collaborated to create an immersive, expansive audience experience that showcased the breadth and depth of collaboration, of academic research and of technological innovation. Across the space we created 23 installations that ranged from a bedroom where you could explore the future of sex and intimacy, to a library that considered how books and print could be reimagined for the future. 
The event attracted over 6,000 people across the weekend. At times there were queues stretching around the block. It demonstrated a strong demand for more experiences that explored the intersection between creative technology, experience and research - from death to future books, social activism to sex toys, giant sculptures, bio-activated mazes, and interactive light swings. 
Core to our aims of exploring and connecting thought leadership in new themes, we delivered a one-day conference exploring the role of creative microbusiness in the creative sector, and the role of HEIs in collaborating with the sector. This featured engagements from academia and business, including representatives from the other hubs. We ran a programme of workshops for members of the public including intimacy labs for couples, den building for children and adults, and toy hacking.
REACT successfully secured a &amp;pound;50k grant from the Arts Council England for The Rooms, to match its own substantial investment to produce the festival.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c85a2d8ccc30.11090120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/projects/rooms</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cardiff, Creative Capital: sector-wide conference aimed at creative economy participants and their local authority counterparts</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EBA545F6-9434-4EB4-9C93-DB25824A896D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cardiff, Creative Capital was a major event, hosted at Cardiff University, with the support of the British Council.

Its initiation was closely informed by the experience of two AHRC-funded projects: Media, Community and the Creative Citizen and REACT. By connecting and, consequentially, intensify and amplifying the interactions between creatives in areas as different as film-making and design or video-effects and fashion, we aimed to enable our regional business and cultural organisations to tap into Cardiff University's developing innovation system. Funding for this work came from Cardiff University, supported by BBC Wales, the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff City Council and Arts Council Wales. The breadth of this coalition enabled us to connect creative practitioners with completely new communities of shared interest and, at the time of writing, to commence a more ambitious second phase of partnership intended to establish a consortium connecting creative practitioners and local authorities, as Cardiff moves towards a &amp;pound;1.3bn City Deal expansion. We seek partnership with any organisation which shares our goals. By February 2016, Creative Cardiff had over 900 registered members and a Twitter following of almost 8,000. We have organised numerous events, including Cardiff Creative Capital, Mapping Cardiff's Creative Economy, in December 2015. This event brought together representatives from local authorities across the UK and pivotal dialogue between creative economy practitioners from other universities, such as Sheffield. At the event, Creative Cardiff's detailed map of its regional creative economy was presented.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a5de318981a3.80072934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.creativecardiff.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>158963</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Creative Economy Follow On funding to colleague in UWE ( Proffessor Steve Poole) attributable to the REACT project.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/P013333/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>88F759FF-0413-4E8F-8E95-93EB99B74773</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94bfd91e4a0.74030466</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Exeter University Arts Faculty</gtr:department><gtr:description>Exeter University Arts Faculty ( this is funding attributable to the REACT consortium but not managed by myself as PI)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Exeter</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>23DB566D-F890-4AB9-8A89-69D080E3C635</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c946ffa42bb3.89779739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>161238</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Follow On for Creative Economy</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/P013163/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>DC44DF86-7B98-47D6-834B-9B791CB75479</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94af41cd259.71424985</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Bristol QR ( Funding not received by me but by REACT partner attributed to REACT research project)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Bristol</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>90F7FC76-7BD5-49DE-951D-569F3D719BD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c948344f2686.57004347</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1500000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Cardiff University QR ( not my funding but attributed to the success of REACT)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Cardiff University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C5313F5F-E795-483C-B6B0-3403E5DBD502</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9478ca1a7e2.51275454</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Over 80% of the 57 companies funded by REACT as core partners are microbusinesses, with 42 employing 10 or fewer members of staff, and only one employing more than 100. 53 Of these businesses private sector. REACT has worked with public sector organisations such as Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter or Arnos Vale Cemetery Trust as partners, and end-users for products.
We have worked with businesses across the country, but our focus has by far been on the South West of England and South Wales, with over 75% of our funded companies coming from the region. This has demonstrated the burgeoning creative potential of our region.
Because of the specific and varied needs of this diverse cohort, the impacts of taking part in a REACT project are felt differently by different companies, according to their size, the length of time they have been running, and the extent to which the ideas they develop. What follows illustrates the different forms of impact we have realised, relative to the sector's needs and expectations.
Impact on funded projects
? Stimulated work: REACT has directly secured work for 57 project partners and over 35 subcontractors between 2012 and 2016. Just over &amp;pound;590k was awarded directly to partner companies as part of the &amp;pound;2.5 million awarded by REACT to collaborations. This allowed companies to buy time out from their core business activities for R&amp;amp;D.
o REACT microbusiness partners' usual business activity frequently focuses on client work, and rarely have the capacity of larger firms to explore R&amp;amp;D. Investment of the kind offered by REACT provided these companies with an opportunity to explore new markets, develop ideas for products and services, and establish themselves with confidence in their sector, without the pressures of client work.
? Increased activity: over 1747 days of company activity committed to funded activities. Internal investment from 18 companies saw them offer an additional 524 days in-kind to projects worth an estimated &amp;pound;140k. We also estimate that REACT collaborations have continued to invest over 1,000 days in developing their products after our funding ended. Much of this work has been made possible by further investment from non-REACT sources, income from sales, or internal investment (see below).
? Generated investment: we have documented &amp;pound;2.86million received in investment across 19 REACT companies, 9 of which have received over &amp;pound;50k. This investment includes a mixture of public and private project commissions (Nth Screen), Venture and Angel investment (Reach Robotics, Sensible Object), industry awards (Chaka Studios, Rubber Republic), product sales (Colourstory, Mayfly), innovation funding (Enabling Play), and third or public sector commissions (Calvium, Splash and Ripple). Indicative example:
o Reach Robotics (Prototype Fund, Play Sandbox) has on its own received approximately &amp;pound;1.1 million in further investment - see case study. This funding is essential to go into the production and development of a robotics product, which falls more in line with traditional startup models for development.
? Job growth: 10 commercial companies have been formed to either take part in REACT activities or pursue new products and services developed during REACT funded. This has led directly to the creation of 30 new jobs. These have had impacts appropriate to the size and nature of the company. Indicative examples:
o Splash and Ripple (Heritage Sandbox, Alumni), originally a freelance business formed a startup company limited by guarantee in 2012. They now employ staff employ at 1.5fte, and received &amp;pound;100k from post-REACT commissions in 2013. Their turnover in 2015/2016 is now &amp;pound;70,000.
6
o Sensible Object (Play Sandbox) formed in 2014 employ 6fte staff, having received support from REACT to develop a product prototype and further private investment, and have en estimated 2015/2016 turnover of &amp;pound;250k.
? 262 new distinctive assets for companies to develop and exploit (see section 6 for detail). These have enabled businesses to either produce entirely new products or services. Indicative example:
o Enabling Play (Play Sandbox) created an app to assist children, particularly those with Down's Syndrome, learn about the mathematical premise of magnitude. Received &amp;pound;80k from Nominet Trust in 2015 to develop the app further and launched the product, and are developing further games.
? New skills and expertise to offer the market: companies credit REACT process, exposure to the REACT network, business support, and talent development as being instrumental in further developments in their company, even if not directly exploiting prototypes made during REACT funding. This has been part of growth in the creative economy sector. Total turnover for all companies in the REACT network has increased an estimated &amp;pound;2million or 4% growth. Indicative example:
o Aerian Studios (Prototype, Alumni) are an established design and UX company, whose involvement in REACT has enabled them to experiment with new forms of touch-activated technology and products. They credit the expertise developed working on REACT projects with generating at least &amp;pound;350k in further work for their business.
? New company processes that help companies find better ways to operate parts of their business. This has been distinctly felt by larger companies: Indicative example:
o
Kinneir Dufort (Objects Sandbox), who are an award winning design agency employing around 60 people state:
'The REACT Objects Sandbox project provided us with an opportunity to prototype new ways of working on technology projects, which we deployed directly on a subsequent commercial project for the Huggies brand in Korea. The result, a wearable camera for Mums and babies, designed and prototyped within 4 months, was viewed by two and a half million people in a campaign with Huggies consumers in Korea at the end of 2014.' (Kinneir Dufort)
? Industry awards, enabling companies to gain traction and recognition in their chosen industry or form. Indicative examples:
o The Quipu Project (Future Documentary Sandbox) generated an interactive phoneline, online archive and web portal to capture and share the story of the thousands of men and women forcibly sterilised in Peru in the 1990s. The project won awards from Tribeca film Festival's New Media Award (worth $50k USD) and Hot Docs Festival in Canada.
o Fabulous Beasts (Play Sandbox) won Best Augmented Reality game at Indiecade, a leading independent games festival in New York.
o Orion (Future Documentary Sandbox) documentary won The Discovery award at the British Independent Film Awards and has been screened at Sundance Film Festival.
? Talent Development: given the large number of microbusinesses in our funded cohort, talent development has been a core impact of REACT. We have seen success in boosting the professional confidence and thus opportunities to many individual creative practitioners in REACT, opening doors to new projects and investment. Please see section 7 for more detail about this impact.

Sectoral impact
&amp;quot;It is no exaggeration to say that in five months the Sandbox has delivered as much as some mainstream publishers have done in five years.&amp;quot; George Walkley, Head of Digital at Hachette
Our themed approach to R&amp;amp;D, supported with consultation with the creative sector (see section 4) has established REACT and its projects as key voices in conversations around topics such as the future of heritage, human experience in the Internet of Things, the future of book and print and new approaches to Interactive Documentary.
 We have taken part in activities central to the industry as a whole, including panels at SXSW Digital in Austin, Texas in
 2013 and 2015, showcase and workshops with the children's media sector at Children's Media Conference in
 Sheffield, pushing the form of Interactive Documentary at Sheffield Doc Fest and beyond. We have written industry
 advice on support innovation in the publishing sector.
7
We have received media coverage in over 150 articles across industry and popular press including Wired, The Guardian, Times Higher Education supplement, Techspark, the Bookseller, Huffington Post, and New Statesman. These have reached an estimated audience of 159,090,953, with a total Advertising Value Equivalent of &amp;pound;703,173. These figures provide a good guide to the total potential audience REACT would have reached as well as the value of the coverage achieved in advertising terms across the four years. See Appendix 3 for more information on our reach and press coverage, as well as some press clippings.
Impact on CE infrastructure
Our engagements with the CE (see section 4a for details) have facilitated the generation of a network of over 800 creatives and academics. The impact has been improved capacity for collaborative R&amp;amp;D and a strong network of individuals and groups not previously linked. New capacity has been built by Universities to support the creative economy and its interaction with academic research. For more detailed information on the impact upon partner HEIs please see sections 5b and 8.

REACT's stated ambition at the beginning of the project was to generate a long-lasting network of activity, including a number of on-going relationships between HEIs and the Creative Economy. At least half of our projects have on-going relationships that will yield new impacts related to this on-going activity. However, the timescales that are necessary for impact to be realised (products launched, investment generated, brands established and grown) means that the impacts we are seeing now are still early. Our most recently completed projects (Play Sandbox and Alumni Scheme) will see a large amount of activity in the immediate post-REACT period. Indicative examples include, but are not limited to:
- MechaMonsters (Prototype, Alumni) hoping to launch product in Autumn 2016 leading to commercial impact
- Colourstory (Feasibility, Alumni) business continue to develop, seeking investment. Product already available.
Commercial and academic impacts.
- Fabulous Beasts (Play Sandbox) have successfully run a Kickstarter raising over &amp;pound;150,000 for the first
commercial release their stacking game (already received &amp;pound;250k in angel and VC investment). Commercial
impacts.
- Mayfly (Feasibility, Alumni Scheme) are already selling products (see case study in section 14) commercial
and cultural impacts, research impacts.
- Tact.to (Prototype Funding, Alumni Scheme): Aerian continuing to develop interactive heritage display case,
already generating further business from project and impact on University of Bristol Theatre Collection to
rethink how their role and processes in display and archiving
- Volume of Circumstance (Books and Print, Alumni) in discussions with Penguin to finance the research and
launch 4 new interactive reading experience products.
- Quipu (Future Documentary, Alumni) have launched interactive website to share testimonials of women and
men forcibly sterilised in Peru in the 1990s. Part of a broader advocacy community seeking justice in Peru,
actively promoted for Peruvian elections in 2016.
- Ghosts in the Garden (Heritage, Alumni Scheme): ongoing partnership, already creating experiences for
commercial commissions. Continued involvement of historian as Associate Historian and the Adventure
Heritage Manifesto. Ongoing impact through new work, new commissions and dissemination activities.
- Beginning of Ambient Literature research programme (UWE, Bristol, Bath Spa &amp;amp; Birmingham) featuring both academic and creative alumni from REACT producing new academic and creative work. Impact in
commission of new work, new research and public showcasing.
This is only a broad snapshot of activity. We have secured Faculty investment from UWE to support a Research Fellow for 2 years after REACT, whose role will in part be to continue the documentation of impacts generated by REACT post-February. Additionally, &amp;pound;1.5million has been invested by Cardiff University to launch its own creative economy programme, including the establishment with partners of a Creative Cardiff network, and Kaleider, a studio in Exeter, are collaborating with University of Exeter and Met Office to produce a similar hub in the SW.

NEW METHODOLOGIES FOR KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE
 We facilitate
innovative interaction by insisting that the collaboration is led by and grounded in the practice of production. Having
forged these collaborations we have facilitated their interaction by managing a methodology with five key
characteristics
1. Previously formed identities of the partners are supported in changing as they are called upon to work in
new ways. One measure of success is that when our teams present projects at the end of the process
audiences ask 'who was the academic and who was the business partner?' Knowledge is not 'transferred'
but the partners jointly explore their topic bringing different approaches, skills and dispositions to the task.
2. The collaborative space is held so that people can take risks. The role of the Watershed in maintaining the
third space of collaboration is key to this aspect of the REACT. The producers encourage and support
participants to have new kinds of ideas, to move out of their comfort zones, to imagine the unlikely or
downright impossible in order to jump start a process. The creative collaborative space is generous,
encourages sharing and is safe.
3. Recognition that the collaboration is a journey likely to go awry, become confused and iterate several
versions of the outcome before settling in the final design phase. The Sandbox method has a tight timeline
with its own arc that although challenging for first-time participants, is conducted by producers who
support partners through their crises and ensure that by the end there is always something to show. This
shows that innovation is both the journey of an idea and of people: caring for both is vital.
4. Talent development: creativity and innovation do not reside in a job description or a professional identity.
Creativity can come from many directions. We have been able to mobilise a wide origin of our academic participants, from 25 disciplines in Arts &amp;amp; Humantities, however it is clear that successful
collaborations depend not on disciplinary depth or research ranking but on the ability of both sides of the
partnership to be open, imaginative, and generous.
The kinds of value exchanges that constitute this zone of collaboration then extend out to a whole new network of
university and creative sector collaboration across the region. REACT has built new bridges between the five
universities and Watershed, new bridges between creative businesses themselves, as well with Universities and new
connections between individual creatives and researchers. The Steering Board and the Operations group are particularly symbolic of this bridge building process; teams that were at first tentative and more than a little
suspicious have become new sites for new collaborations and future initiatives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>? The REACT collaboration demonstrates how different kinds of Universities, cultural partners and creative
businesses can together co-create an effective regional intervention. It has articulated cultural ecology as
a practice.
? REACT demonstrates how Universities can successfully engage with creative economy micro businesses
by co designing networks that aggregate their impact and value.
? REACT's success argues for the importance of working with 'third space' partners who are neither
University nor Industry, creating an environment for risk and innovation.
? The genuinely cross disciplinary success of REACT demonstrates the potential for 'STEAM' led cross
research council support for creative economy impact.
? The commercial and social enterprise mobilised by REACT demonstrates the need for research council
investment to be matched with innovation investment to support impact and implementation.
? The success of The Rooms demonstrates that there is a public appetite for understanding creative
innovation.

In order for this kind of work to be carried out, and these successes realised, there are number of
challenges facing the sector that need to be met:

? It is challenging for HEI systems to deal with the smaller businesses that constitute the bulk of the
Creative Economy sector. We have been challenged by University contracting processes which are
frequently very slow moving and we have been challenged by HEI partners payments systems which are
too slow for business partners. Our delivery team became progress chasers and we worked with all of our
University partners to recruit the relevant teams to the mission. This however is only a short-term solution.
We recommend a standard simple, plain English template for all contracts with external creative business
partners.
? The dynamism, instability and vulnerability of the creative micro business world make it a challenging
space for Universities; success and stability are hard-won and long term processes. Hub impacts are
likely to build through continuing long term relationships rather than through the short term 'acceleration'
models.
? We have been challenged by the University default assumptions on holding IP in co created projects. We
believe IP should be kept at the margins at the start of a creative innovation process. IP negotiations
before IP exists are a destructive waste of time. Our contracts make new foreground IP the property of the
company with the potential for a revision of the share down the line. We have received feedback from
businesses that this is an important principle. We recommend minimising the barriers to IP exploitation
and ensuring that money stays at the margins of the creative and collaborative process.
? The accounting systems in place to support research activity are not 'impact positive'. We have been
challenged by the opacity of FEC, subsidy and the contracting of academic research time to external
partners. Transparency on where money goes and how it is spent by all partners is key to building trust in
collaborations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>06E24C08-BF48-43C3-8864-86B75A07CD19</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc3f4b3912b1.38432572</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.react-hub.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to BIS Oct 2013</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2B27BB6-B7B5-4147-9340-0087305F4653</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94e9cdb4a94.09759558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to Hera/Norface - EU &amp;amp; N.American University Research Managers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC6E138F-6994-4975-9864-F047A65092E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94f626cdf85.81051890</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Dowling Review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8C9AF15-6A67-4487-A128-39947E6C3EB2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94dcd74aaf3.23369785</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation of Findings to European Commission, European Observator and Lisbon Council (Hub-relevant insights/work form aspect of a multi-strand relationship which also includes IP/innovation)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AA589A4-1ABB-4154-8DB5-952E5B067DF4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94ff52e40e3.33401150</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to RCUK on Creative Economy Universities and Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3161E22-D3C3-479B-9327-F9593C75CB00</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94ef1909eb3.03511898</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is a method for creating innovative prototypes for the Creative Economy in an intensive three month programme.
