The study objective is to understand why some children and adolescents of depressed mothers show better than expected developmental outcomes, while others develop serious and enduring psychological problems such as depression or antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project makes use of two complementary datasets - a population cohort of parents and children recruited in pregnancy (ALSPAC, N=14,541), and a sample of parents with recurrent clinical depression (EPAD, N=337). Both studies have followed parents and their children as they grow older. This means that analyses can begin to disentangle underlying causal processes&amp;nbsp; by testing how change in young people's mental health is related to change in factors thought to promote resilience (and vice versa). Multiple spheres of influence on adolescent development will be considered, including family, child and peer factors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will examine long-term protective effects, as well as change in well-being such as recovery from earlier emotional or behavioural problems. The study also aims to identify ?risk buffers? especially important in the context of maternal depression, and it will examine whether processes explaining resilience differ for boys and girls. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One in ten young people suffer from significant emotional and behavioural disorders, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in teenagers and young adults. Moreover, evidence highlights that such problems have become more common in recent years. Youth depression and antisocial behaviour show strong continuities with adult psychosocial adjustment, and have broad consequences for young people's life chances, including education, work and family life. It is therefore a key social, economic and health priority to develop policies and practical interventions that reduce the incidence and burden of adolescent psychopathology. Epidemiological and clinical studies show that adolescents of depressed mothers are at an especially high risk of depression, conduct disorder, substance use, self harm and suicide. However, problematic outcomes are not inevitable for these young people as there is considerable variation in functional adaptation within this high risk group. It is striking that many adolescents appear remarkably resilient even when their mother suffers from chronic and severe depression. Having identified maternal depression as an important risk factor we now need to move forward by establishing what psychosocial factors promote adaptive adolescent developmental trajectories. Crucially, developmental processes and mechanisms that explain resilience remain poorly understood. The identification of modifiable protective mechanisms of relevance to this at-risk group will inform local and national policy and appropriate targets for preventative interventions. However, it is first necessary to be sure that identified protective factors result in sustained positive developmental trajectories, to better understand the causal mechanisms involved, and to ensure that findings are robust across different samples and population subgroups.

Specific beneficiaries of our research will include intervention experts and policy makers. We will work closely with those designing intervention programmes for young people living with mothers who are depressed. They will benefit by being informed of appropriate targets for new preventive strategies aimed at enhancing resilience. Policy-makers will also benefit directly from this research. Much research appropriately highlights the risks for offspring of depressed parents. Understanding promoters of resilience will provide a useful complement in making decisions about putting in place efforts to support these high risk adolescents, both locally and nationally. We will continue our work with the Dartington Social Research Unit (DSRU). For example, the PI is currently involved in work by the DSRU who are partnering several local authorities to test out innovative approaches to use evidence to shape children's services. We aim to use similar strategies to translate understanding of specific targets for promoting adolescent resilience based on a strong empirical and replicated evidence base into effective future policy and practice. This in turn makes it more likely that the research will have longer term benefits for young people affected by parental depression through improved access to effective interventions and services. This has the potential to benefit young people's immediate and long-term psychosocial functioning. Promoting resilient psychosocial trajectories in adolescents will have positive consequences for society as a whole by reducing the burden of economic and social costs associated with depression and antisocial behaviour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>213892</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>NIHR Developing and evaluating an online psychoeducation package for adolescent depression</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A56CC19-CCB3-43A3-8EA5-88FBF80AD389</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461dee4ad9709.21831215-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Development of evidence-based psychoeducation package for young people with or at high-risk of depression.

The package is currently being evaluated. 

A briefing on key research findings has been disseminated widely - to intervention experts in the UK and internationally, to policy makers (e.g. Children's commissioner for Wales), to voluntary organisations that provide help and information to young people with mental health problems, and to health professionals and related professional bodies and organisations (e.g. NICE). We have given an extensive range of talks to practitioners and policy makers. We plan to continue raising awareness of the main findings from the project, and are involved in ongoing discussions with policy makers and intervention/prevention experts to maximise impact from the project in future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>915C4407-D31B-443C-8712-F3BAD5A6F74B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>559fa794dd4b78.22105269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In the UK at least 1 million children have a mother with serious depression. Maternal depression is a common risk factor for adolescent depression and antisocial behaviour. These problems are important to prevent given their substantial individual, social and economic impact. Some adolescents fare better than expected. Understanding resilience mechanisms is important for designing effective preventative interventions. Our objective was to identify modifiable child, family and social protective factors that contribute to resilience in two complementary datasets (a high risk sample of mothers with recurrent depression and a population birth cohort).
We were successful in achieving our aims. Key findings are as follows. 1) Resilience is not uncommon; around one in five in the high risk sample showed sustained good mental health. In both studies many young people had better than expected mental health given severity of their mother's depression. 2) Child self esteem, efficacy and exercise, parental warmth and support (including from fathers), and good quality social relationships are all important. 3) Multiple protective factors together contribute to resilience (high risk study: 0/1 protective factors: 0-5% resilient; 2/3 protective factors: 10-13%; 4/5 protective factors: 38-48% resilient). 4) In the population cohort protective factors assessed earlier in childhood (age 8-10) showed enduring protective effects that persisted to early adulthood (age 19). 5) Some predictors showed domain-specific protective effects. For example, fathers' emotional support and child physical exercise only showed protective benefits in relation to depression (not antisocial behaviour). 6) Less serious but sustained symptoms of depression in mothers (affecting 50% of the population cohort) are also associated with risks for youth mental health problems, but the same protective factors accounted for resilience in this group as in young people exposed to chronic severe maternal depression. 
These novel findings were carefully tested to rule out alternative explanations. Protective effects were not simply proxies for less severe maternal depression. We also tested the possibility of reverse causation. For example, a cross-lagged modelling approach showed that fathers' emotional support predicts a decrease in adolescent depressive symptoms, but not vice versa.
These findings have important implications. First, not all parents with depression receive treatment, and treatment is not always successful. Depression is often chronic or recurrent. Identifying protective factors that help 'buffer' children from these risks is therefore important. Second, preventative interventions at present typically focus on specific mechanisms in isolation (e.g. psychological therapies or social interventions). Our study clearly shows that multi-modal interventions that enhance protective effects across multiple domains are needed. Third, simple changes to existing interventions could have substantial benefits, e.g. promoting frequent physical exercise, involving fathers in family-based interventions, and engaging with schools to help facilitate good social relationships. 
Findings are being published in a series of journal papers. We have presented at international conferences, at meetings of health, education and social care practitioners, and to policy makers. Links with intervention scientists have helped inform the development of a new psychoeducation package for adolescents.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Existing interventions for young people affected by maternal depression should be modified and new ones developed. Their effectiveness then needs to be evaluated. We have disseminated our findings widely, established links with intervention scientists, and helped in the development of a new online psychoeducation package for adolescent depression. Findings are also relevant to practitioners working with families affected by maternal depression. Health professionals dealing with adult depression should be aware of risks for mental health problems in children, and also what factors might help prevent problems. Findings also have important public health and policy implications. Chronic severe depression affecting 1 in 20 mothers was associated with greatest risk, but half of mothers in the population cohort had less severe but sustained symptoms of depression also associated with maladaptive youth outcomes (depression, suicidality and antisocial behaviour). The same predictors accounted for resilience as in the highest-risk group. Therefore, efforts should also focus on developing effective mechanisms that deliver benefits to at-risk children beyond the clinical setting, for example via online psychoeducation. To achieve impact at local and national levels we are collaborating with the Dartington Social Research Unit, the National Centre for Mental Health, and the Welsh Assembly Government.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C80981C4-FAFE-4F99-ACD5-E13AB275C86A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>559fa7199f9f49.71264535</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure
