Sacred texts mobilise many forms of change, but while studies on them tend to focus on an exegesis of textual meanings, they rarely show how religious specialists, their clients and even the texts themselves interact in practices that trigger religious change. Shamanic or 'animistic' religions in particular have often been considered as the foil to the world religions, whose text-reading priests cite written passages which reinforce social conventions across the generations (Barth 1990). However, sacred texts can also be subjected to a 'hybridised' practice of textual and oral exegesis, which combines (1) the imagistic-linguistic (or phonetic) elements of script forms and (2) the materiality of the written texts as used in rituals with (3) religious practitioners' memories of previous performances, which often reflect a spontaneous response to the current social circumstance. The project is innovative in that it investigates the chanting of sacred texts as a 'technique' which skilfully amalgamates the materiality of the text with its imagistic scripts, in ways that either give rise to 'revelatory' religious innovations or reinforce conventions.\n\nResearch Context. This project will be the third stage of research in the Anthropology Research Group at Oxford on Eastern Medicines and Religions (ArgO-EMR). When Drs. Hsu, Ramble and Swancutt received their ESRC award in 2006, ArgO-EMR was awarded another grant from the John Fell Fund, for a project carried out by Dr. Bassini (October 2006-June 2008) on the health benefits of household rituals in Qinghai, China. We held international workshops in 2007 on 'The Sacred Landscape in Tibetan Healing' and in 2008 on 'Humoural Notions of Balance', and plan to hold another in 2010 on 'The Viewpoint of the Technique: Managing Time and Crisis Resolution in Eastern Religions and Medicines', which addresses precisely the theme of this project: namely, rather than viewing religious specialists as politically agile agents who instrumentally 'use' texts to manipulate their clients, what further nuanced view will we gain by considering that religious change arises where texts, practitioners and their clients interact in ways shaped (or hindered) by a combination of technological-textual, sensorial-symbolic and social dimensions?\n\nStructure of the Project. The project aims to show how shamans in Southwest China interact with their sacred texts in practice, effectively rendering texts into 'works-in-progress' rather than into 'fixed entities'. To this end, the project brings together four researchers: Dr. Elisabeth Hsu (Principal Investigator) and Dr. Katherine Swancutt (Research Assistant for three years) at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, University of Oxford; Shama Shifu (Visiting Scholar for three months) who is a practising shaman appointed as the Traditional Cultural Specialist at the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County Institute for Ethnology and Culture in Yunnan, China; and Markus Schiesser (Research Assistant for six months) who is an ethnographic filmmaker based in Shanghai, China, with a Master's Degree in visual anthropology from the University of Z&amp;uuml;rich. \n\nPotential Applications and Benefits. This research is foundational to the anthropology of religion, exploring the interface between sacred texts, ritual performance and religious innovation. The research will contribute to and benefit from fortnightly seminars at ArgO-EMR, which have been running since 2006. Furthermore, the question surrounding the linguistic aspects of Nuosu and Pumi religious texts will be explored in a conference on the exegesis of other Asian divinatory texts and their sacred spaces, inviting Aur&amp;eacute;lie N&amp;eacute;vot (Paris), Michael Oppitz (Berlin), Pan Anshi (Edinburgh), Charles Ramble (Oxford) and Geoffrey Samuel (Cardiff). Additional applications and benefits are detailed in the application's 'Academic Beneficiaries' section.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?\nThrough its multifaceted methodology, the research will contribute to the international academic community working on religion, textual exegesis and interpretation. The project will benefit anthropologists of religion and religious studies scholars, specialists on Southwest China, linguists working on iconographic or pictographic texts and young scholars of Eastern Medicines and Religions at Oxford.\n \nThe project has also been designed to benefit the local Nuosu and Pumi involved in the research, Chinese and international policy-makers for China, Chinese ethnographic institutes in the public sector, and Chinese or international tourists whose presence and interest in the 'disappearing worlds' of shamanic groups in Southwest China is rapidly increasing.\n\nHow will they benefit from the research?\nBy documenting how shamanic text-based religions give rise to innovations, the project will bridge the theoretical 'divide' faced by anthropologists working on comparative epistemology and religious studies scholars more broadly, between the production of revelatory religious pronouncements in 'oral societies' and the seemingly 'timeless' interpretations ascribed by priests to texts in organised religions. The project will thus make inroads into the study of how texts, as 'works in progress', trigger religious change in either small-scale or large-scale societies, by producing a wide range of outputs: 'raw data' on textual exegeses, translations of Nuosu texts into Chinese and English, an ethnographic film giving direct access to Pumi religious innovation-making, and anthropological analyses on how religious change arises through the interaction of religious specialists, their clients, the imagistic (or phonetic) elements of sacred texts, and the social context. \n\nTo benefit the local Pumi, Hsu and Schiesser's ethnographic film will be shown in the village where it was filmed and at Sichuan University. We will stage book launches for the translations of Nuosu texts in Ninglang and at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, which will be open to specialists on Southwest China and the wider public of Chinese and international tourists in China. For activities with an impact in the UK, see our attached Impact Plan. \n\nChinese policy-makers consider it important to highlight cultural diversity within their country, and have policies in place for propagating the cultural knowledge and sacred texts of indigenous groups, which entail hiring village-based elites to work as 'Traditional Cultural Specialists' at state-funded, county-level ethnographic institutes. We would expand the research on Nuosu and Pumi sacred texts through fieldwork and collaborations with scholars in China, thereby benefiting Chinese policy-makers, ethnographic institutes in the public sector, and specialists on Southwest China, whose work contributes to the production of culturally-sensitive policies that promote different indigenous religious views and their impact on quality of life. More generally, the research could relate to enhancing cultural understandings between majority and minority populations in other nation-states.\n\nWhat will be done to ensure that they benefit from the research?\nTo ensure that the academic community working on religion and textual exegesis benefits from the research, we will hold seminars and a conference in Oxford, stage book launches, give film-viewings at the Royal Anthropological Institute's film festival and other such national and international festivals, while making our 'raw data' on Nuosu text translations and the ethnographic film available to the ESDS database.\n\nOur finished film-viewings in China will target local Pumi, specialists on Southwest China and policy-makers linked to ethnographic institutes.
