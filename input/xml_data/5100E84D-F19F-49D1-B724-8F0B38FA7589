At first sight, the two would appear to be mutually exclusive. Anarchism, an anti-authoritarian, egalitarian movement opposed to the power of the state and questioning of all forms of authority, including medical authority, would surely have been repelled by a 'scientific' doctrine that sought to eliminate the 'unfit' and champion the 'fit' as a means of 'race' survival. Paradoxical though it may seem, however, numerous strains of anarchist thought in different countries did in fact engage historically with certain aspects of eugenic thought and practice and provided a forum for their dissemination. By means of a historical analysis that situates anarchism's interest in evolutionary ideas, population control and the ideas of Malthus, anti-clericalism and revolutionary transformation, this Fellowship charts the intersection and the conflicts between - and within - the two movements during their heyday; the 1890s to the 1940s. In order to do so, the Fellowship focuses on the eugenics movement and the anarchist movement in five different countries where both eugenics and anarchism were historically influential - England, France, Portugal, Spain and Argentina. These movements are examined simultaneously and within a contemporaneous period (1890-1940), the years of both movements' maximum influence.

By using an innovative set of theoretical and methodological tools, from Foucauldian insights to feminist epistemologies, through to 'post-anarchist' interpretations, this research aims to transform the historiography of both eugenics and anarchism. The first, because, despite new directions taken in the last decades, a right-wing affiliation and a statist origin of eugenics is assumed, whereby any reception of eugenic ideas is interpreted as inherently totalitarian and leading to the horrors of the Nazi death camps; the second, because too often it is thought inconceivable that the supporters of anarchism could contemplate birth control, hereditarian notions or advocate the achievement of a 'well-born' population.

Three principal objectives are sought during the eighteen months of this Fellowship. The first objective analyses how important the presence or otherwise of the state and statist practice were in the articulation of eugenic thought and practice in the five countries studied. The state, drawing on current political theory, is considered to be not only a particular government, a set of policies, or legislation, but a varied political and social framework of authority that could be implemented through coercion, force or indeed consent. How did anarchist non-adherence and a lack of deference to the state alter the reception of eugenics by the libertarian movement? The second objective focuses on the transnational knowledge flows within eugenics, anarchism and between the two. To what extent was eugenics 'anarchized' and how was anarchism 'eugenicized' in this scenario? The third objective is to explore how the presence of another major social influence, the Catholic Church, affected the uptake of eugenics by anarchism. To what degree did anarchism define its engagement with eugenics as part of its declared anti-clericalism and the power of the Church to regulate sexuality and reproduction?

This research, trans-national in its remit is not merely historical in scope, however. By examining the reception of scientific ideas in the past, we can pose questions on the ethics of medical thought, on matters of choice, on the power of the state and medical profession, to mould people's responses to illness and empowerment in today's society. The Fellowship seeks to engage with these debates by means of academic production (one monograph, one journal article, one conference paper) and a public-facing exhibition for the transmission of the Fellowship's findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The concerns of this Fellowship are placed at the intersection between a number of broad debates in the contemporary history of European and Latin American societies within the context of modernity. On the one hand, the role of interventionist medicine during the twentieth century and beyond, the power and historical valency of ideas about human heredity, and the influence of the state and government in shaping these questions. On the other hand, the rise of social and political movements arguing for democratization, radical social change, and access to health care and knowledge about health, sexuality and illness. 

Although the chronological remit of this research centres on the first four decades of the twentieth century, many of the issues highlighted above are still relevant today, if not more so. Public confidence in science to resolve collective ills and the ethics of research are questioned routinely in European societies. Large sectors of the public are mistrustful of scientists, governments and state apparatus in respect of the motivations and implementation of changes to health provision. In a world of increased volume and rapidity of knowledge, linked to demands for greater transparency and democratization, social movements have been emboldened in respect of their actions. The context of consumer genetics and the 'new eugenics' give a prescient twist to these debates. Within this context, the rise of academic interest in anarchism, both in the present and historically, reflects a reassessment of the possible relevance of ideological debates of this nature in the past and in the present.

As Benjamin Franks, one of the editors of Anarchism and Moral Philosophy (2010) has argued: while on the one hand, there are 'significant lacunae' in research on the applicability of anarchist approaches to medical and research ethics, he notes that 'Examples drawn from past anarchist periodicals highlight that key concepts [of philosophy] and core social problems are stable features of the various constellations of anarchism'. This Fellowship seeks to explore this interest historically and by evaluating anarchist responses to questions of medical ethics in the past, wishes to inhere in debates in the present on issues surrounding choice, ethics, the power of the medical profession and the state to determine lives. Rather than aiming at changing legislation on this front, however, the Fellowship intends to make a contribution from a Humanities perspective on these questions. A project focusing on eugenics and a labour movement, anarchism, is excellently placed in order to be able to explore and communicate these themes. The fact that the research centres on five countries encourages trans-national thinking and seeks to make links between past and present debates apparent.

This research will disseminate its findings not only to an academic audience but to a broader public by various means. It will convene an exhibition of its findings to be displayed in the Parkinson Hall at the University of Leeds, an open space frequented by students, visitors and the public in general. This exhibition will follow in the wake of my January 2013 exhibition on eugenics in Portugal, funded by the AHRC. A series of talks hosted by contemporary anarchist organizations will be held in the UK. The Fellow will also disseminate his results at an academic conference and will seek to maximize the impact of his research through the construction of wider audiences of researchers on similar topics, such as his projected networks project on anarchism and homosexuality to be convened by him and Prof. Clare Hemmings (LSE). Finally, by means of the University of Leeds 'Arts Engaged' Transformation Project, the research results will be disseminated widely to a public audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>132249</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Anti-authoritarian workshop, Barcelona</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>491DECF1-A7D9-4BB4-8048-4A954187D2CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a talk on anarchism and sexuality drawing on some aspects of the research that I uncovered during my research visit to libraries and archives in Barcelona and elsewhere.
