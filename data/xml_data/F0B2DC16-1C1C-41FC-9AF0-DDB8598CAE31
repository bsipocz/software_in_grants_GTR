The affected eye is unable to see sharply or to read. In the UK it occurs in about 5000 people each year and develops in both eyes in 10% of affected cases. It usually occurs in the elderly. Treatment is available in the form of surgery where a gas bubble is put into the eye and the patient is asked to posture face-downwards for up to 1 week. This posturing is at best very uncomfortable and may be impossible for many elderly patients. The operation can close the hole in most cases but the vision only returns to near normal in about one third of patients.

The reasons why a macular hole develops and why operations can be successful are unclear and this has hampered the development of macular hole surgery. Most surgeons now believe that the macular hole is a split in the retina which then enlarges due to a tightening of the retina. They believe that the operation succeeds by removing tight tissue on the surface of the retina and because physical forces then stretch the tissue back into the hole.

At the University of Leeds Professors Greig and Savage in the School of Physics and Astronomy have been studying the forces involved in closing a macular hole together with Mr Woon, Consultant Vitreo-retinal surgeon at St James?s University Hospital in Leeds. They have previously examined the role of surface tension forces at the edge of a macular hole following an operation using theoretical and simulation techniques. However, they now believe that the forces produced during the removal of the fluid from the eye may be even more important. The edge of a column of fluid being aspirated over the hole behaves like an elastic membrane bringing the edges of the hole together. The objective of the proposal is therefore to simulate such forces by experimental and analytical techniques to determine the key parameters including the level of gas fill and the design and material of the aspirating equipment. This is not a force which has been previously considered by surgeons. We believe that such a refinement of the technique should lead to a reduction in the length of posturing, making the operation accessible to a larger number of elderly patients in accordance with the Cross-Council Lifelong Health and Wellbeing Initiative.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Macular holes are a defect in the retina causing visual loss in about 5000 elderly citizens of the UK each year. The condition is probably caused by a split in the retina that then enlarges into a hole due to tension on the retinal tissue at the edge of the split. The condition can be treated with an operation that has a 90% success rate for anatomical closure of the hole although only about 30% of patients regain near normal vision.
The mechanism by which surgery can close a macular hole is uncertain and this has hampered development of the technique. As part of the operation surgeons remove fluid from the eye and replace it with air. One of the forces that has not been examined is that produced by the liquid bridge that is formed in the latter stages of aspirating the fluid and this is probably the strongest force applied to the retina during surgery. This liquid bridge produces a gripping force on the retina and this force will draw the retinal edges of the hole together as the column of fluid becomes narrower. Forces also arise as the liquid bridge snaps with fluid recoiling onto the macular. 
The objective of this project is to simulate such forces by experimental and analytical techniques when removing drops of liquid from a model eye. In particular we shall examine (a) the motion of the contact line of the juncture of the retina/air/fluid interfaces and (b) the forces generated by the liquid bridge as it becomes narrower and then snaps. Variables would include the viscosity and surface tension of the fluid, the caliber, shape and composition of the aspiration tube, and the variation in the pressure gradient of the infused air. 
Such an understanding of the physics of the forces controlling the liquid bridge would lead to a modification of the surgical technique, with improvements of vision if retinal tissue could be swept into the centre of the hole in a more organized manner. Posturing of the patient following the operation would then become less important and make the treatment available to a wider range of patients. The benefits of macular hole surgery already provide a substantial improvement in the quality of life for elderly patients at relatively low cost, and could be even more widely available if the mechanism of macular hole closure could be determined.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
