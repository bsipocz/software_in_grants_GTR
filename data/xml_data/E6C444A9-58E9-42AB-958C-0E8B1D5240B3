It was in this century that the book reached full technical maturity, and established the domination of Intellectual culture that would continue through to the modem era. The printed book is also fundamental to how we conceptualise the age: our progress-orientated view of the early modem period depends crucially on our sense of the critical role of the new technology in encapsulating the spirit of the Renaissance and Reformation. Thus the printed book is inevitably associated in the popular mind with critical intellectual developments of the age, from the rediscovery of classical texts and the creation of authentic scholarly editions to the growth of pamphlet culture and the popularization of vernacular translations of the Bible stimulated by the Reformation. 

Far less attention has been devoted to other, more mundane areas of the book trade that in fact accounted for a very large part of the day to day work of Europe's printing presses. The established trade in school books and conventional devotional texts was at least as important as the more eye-catching projects of Humanists and the Protestant reformers. So too was the large market for recreational reading in poetry and prose, a market which, like the market in school books, built on a healthy demand that long pre-dated the invention of the printing press. An equally significant development was the massive exploitation of print for the everyday tasks of government: many a publishing house would depend for its livelihood on the steady demand for printed proclamations, edicts and statutes. At the other end of the scale, in terms both of intellectual content and expense, was the vastly expanded trade in technical and scientific books. This was a domain in which Latin continued to be the dominant medium, though with a significant growth of vernacular texts in such areas as medical science and topographical literature. 

It is a characteristic of scholarship in technical bibliography that the parts of this complex economy have always tended to be studied separately: either with specialist studies of themes or genre (such as medical texts or dictionaries), or the study of an author, printer, or place of printing. What is proposed here is to gather together all of this information, while at the same time completing a Europe-wide survey of printing. This involves both plugging gaps in coverage (there is no survey of print culture in Spain, for example) and drawing together information on surviving copies from over 2,000 libraries world-wide.
 
The U-STC will be simultaneously both the most powerful analytical tool for the study of the global world of print and an Invaluable reference work for scholars interested in any author, text or genre of printed book. Building on methodology developed for a project on books published in the French language, it will offer data on around 400,000 bibliographically distinct editions published around Europe. It will thus offer a single port of access to information on books published in Italy, Germany, France, and In Europe's subsidiary, satellite markets, such as England, Spain, and Eastern Europe. 

For researchers interested in a particular text or author the value of such a search tool is hard to overstate: particularly if their subject is an author whose popularity spread beyond their own native country. For scholars of the book world the complete survey of early printing envisaged here offers for the first time the prospect of a holistic understanding of one of the sixteenth century's most important and dynamic industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>665428</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The USTC is increasingly used as a primary point of reference in the antiquarian book trade.

At present this comprises 364,000 editions and around 1.5 million surviving copies, located in over 5,500 archives and libraries worldwide. 

The project has demonstrated, as intended, the value of studying the early print world across national boundaries. Until this point, the first age of print was largely studied within national silos. Yet at the time the Latin market at least functioned as one transnational marketplace. Popular texts, too, travelled with translation into different vernacular languages. The project has first and foremost helped users understand this active market of cultural exchange.

The data in the USTC has allowed all scholars of the early book world to re-assess conventional narratives of the 'triumph' of print. Until this point the transition from manuscript to print was seen as a fairly smooth process, inspired by the enthusiasm of scholars and the fascination for the new technology. The data in the USTC allows us to question this narrative, with evidence of a significant contraction in the industry as the first publishers struggled to find customers. The result was a wholesale restructuring of the industry, as the publication of large books retrenched to a smaller number of commercial hubs. Meanwhile the industry as a whole was sustained to an extent never previously recognised by the trade in small books and utilitarian jobbing print, much of this published at the behest of the state and church authorities.

This reorientation of the discipline towards an interest in 'cheap print' is very much an achievement of the USTC, which provides for the first time statistical evidence of its dominant role in the economics of the industry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The USTC is now the first point of call for researchers in many disciplines interested in the study of early printed texts. It provides access not only to the locations of surviving copies, but where available, digital texts. Scholars in many disciplines, history, literature, modern languages, theology, and the history of science, routinely use the USTC as a means of searching out texts, or creating a corpus for study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DDC80C22-79A7-4B29-969D-5CBB730CBE1A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d45979115638.48552035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ustc.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The completion of the AHRC grant for the Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) represents a significant development in the USTC database. Prior to the grant, the USTC database recorded of ca. 350,000 unique editions with ca. 1.3 million copies attached. With the culmination of the grant this dataset will expand to ca. 600,000 unique editions with ca. 2.5 million copies attached. Such a rich database allows scholars and researchers to study national datasets in a comparative perspective and for surveys to cross the traditional national boundaries of bibliographic study. In addition, the database has sought to record any digital copy of a work found. This will allow the USTC to become a research portal for the discovery a rich corpus of material for the study of early modern history and literature.
All the data in our collection will be freely available to the public from our existing website from 18 June 2016.
The website features an intuitive frontend and backend interface that allows staff to continue to develop the resource while users explore our collection and discover new research questions. While the data is stored in the MySQL data warehouse located St Andrews, this data can be modified by authorised project team members via a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Interface) interface. The MySQL database forms the basis of the Apache Solr Index (also hosted by St Andrews) which provides the front-end data to which the general user is exposed and interacts with. A search of the USTC will query the Solr Index and provide results based on the USTC number. This separation allows for continued modification and correction of data without the necessity to close service for updates. The Solr index is re-indexed at the lowest traffic point for the site.
Data Development Methods 
The project has developed a purpose built bibliographical database structure designed for the recording of early printed material. Each bibliographical distinct item is assigned a unique USTC number or serial number by which it can be identified. No two items can have the same number. Through this number additional tables of content are linked containing a variety of data such as publication data, reference data, external links, copy information, collation information, pagination and format. Data integrity is ensured as these tables provide a series of 'data dictionaries' from which project members have to select values for any new record.
Monitoring Data Development 
The project has developed a robust monitoring process based upon regular weekly formal meetings and record keeping. Every project member reports regularly on the work undertaken and its progress. These reports ensure that the project team is able to meet tight deadlines and ensures that every member of the team is aware of the goals of the team as a whole. These reports are filed for future reference. Additionally, documentation has been developed to ensure that any technical work undertaken is fully reported and any backups recorded in paper logs. This ensures that no work can be lost or is unrecoverable and that the USTC can continue to be of benefit to future scholars beyond this grant.
Data/file formats 
The core data for the project is held in MySQL format. This has the advantage of being able to handle large databases quickly and easily while being designed for use in an online environment. The use of MySQL allows the project to conform to open standards. The functionality of MySQL in an online environment also allows the project to ensure that the resource meets accessibility criteria (http://www.mysql.com/). 
The core MySQL database is indexed in Apache Solr. Solr has become the leading open access search platform for search applications - from library catalogues to major e-commerce solutions. It not only has a proven track record on numerous projects, but is scalable and provides many features of which the USTC can make use - full-text search, faceted search, geospatial search or automated failover and recovery. 
Solr is written in JAVA and runs as a stand-alone full-text search server (see http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ ). Database integration between Solr and MySQL is provided by the Solarium PHP client library (http://www.solarium-project.org/) The USTC on-line interface is written primarily in PHP; as such the choice of Solarium seemed appropriate and, unlike the native PHP library, requires no dependencies to be installed on the server. 
MySQL and Apache Solr are both open source published under the GNU General Licence, so no cost was involved in its acquisition. This ensures that it will continue to operate following the grant without the necessity of licencing any costly software.</gtr:description><gtr:id>31EBB311-9974-4804-A616-776D4292B5DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The USTC is now heavily used by a worldwide community of scholars and other interested parties. It is particularly valued by users with not institutional base in the university community. It now averages 350-400 users a day.

The database has allowed us to develop a new, innovative programme, Preserving the World's Rarest Books. This programme, sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation of New York, puts the analytical power of the Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) at the disposal of the world library community. It is one of the paradoxes of the early book world that libraries value most are often not particularly rare. The rarest early printed books tend to be works that were never intended for the library shelves: small, ephemeral or practical, used to destruction, then discarded. But publications of this sort formed the bedrock of the publishing industry. Documenting books (and broadsheets) like these is essential to creating a complete view of the early book world: both from the perspective of those engaged in the industry, and readers.
The St Andrews/ Mellon programme is intended to help libraries find the rarest books in their collection, a time consuming task for any individual collection, but relatively straightforward using the analytical resources of the USTC. Participating libraries will be furnished by the USTC team will a list of all their early holdings, ranked according to rarity.
Libraries are free to do with this information what they wish: participation in the programme imposes no obligations. But some of our early partners have indicated that they may use our information to shape digitization priorities; others may highlight unique items in forthcoming exhibitions or publications. 
Now, half way through the first year of an initial three year association with Mellon, we have gathered over 20 partners in 11 countries. The programme envisages a minimum of 50 partners in the first three years.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e01c07660860.83236467</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>USTC</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ustc.ac.uk/index.php/search</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23C4C579-64ED-41C4-971C-0ED034E61D2F</gtr:id><gtr:title>La voix de l'auteur?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d5cf2059db75b4eba5f90e4e995086c"><gtr:id>7d5cf2059db75b4eba5f90e4e995086c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Malcolm Norman Walsby (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_28279584456422cc80</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CE34BD34-FE08-4076-833C-51E39D4E0330</gtr:id><gtr:title>CENTRE AND PERIPHERY IN THE EUROPEAN BOOK WORLD</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the Royal Historical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7481c8dea0221f24f36c48ec40dc7b25"><gtr:id>7481c8dea0221f24f36c48ec40dc7b25</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettegree A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0120127e5f07f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2292D2FE-C8D1-4074-8C07-0BAEB5D43185</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Meaning of the Library -
