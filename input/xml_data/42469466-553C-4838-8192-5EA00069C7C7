Durham is currently 61st in the QS world rankings (70th in THES) and 54th for research citations and research excellence which strengthens this institutional profile. All EPSRC supported departments, including Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Engineering, provide a significant contribution to the position with exceptionally high ranking on publications and citations. In the most recent REF Chemistry (5th) and Physics (9th) were both in the top ten departments, and all EPSRC funded departments are ranked in the top 22 Universities in the UK. Research in these departments covers both &amp;quot;blue sky&amp;quot; driven ideas as well as applied research in close collaboration with a range of companies both multinational (P&amp;amp;G, BG, BP, GSK) and SMEs (local and around the UK).

A significant number of PhD places are funded through the EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). This is funding awarded to the University as a result of the research support won competitively from EPSRC. The funding is distributed internally to departments who advertise these PhD positions through departmental and external websites (e.g. findaphd, jobs.ac.uk). Typically these are advertised in early November though typically positions are available throughout the year (in particular places linked to industry). Anyone interested in undertaking a PhD in Durham, even if a position is not currently advertised, is advised to contact a department and potential supervisors directly. Training for students is provided both in terms of their PhD specialism and generic training such as project management, academic writing, and entrepreneurship. All students are integrated into the postgraduate community within Durham providing a broad multicultural and multidisciplinary experience.

Chemistry: The Department is extremely well-equipped, with excellent research laboratories, extensive state-of-the-art instrumentation and world-class facilities which are listed here. They advertise funding opportunities with a wide range of companies world-wide, which has led to a many high-impact publications and significant Intellectual Property Rights. Details of the postgraduate student training opportunities can be found through the Graduate Skills Portfolio.

Physics: Durham has one of the leading Physics and Astronomy departments in the UK. Students here are offered a portfolio of courses, including dedicated lectures preparing the students for their research career in Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics, Atomic &amp;amp; Molecular Physics, Advanced Instrumentation, Material Physics and Elementary Particle Theory. The Department hosts the EPSRC Soft Matter and Functional Interfaces Centre for Doctoral Training. The Department incorporates the Ogden Centre for Fundamental Physics, home to the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology and to the Institute for Computational Cosmology.

Mathematics: The Department of Mathematical Sciences is one of the UK's foremast research units, with interests in a wide range of areas: from Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics to Statistics and Probability. As well as receiving training within the Department, postgraduate students also have access to training networks including MAGIC and APTS.

Engineering and Computing Sciences (ECS): ECS in Durham undertakes leading research in a wide variety of engineering areas from micro-fabrication through to the development of complex computing algorithms. Postgraduate students receive School-specific research training from both academic and technical staff, having the option of attending advanced taught courses across all topics covered by the School. This training structure enables flexibility in training which can be seen in the research training portfolio.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1614798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509462/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
