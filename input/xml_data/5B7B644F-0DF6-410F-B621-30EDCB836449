1. We will build a ?HIGH STREET SEARCH, ROUTING &amp;amp; DISCOVERY APPLICATION'. The key features are that a user can;
 a) SEARCH for location-specific information using the travel time they select (so, ?shoe repairer within 20 mins?). By default, our demo application will use all transport modes simultaneously so at a glance, the user can see &amp;amp; compare the merits of each modes? travel time, CO2 emissions and indicative cost. The application will automatically generate mixed mode journeys ? so ?drive / park &amp;amp; ride / walk the last leg of the journey?.
 b) See ROUTING to a destination (e.g. shoe repairer) ? door-to-door, turn-by-turn, real-time updates as available.
 c) DISCOVER events, offers, exhibitions, fairs etc within a few moments? walk of their destination, or their route. 
The DEMONSTRATION APPLICATION that we build will showcase the Search, Routing, and Discovery features (above) and work over an API to link to our Travel Time Platform. This is exactly how we envisage the UK?s top 10 local &amp;amp; regional press groups will use these features when we commercialise our solution (Phase 2). 
2. MODELLING TOOL. Within this Phase 1, we will also conduct a feasibility study to determine whether we can build a modelling tool for transport planners so they can model changes to the transport infrastructure and guage the impact on the travel time catchment area of a High Street. If this tool is possible to build, we would do so in Phase 2.

So - we will build a demo application based on our Travel Time Platform API, to showcase these 'search, routing and discovery' features. And then also conduct a feasibility study into building a modelling tool for transport planners.

Each part of the application will help deliver more people to the High Street, as follows;
SEARCH. Many shopping journeys today start with research on-line before buying off-line - this application conforms to that behaviour. Searching with all transport modes simultaneously means the user sees the merits of each and all modes (travel time / CO2 / cost); e.g. public transport to the high street vs driving to the retail park.
ROUTING. The Application reinforces the ease of using public transport by showing the door-to-door route (useful since infrequent public transport users may not know the right bus number or stop). 
DISCOVERY. The High Street does (or must) offer more than retail; the discovery feature shows the user what else is going on within moments of their destination or route and since most town centres have a range of nearby activities while most retail parks have none, this feature highlights the attractiveness of the High Street. 
MODELLING TOOL. Sometimes adding bus stops / routes / frequency can dramatically increase the catchment area of the High Street, and this tool would allow the transport planners to model the impact of proposed changes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99672</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971402</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
