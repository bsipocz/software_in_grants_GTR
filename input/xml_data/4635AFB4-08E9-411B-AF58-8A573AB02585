The UK has one of the richest wave energy resources in the world, and technologies are rapidly moving towards commercial-scale developments in order to harness this power. Substantial industry investment is needed to sustain the pace of development, but in the current financial climate investors have become more averse to risk and/or uncertainty. 

In Australia, however, the Carnegie Perth Wave Energy Project (PWEP) will be the world's first grid and water infrastructure connected wave energy array, made up of three Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. CETO devices. This level of development has not been achieved in the UK, despite our position as 'market leader'. This represents a significant international knowledge exchange opportunity from scientific, industrial, and regulatory perspectives.

Proposed wave energy projects must carry out a detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) before any development phase can begin. The EIA is often based on information from a baseline survey, fed into models and used to predict any potential environmental impacts which must be mitigated and/or monitored throughout the life of the wave energy project. Complying with EIA regulations can be an unpredictable, costly and resource intensive process for developers in the UK, and one which can affect outside investment into a project.

Are Australian regulations less rigorous, or are the processes followed less cumbersome and more streamlined? Or are Australian companies more effective at achieving environmental consent? By assessing how the PWEP would fare against UK regulations, this internship will begin to answer these questions. Furthermore, gaps or areas of academic uncertainty within PWEP-type projects which could hold up the EIA and consenting process will be identified. By developing specific, well-thought-out, quantitative studies around the identified gaps, this internship will go some way towards reducing scientific uncertainty around wave energy projects.

This will go some way towards reducing the unpredictable nature of the EIA and consenting process for wave energy developments, making the UK more attractive to internal and international investors, building capacity within the UK industry to achieve the stated government renewable energy targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13208</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lunchtime Workshop (Carnegie Wave Energy)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC829976-9693-4C6B-AE7A-2207886C1D28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a brown-bag lunchtime workshop while working at Carnegie Wave Energy's offices in Perth, Western Australia. Attended by approximately 15 project staff, including environmental managers, engineers, and administrators. I gave a short talk about renewable energy in the UK and about some of the environmental hurdles which developers here are trying to overcome, as well as about engineering concerns which related to the environment. This sparked many questions and lively discussions between the attendees.

After this session there was greater impacts in the relationship between marine engineering and the environment - most specifically around the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamics and loading on wave energy devices.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54624aba689cd7.94760160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>93439</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellowships</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NE/M006999/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>302095B2-BE8A-4470-A6C3-733DC26A403D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546247bfe74584.69322727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult Feasibility Studies</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E4FA9BCE-99D4-4465-90DE-ACB78584856A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb4e3d58632.21940285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings have predominantly been used by Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. to help them assess their Perth Wave Energy Project in Australia, as well as to assess the transferrability of their environmental impact assessment and monitoring strategies from Australia to the UK.

1) Government support for marine renewable energy in the UK has been a key catalyst for the industry in the UK, and has led to the UK's current 'world leader' status. 
2) Provision for marine renewable energy development in the marine planning process has further helped to stimulate development, particularly in Scotland.
3) There is, however, a perception that the rigour of environmental regulation and consenting requirements are onerous in the UK, and could stymie the continued development of the industry. Key industry players (e.g. device and site developers) could begin to look abroad to other locations where regulation is simpler, and development consent more easily obtained.
4) Knowledge-sharing on an international basis could help to plug international consenting gaps around environmental concerns. When coupled with pre-emptive research and ongoing monitoring of developments, this could serve to facilitate the growth of the industry worldwide.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The comparative analysis carried out as part of this project has already been demonstrated to be of interest to other international marine renewable energy developers, and may also serve to decrease the understanding gap between developers and regulators within the UK. Furthermore, the assessment of the Perth Wave Energy Project is expected to be of use not only to Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. for their future development plans in the UK and Australia, but also for UK wave energy developers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6A014C4D-1AC2-4FB7-9228-37ACE6D3DE60</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54624fd602a843.46581464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>010EE835-2903-4DD2-AFB1-D0D5BBDC660D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Finding the Gaps: A UK-based assessment of the Perth Wave Energy Project.
