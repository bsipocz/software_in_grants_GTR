expect from user fee removal and financial incentives?</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/L012057/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Increasing the uptake of health services by the poorest and most vulnerable populations is required to improve health outcomes and more ultimately to alleviate poverty. Over the last decades, there have been many changes regarding the perception of the main predictors of health services uptake in low-income countries. User fees were introduced in most of African countries in the late 80's based on the idea that even the poorest individuals had some ability to pay for health, especially if the quality of care is high. More recently low-income countries have implemented several policies such as user fee removal, universal health insurance and financial incentives in order to improve health care use of the poorest populations. Although those new health policies have provided researchers with an unique opportunity to explore the role of income on health services uptake, the use of inappropriate methods to analyse impacts or the poor design and external validity of RCTs conducted in this area has failed to provide some evidence on the impact and transmission channels through which those policies indirectly affecting income affects health service uptake. 

I propose to undertake a comprehensive and original programme of research to address this gap in knowledge. Using advanced econometric techniques the research will first investigate the impact of income and health facilities' characteristics on health care use in four low-income countries. Then, I will investigate the effect of user fee removal in Zambia on access, out-of-pocket medical expenses and on economic vulnerability. Finally, I will investigate the effect of income for patients with different levels of risk aversion on adherence to PrEP among HIV sero-discordant couples in Nigeria. To do so, I plan to develop a small research project part of the PrEP demonstration project that will be implemented in Nigeria and will aim to investigate the determinants of adherence to PrEP in Nigeria. The findings regarding the determinants of PrEP adherence will be used to design a RCT that will highlight the optimal amount and the best manner to allocate the financial incentive (cash payment versus lottery) to maximise its effects on adherence to PrEP. 

The MRC early career fellowship in economics of health will thus provide for the publication of a series of papers on the role of income in the uptake of curative and preventive health services in low-income countries. The results of this research will be disseminated to an academic audience and to policy-makers through presentations, seminars and conferences. The production of this proposal will be supported by a series of training modules in impact evaluation econometric techniques and impact evaluation design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Motivation: Additional evidence on the direct role of income on health services utilisation and on the health policies that indirectly increase income to stimulate the uptake of health services in LMICs is needed to increase the allocative efficiency of health expenditure. 

Aim: To provide additional evidence on the direct and indirect role of income on the use of health services in LMICs 

Method: 

(1) The effect of income on health care use controlling for the characteristics of health facilities will be estimated by using instrumental variables approach to correct for the endogeneity of income and the availability and quality of care. The analysis will be conducted in 4 LMICs (Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam). I will compare the findings and investigate why income is a stronger predictor of health care use in some contexts.
(2) A double difference estimator will be used to quantify the impact of user fee removal in Zambia on health care use, out-of-pocket medical expenses and catastrophic expenditure. The econometric analysis will report the intention to treat the local average treatment effect.
(3) In Nigeria, HIV negative partners in sero-discordant relationship will be randomly selected in ART clinics to participate in a study that will consist in analysing the effect of income, risk aversion and their interaction on adherence to PrEP. Information on income and on direct and indirect costs of PrEP will be collected and risk aversion level will be assessed through a experimental economic game. 
(4) The results obtained from the research experiment in Nigeria will be used to design a RCT that will highlight the best manner to allocate a financial incentive (lottery versus cash payment) and the amount of the financial incentive that is likely to be the most cost-effective.

Outputs: I expect to publish those findings in top health economics or development economics journals. Findings will be widely disseminated to academics and policy makers.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research is anticipated to benefit to a large audience beyond the academic community, including international organisations and decision-makers and through these, the wider public. 

By providing additional insight on the role of income in the uptake of health services in low-income countries, the research will inform policy-makers and international organisations of the effective health policies that could be implemented to increase the uptake of health services of the most vulnerable populations. 

As highlighted in my case for support, Governments often decide to implement health policies that have a large impact on their fiscal space with limited evidence on their efficacy. Knowing what could be the most effective health policies as well as the best design to improve the health status of the populations in low-income countries will allow to improve the allocative and technical efficiency of health expenditures, which will allow creating fiscal space in the targeted countries. 

For the same reasons, the research is expected to have an impact on international donors (bilateral and international organisations) since it will provide evidence on the health interventions to support. In this sense, the results of the research project will enhance greater allocative efficiency of aid, which will save UK resources. 

Finally, the research on PrEP could be of interest for UK researchers working on HIV/AIDS. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US approved Truvada for use as PrEP and it is expected that a similar regulatory approval will be sought from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the near future. It is then important to know what could be an effective policy to support the adherence to PrEP in order to reach maximal effect.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>297853</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aix-Marseille University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Economics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Aix-Marseille school of Economics</gtr:description><gtr:id>A759F018-C69C-43EC-8349-66492251AF9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far we have written the following working papers.

1. Does Risk Aversion Predict Sexual Behaviours and the Demand for HIV/STI Prevention? Evidence from Sex Workers in Dakar

Abstract: We measured risk aversion among sex workers in Dakar using economic experimental games with real payment as well as self-reported risk aversion based on visual scales. Self-reported risk aversion was collected in reference to several domains: in general, with money, with health and with sexual behaviours. We find that sex workers reporting a greater risk aversion in health and sex have a greater demand for STI/HIV prevention and adopt less risky sexual behaviours. However, risk aversion in money does not correlate with risky sexual behaviours.

2. Measuring unbiased condom use and its determinants among high-risk groups: Evidence from a list experiment among female sex workers in Dakar

Abstract: Condom use is the main preventive tool available to limit the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STI) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Given that the consistent use of condoms is known as the most cost-effective way to prevent HIV transmission, condom use is the pillar of any HIV prevention strategy in most countries. The promotion of condom use is often based on multiple interventions such as awareness campaigns and the free provision of condoms. However, the evaluation of the effects of such policies is difficult due to the impossibility to directly observe sexual behaviours adopted by targeted groups. Researchers and policymakers have then no other choice than relying on individuals' declarations. Yet, one may wonder whether direct elicitation of condom use will provide an accurate estimate. In order to test the assumption that self-reported condom use is highly biased among high-risk populations, we use a list experiment, an indirect elicitation method that is expected to yield more truthful responses. The result from the list experiment indicates that 20.40% of female sex workers did not use a condom in their last sexual intercourse with a client, which is a significant increase when compared to the 2.75% obtained when asked directly. When estimating condom use among sub-groups, we find that HIV positive FSWs (estimated via biological markers) have a lower condom use (5% for HIV positive FSW against 80% for HIV negative FSWs). We also find that FSWs who believe that they have another STI than HIV (estimated via subjective expectations) are significantly less likely to have used a condom with their last client (65% for FSWs declaring having at least a 10% probability of having a STI versus 90% for FSWs with a subjective probability inferior or equal to 10%). Those results have important epidemiological implications in a country where HIV transmission is mainly driven by female sex workers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b382a2e823f9.05592300-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr. Carole Treibich spent several months in Dakar to supervise data collection on the field and is a co-author of the research outcomes that use these data.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration started when I received an invitation from Dr Bruno Ventelou, senior lecturer in health economics at Aix Marseille School of Economics (AMSE), to present a paper in a seminar.

The event took place at the STI/HIV division of the ministry of health and was opened by the director of the division. The workshop took place over 2 days and was attended by about 60 participants each day. This activity was high-impact because it led to a change of views of participants given that we highlighted the need to introduce a psychological support in the registration programme currently in place. We met with many actors of the civil society and sex worker leaders. The event was also a great opportunity to disseminate our results to our political partners and to make plans for future activities. Based on this workshop we developed a research grant application for a future research..</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ab06a9acb2.09649415</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://aurelialepine.weebly.com/dissemination-workshop.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paris Dauphine LEDa</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55F089D0-D81A-4B08-8723-E5191753784B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented the results from one of the papers I conducted part of the MRC fellowship that looks at the effect of user fee removal in Zambia.

More specifically, the data set will be used to work on a series of papers, presented below, that will help to improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention policies targeting sex workers in Senegal:

1. Cartography of sex workers in Dakar: we will analyse the place of work and behaviours by neighborhoods in Dakar in order to identify places requiring intensive HIV prevention. 
2. Effect of the registration policy in Senegal: using a matching estimator we will investigate the effect of the compulsory registration of sex workers in Senegal.
3. The effect of risk aversion on sexual behaviours: The paper will look at the effect of risk aversion in different domains (finance, health and sex) on sexual behaviours
4. Determinant of the price charged by sex workers: The paper will use econometric methods to investigate the effect of sex workers', clients' and sexual acts' characteristics on the price charged for sex.
5. Estimating the premium for unprotected and risky sex as well as their determinants: The paper will exploit the results from a game based on fake clients' pictures to estimate the condom and infection differential price as well as their determinants. 
6. Estimating unbiased condom use: The paper will use a list experiment method to investigate bias in self-reported condom use in the population of sex workers and among sub-groups.
7. The role of social networks in the demand for prevention strategies and sexual behaviours: The paper will investigate the influence of peers on risky sexual behaviours and the demand for HIV prevention.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c63b8f41da86.52163940</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data set on Senegalese sex workers</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://aurelialepine.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/1/5/17157580/questionnaire_senegalese_fsw_.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E7B338AF-3A28-4DCB-A601-5FD582357574</gtr:id><gtr:title>How effective and fair is user fee removal?
