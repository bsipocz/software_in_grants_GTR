Understanding and Management choices</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M008851/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The past decade has seen significant developments in the approaches to assessing and managing flood risk. Throughout this period major research projects (such as the FREE, Floodsite, FRMRC, iCOASST, RASP) and industry driven innovations (particularly within the insurance sector, water companies and environmental consultants) have all contributed to these advances. As a result of these multiple (but largely independent) strands of innovation the UK has established a pre-eminent position in the science and practice of flood risk analysis and long term infrastructure investment planning. Programmes such as the National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA) and the Long Term Investment Strategy (LTIS) (undertaken by the Environment Agency) have built upon this knowledge and continue to represent leading international practice. LTIS is particularly noteworthy as the first national infrastructure investment strategy that is explicitly based on national flood risk analysis. Although the past decade has been powerful in driving innovations it has, understandably, led to a proliferation of techniques that are difficult for practitioners and researchers to access and build upon. Many users are now confused as to what is best practice, and the credibility of the results. Recent publications that question some of these results have been a legitimate challenge to complex environmental models. It is now timely to confirm, consolidate and disseminate the current state-of-art through concerted knowledge transfer (KT) and provide the platform for future advances and collaboration between business and academia. 

The concerted knowledge transfer proposed here will provide a significant contribution to: (i) enable stakeholders (both leading consultancies and infrastructure providers) to capitalize on existing risk analysis capabilities to target investments to build resilience; (ii) reinvigorate a wave of co-innovation within system risk analysis and investment planning; (iii) maintain UK's pre-eminence in the fields of natural hazard risk analysis and decision making under uncertainty, and (iv) strengthen the competitive advantage of UK-based consultants internationally.

The FoRUM project:

1. Transfer knowledge and skills about flood risk analysis - We will consolidate the advances in recent years, including the approaches to the incorporation of infrastructure failure, spatial coherence with storm conditions and the interactions between channel and floodplain dynamics. We will explore the relationship between top-down and bottom-up models and opportunities for the strengths of one to be used to compensate for the weaknesses of the other. In doing so we will highlight recognized limitations and key uncertainties. 

2. Transfer knowledge and understanding about investment planning under conditions of future change and regional/local implications - We will consolidate recent advances in investment planning and the approaches adopted at national and regional levels. We will compare and contrast the techniques developed through initiatives such as FRMRC and the Agency sponsored Adaptive Capacity project and long-term Investment studies with those underdevelopment in the Netherlands and within leading corporations (e.g. RAND, World Bank). We will help stakeholders access the latest thinking and techniques to support investment planning and set the approaches being adopted in the UK in the context of wider international practice.

3. Promote a better understanding of the credibility of national estimates of risk -Through the use of case studies, we compare and contrast risk estimates provided at national (through the National Flood Risk Assessment) with those provided at a more local levels (through best practice local analysis). This will enable us to explore the credibility of the analysis at different scales and the uncertainties that users should acknowledge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Environment Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Long Term Investment Development Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>C18CD17F-FA6D-4C4D-B140-1FC506190423</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5a6ecc820d5.82401259-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Exchanged by Mike Steel in the FORUM project and then taking the lead on taking the LTIS DG forward</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Expert workshops enabled alternative approaches to flood risk analysis and infrastructure investment planning used both by practitioners (Network Rail, Thames Water, JBA, Environment Agency, HRW, AIR) and internationally (in the Netherlands) to be explored.

Following on from the first FoRUM Workshop (focused on national scale risk models) this second workshops addressed Long term investment planning. In particular, the Workshop will focus on recent advances in investment planning under conditions of future uncertainty made in both the private sector (e.g. Water Utilities); in Government agencies (e.g. Environment Agency) and in academic communities (both in the UK through FRMRC I / II, ITRC, iCOAST and internationally, particularly in the US and Netherlands). Some of these methods are finding their way into investment planning processes (such as the Agency's Long Term Investment Strategy, LTIS, and Thames Water investment planning processes) but a significant gap exists between the approaches applied in practice and the advances being made in academia (e.g. Sayers et al, 2013, Hino and Hall, 2014).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5afea3b7999.32842600</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/water/forum/workshop2.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference - Climate adaptation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51DDCB4A-386A-49A9-A32C-EC0067FC379F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation in the Netherlands by Jim Hall: Advances in National Scale Long Term Investment Planning for Flood Risk Management in the UK (Hall, 2015)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5ab89f01116.49925030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Evidence to Infrastructure Review</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4BD6857-F3FE-4F29-86E8-7A596510067A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paul Sayers provided a summary of the climate impacts on the performance of flood defence infrastructure to the LWEC / Environment Agency sponsored investigation. The analysis provided was published in 2015 by the Institution of Civil Engineers. His review highlighted that climate change can affect the performance of flood and coastal erosion risk management infrastructure (FCERMi) through a number of mechanisms. This review highlights that whilst it is well known that climate change can influence the performance of FCERMi in a number of ways, there is extremely poor quantitative understanding of the physical processes of time-dependent deterioration and the impact of changing loads (and the interactions between these) on the reliability of FCERMi. If FCERMi is to be more robust to future climate uncertainties, there is an urgent need for research to better understand these interactions in the long-term. This must be coupled with an updated approach to design and management that considers changes in extreme values, storm sequencing, spatial coherence, or more subtle impacts from changes in temperature, solar radiation and combinatorial affects.

The underlying methods, and various associated developments (e.g. Gouldby et al, 2008), have repeatedly been used to assess flood risk in England and Wales and determine the national investment need. Other sectors, particularly the reinsurance sector have also made considerable advances in broad scale probabilistic risk analysis. The context of flood risk management has also changed in recent years; with a greater local responsibility of flood related issues. In response more bottom-up approaches (based upon more detailed local analysis) are increasingly seen as one way of assessing the accuracy of '?top-down'? approaches. FoRUM seeks to consolidate and compare the detail of the alternative 'top down' and 'bottom up' methods and associated uncertainties together with more empirical assessments of the credibility of associated national risk estimates. This will promote a common appreciation of the issues by both the stakeholders and research community and help address the lack of understanding that is restricting further innovation.

This Workshop provided the first stage of this process and focuses on the approaches used to assess flood risks at a national scale at present. The approaches adopted within RASP (that underlie NaFRA) and Catastrophe models (that underlie insurance industry approaches JBA, AIR) will be discussed together with the approaches to validating national scale assessments. The way source (storm loads, spatial and temporal coherence etc) and pathway (e.g. channels, flood defences, floodplains etc) terms are handled will be compared in detail. The approaches to assessing receptor impacts (both direct and indirect damages) will also be explored. Differences in data, model structure and model components will be discussed. The workshop will be an in-depth exploration of the methods used.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5af9bbdd0d0.49060303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/water/forum/workshop1.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article - Steps required for a flood resilient society</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>605E832A-56D1-4D2F-9DAA-565A693A22FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paul Sayers explores the steps required to create a flood resilient society in the article 'We should not be surprised' as featured in the February edition of Public Sector Executive magazine. In the article, Paul stresses the need for a more strategic approach to flood risk management over traditional flood approaches. He highlights a mix of strategic management tools which could co-exist alongside appropriately designed and maintained flood defences. These include payments to landowners for temporary upstream storage, and affordable insurance options for the vulnerable. A strategic response to flood management such as this requires a greater joining up of actors (communities, government, investors) and their actions.

Expert workshops enabled alternative approaches to flood risk analysis and infrastructure investment planning, used by pactitioners (Network Rail, Thames Water, JBA, Environment Agency, HRWallingford, AIR) and internationally (in the Netherlands) to be explored. This provided particularly timely input to scoping future developments of Long Term Investment Scenarios (LTIS) used by the Environment Agency and highlighted the potential for a greater contribution of the academic community to these developments. Through subsequent discussion this led to the concept of a broadly based LTIS Development Group to facilitate this collaboration. The LTIS DG is now being actively promoted by Environment Agency. A number of articles were produced to help translate science to users: (i) National resilience review: An extensive response was provided to the NRR, highlighting the need for a more strategic approach and international comparisons of approaches to extreme value analysis and resilience (in the Netherlands and US); (ii) Towards a flood resilient society (Sayers, 2016: Cover article Public Sector Magazine with a circulation that includes Lords, MPs, MEPs and all local authorities); (iii) Communication of flood risk: The use and abuse of return period, frequency and probability (Sayers, 2016: exchange with Environment Agency); (iv) How credible are probabilistic flood risk models: Can they be relied upon in policy making? (Sayers and Flikweert: Presentation to the highly influential Working Group F 'Flood risk management'- EU 22-23 October 2015, including 56 representatives from national governments across the EU; (v) Validation of national scale risk models, England (Sayers et al, 2016, contribution to Appendix E of the CCRA).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Flooding is, ultimately, a people issue. FORUM has contributed to a better understanding of approaches to the assessment of risk and investment to reduce risk. Better targeting of investment to reduce risks make a legitimate contribution to improving quality of life. It is not possible to provide a credible assessment of the valuing of this with constraints of FORUM.

The topics addressed by FORUM remain issues with significant potential for both further translation of existing science into practical tools and the development of new science advances. The most exciting potential for future impacts:
? Exchange of risk assessment approaches with experts from Netherlands and from the insurance sector highlighted the significant potential for sharing lessons and supporting science (between countries and across sectors). This has the potential to form the basis for future science research submissions.
? Future collaborations through the LTIS DG - this is highly likely to form the basis of a stream of future collaboration, including a future submission to ERIIP.
? Publication in international conferences and presentations to Working Group F reinforce the importance and potential approaches to national flood risk assessment and investment planning in EU Member States (and beyond); an area of activity where the UK leads the way.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5426DD7D-E97F-42BA-9C99-119050581FAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e03f91051283.31018186</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/water/forum/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A structured framework for supporting the approach to validating large scale probabilistic flood risk models</gtr:description><gtr:id>911CA50F-08CF-46DA-956B-9D6ECAA6D1A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The validation of national risk analysis remains hotly debated.
