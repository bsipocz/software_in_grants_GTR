There are 8,000 new cases each year in the UK and it has been specifically targeted by the Chief Medical Officer as a priority area to tackle. Worldwide, the rise of drug resistance and the long duration of therapy necessary to cure patients (minimum 6 months) means that new approaches are necessary. This requires better understanding of how disease progresses in patients. Much clinical disease is not due to the TB bug but to the body?s inflammatory response to infection. This leads to tissue destruction which is driven by enzymes called MMPs. There has been much study of MMPs in human cells infected with tuberculosis. However, in patients, inflammation and infection will lead to a situation where the oxygen in tissues is used up. Almost nothing is known about the level to which the oxygen sinks in tissues or how this may affect MMPs and tissue destruction. This project will use tracers and scans to determine the level of oxygen in tuberculosis patients and then investigate the effect such reduced oxygen has on the control of MMP production both in human model systems and in patient tissue.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project investigates hypoxia in human tuberculosis (Tb) and examines the hypothesis that tissue hypoxia increases matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and therefore tissue destruction in Tb. Specific aims are first to document extent of tissue hypoxia in 12 patients with pulmonary Tb but no other respiratory disease and a negative smoking history. This will involve using [18F]FMISO as a tracer in PET-CT studies. Secondly, once the range of hypoxia is defined, the effect of this reduced oxygen tension on MMP/TIMP gene expression will be investigated in macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells infected directly or activated by intercellular networks. The focus will be on MMPs-1,-3, -7 and -9 which are key in human inflammatory responses to Tb. MMP gene expression is measured by real-time PCR and secretion by ELISA, luminex assay and casein zymography which provides an semi-quantitative estimate of total potentially active MMP-1 and MMP-7. Functional MMP activity is measured by in-house assay measuring transmigration of E.coli across collagen. Next the role of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 , NF- B and AP-1 will be investigated. First HIF-1 expression will be confirmed by pcr and nuclear localisation by western blot. Trans-Am kits will be used to examine which NF- B and AP-1 subunits are activated by hypoxia. HIF-1 degradation will be prevented by DMOG and NF- B blocked using either the p65 inhibitor helanalin or by the IKK-2 inhibitor SC-514 to investigate the role of these transcription factors in hypoxia-dependent MMP/TIMP activity. The second approach to transcription factor inhibition will involve using siRNA delivered in an established adenoviral vector system. Next, using a dual luciferase system, a detailed promoter-reporter analysis will be performed on the MMP-1 gene (and / or MMP-3/9 depending on the effects of hypoxia). The final aim investigates the activation of transcription factors and relevant MMPs in tissue biopsies from patients with Tb. Taken together this represents one of the first attempts to study the immunopathology of Tb in the context of hypoxia. Accurate model systems are necessary to indentify key switch points which are potential novel therapeutic targets to reduce inflammatory tissue damage and improve outcomes in Tb. In addition, this investigation will provide the candidate with broad training in a good range of laboratory and clinical techniques necessary at the start of an academic career.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252043</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Mason Medical Research Foundation/Imperial College</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Mason Medical Research Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EDA556F0-A0EC-41A2-A5C8-D955CEFA4AD9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>PB259wVuMDu0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BABF85BF-0D22-429E-A5D4-2FE9E6B26157</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hypoxia and tissue destruction in pulmonary TB.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Thorax</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f213b13205a6e212bace557f23e36a1e"><gtr:id>f213b13205a6e212bace557f23e36a1e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Belton M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-6376</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d610c59bc83.81056373</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0802271</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
