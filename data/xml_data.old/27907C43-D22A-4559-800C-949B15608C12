In such societies culture is one medium through which individuals and groups present their experiences to a broad public as a form of testimony. We understand cultural forms of testimony to include autobiographical accounts, novels, diaries, letters, memoirs, films, theatre, works of art, and documentaries. The network explores how cultural testimony can enrich public debate about past and present injustice, but it also explores how it is instrumentalised for narrow political purposes.

The network is innovative because it brings together researchers from the fields of history, political science and international relations, law, sociology, and those working on culture, literature, film and museums in a variety of national and transnational contexts. Researchers also work alongside practitioners who are core members of the network. These include a novelist, documentary theatre company, representatives from the National Holocaust Centre and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, members of expert commissions, and teachers.

We are primarily concerned with cultural testimony and the ways in which it is received and put to use. Of particular interest is the role that it can play in overcoming divisions in societies marked by war, genocide and authoritarian rule. The writing and recording of testimony in a range of forms play an increasingly significant role in civil society initiatives that seek to establish the norms for justice that are not restricted to legal procedures. This is seen most markedly in efforts to conserve and transmit memory of the Holocaust for and to future generations, for example the extensive use of eyewitness testimony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. These approaches to remembering the victims of National Socialism and fascism are drawn upon in cultural responses to authoritarianism across the globe. The network members and their case studies come from diverse cultural contexts in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Romania, Albania, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, South Africa and Rwanda. The network thus provides opportunities for scholars with different understandings of testimony to collaborate and to produce new insights into how culture functions as testimony as societies attempt to come to terms with their past. As the production of testimony in cultural forms is a global phenomenon, international collaboration is a core part of the network. This is also reflected in the constitution of the network's steering group.

The network establishes why victims, perpetrators and memory activists turn to first person forms of expression as they strive for justice and reconciliation. Used thoughtfully, the testimony of culturally complex sources can open up new directions for research that cut across generalisations about the past and simplistic divisions of the population into perpetrators and victims. Used in a fragmentary, unreflective or tendentious manner, this same testimony can be hijacked to support pre-existing political positions. In the 'age of the eyewitness' (Wieviorka, 2006) the network identifies the particular characteristics of culture as testimony, and it discusses how we can analyse and benefit from these sources.

The network's three workshops on the range and function of testimony in cultural forms, methodological approaches to the use of cultural forms of testimony in understanding the past, and the politics of culture as testimony are followed by a high-profile international conference. The research is further disseminated via a network website and linked social media, two half-day schools' workshops, teaching materials, and publications including an interdisciplinary handbook on Culture and its Uses as Testimony.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Culture as a way of giving testimony has relevance for academics and non-academic practitioners from diverse areas. The research provides producers of culture, teachers, civil society activists and those involved in the political processes of transitional justice with new methods and insights that will be of direct relevance to their practice. The collaborative research process ensures that practitioners have a role in defining and answering research questions and provides new perspectives on scholarly work in this area. The network outputs, in particular the handbook, website and teaching resources, are addressed to both academic and non-academic communities.

As described in the Pathways document, academics, practitioners, stakeholder organisations and groups are full members of the network and are directly incorporated into the research process through involvement in the workshops and conference. Practitioners from three different areas are represented, reflecting the thematic focus of the three workshops. These are: producers of culture; teachers and civil society initiatives participating in history and civic education; and individuals involved in political processes of transitional justice. One important partner is the National Holocaust Centre (NHC), which has expressed a research interest in different mediations of testimony. Three network participants are members of the NHC's academic advisory board (Niven, Mills and Wollaston) and the Centre is also host to the second workshop. The participation of non-academic practitioners in the workshops, conference and network publications ensures that their experience of using cultural forms of testimony feeds directly into the research outputs, as well as into the current and future research of the academic members. In turn, non-academic practitioners have the opportunity to discuss and reflect on their practice and gain theoretical insights developed in a scholarly context. Participation in the network also aids their understanding of the related fields with which they interact. The involvement of key representatives from these different areas ensures wider distribution of the research impacts, as they bring the outputs to the communities and existing networks of which they are part. 

These new connections have a long-term impact on future practice; for example, one output of the network is recommendations and resources for practitioners that deal with questions of authenticity, value and complexity in the use of cultural forms of testimony in school curricula and in the formulation of political responses to dealing with past atrocities. The global turn towards discourses of reconciliation and symbolic justice means that the questions addressed by the network are urgent and resonate across a broad range of practitioners involved in efforts towards democratic transition, as well as with those groups who seek to contribute to these processes through testifying to past injustice. 

The network initiates a dialogue between scholars, practitioners and producers of culture, which shapes future academic and non-academic engagement in this field. In this context, the network brings together scholars from diverse disciplines, many of whom have strong links with practitioners and local communities in their research. Participation in the network and knowledge exchange with academics and non-academics from different fields promotes the development of new approaches in their relationships with these communities. This ensures that the dialogues created in the course of the network's activities have an ongoing impact in the course of a series of follow-on projects conducted by network members. These include work with: memorial museums in Germany and Romania (Jones); the National Holocaust Centre (Niven, Mills and Wollaston); the Nottingham New Art Exchange and the Cuban artist Alberto Rey (Lewthwaite); Child Soldiers International and the Centre for Digital Storytelling (Gready).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Holocaust Centre and Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with National Holocaust Centre and Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA8ABD2C-D9A7-4A57-AD4E-55BA27695304</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop 2: Methodological approaches to the use of cultural forms of testimony in understanding the past</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c55e89915f86.59711561-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The National Holocaust Centre hosted the second network workshop, providing in-kind support in the form of staff time and a venue, as well as logistical support in the organisation of catering. Representatives of the NHC (especially Director of Learning, James Griffiths) played a leading role in designing the structure of the workshop in collaboration with the investigators and other theme leads. The location of the workshop at the NHC meant that workshop participants were able to access the NHC's educational exhibition (for which they provided a specially-tailored guided tour) and were given a first look at the NHC's on-going project to create interactive digital testimonies. Discussion of the latter in particular promoted exchange of academic and non-academic perspectives on testimony, mediation and education, which will be essential to the final outcomes of the research. The co-organisation by the NHC also allowed us to attract participants from a wider range of other non-academic stakeholders: representatives from the Holocaust Education Trust, Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, as well as local school teachers were present. We anticipate that the collaboration with these other partners will continue throughout the project and be key to the research findings. The briefing paper emerging from the workshop will be co-authored by the PI and theme leads, including Mr Griffiths.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The collaboration with the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC) is on-going throughout the project; however, it crystallised around the second network workshop on the 8 March 2017.

The purpose of the event was to promote interdisciplinary and cross-sector dialogue around three key questions:

Why do individuals turn to culture in order to tell their stories?
What can the writing of testimonial literature, the making of a documentary film, or bringing historical witnesses on stage do that other forms of bearing witness cannot?
How does this testimony relate to concepts of reconciliation and justice at an individual and societal level?

Alongside academics from diverse disciplines (literature, film and museum studies, history, political science, education, psychology and law), participants included representatives of the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC), the Romanian novelist Carmen-Francesca Banciu, and Eugenio Szwarcer of the documentary theatre company La Conquesta del pol sud. The first part of the workshop comprised five position papers given by academics and practitioners (Banciu and Szwarcer) in response to the core questions. This was followed by structured discussion around these questions and a lively exchange of perspectives between academics from different disciplines and practitioners working in diverse fields. Both representatives from the NHC and Banciu have since reported that the discussions at the workshop have sparked new ideas for their own practice. Moreover, Banciu and Szwarcer are in discussions with the PI around the possibility of producing a collaborative documentary theatre production based on Banciu's autobiographical narratives and drawing on the concepts surrounding culture and testimony discussed in the network. Following the network, the theme leads produced a briefing paper outlining the core findings, which can be found at the URL given below.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c669eeed9761.26945575</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://cultureastestimony.wordpress.com/2016/12/14/report-on-workshop-1-the-range-and-function-of-testimony-in-cultural-forms/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Film Showing: Son of Saul</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D08E7824-ADC7-4AE7-8948-9BF6D3C3E162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This activity comprised a film screening of L&amp;aacute;szl&amp;oacute; Nemes's 2015 Oscar and BAFTA winning film Son of Saul, followed by discussion with network members Gary Mills (University of Nottingham) and &amp;Eacute;va Kov&amp;aacute;cs (Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies). The screening preceded the second network workshop and was targeted at academics, postgraduates, school teachers and the general public. The event was structured in such a way as to give participants the opportunity to exchange ideas, especially on the use of films for educational purposes, as well as the impact of film on Holocaust remembrance. There were approximately 20 attendees, many of whom reported being deeply affected by the film.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c561b8947263.15519308</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://cultureastestimony.wordpress.com/2017/03/07/film-screening-and-discussion-laszlo-nemes-son-of-saul/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 2: Methodological approaches to the use of cultural forms of testimony in understanding the past</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2A74890-B1FC-41AA-90B2-E8288653E539</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second network workshop was hosted at, and in collaboration with, the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC) in March 2017. Representatives from the NHC played a key role in designing the structure of the workshop, which was also tailored to questions that are key to their practice. The principal purpose of the workshop was to exchange perspectives between academics from different disciplines and practitioners working in diverse fields around four core questions:

How can and do museums and educators approach both biographical and literary/fictional forms of testimony in understanding the past?
How can cultural forms of testimony, especially in the museum, function as a method of providing victims with symbolic justice or reparation?
How can one do justice to the complexity and ambiguity of cultural sources while using them as testimony?
What are the opportunities and challenges for educators, museums and other producers of culture in both using and creating testimony?

Alongside academics from diverse disciplines (literature, film and museum studies, history, education, psychology, sociology and law), participants included representatives of the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC), the Holocaust Education Trust, the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Romanian novelist Carmen-Francesca Banciu and primary and secondary school teachers. The first part of the workshop comprised six position papers given by academics and practitioners (James Griffiths of the NHC and school teachers) in response to the core questions. Participants were then given the opportunity to view the main educational exhibition of the NHC and an introduction to the Centre's current project to create interactive digital testimonies. This was followed by structured discussion around the above questions and a lively exchange of perspectives between academics from different disciplines and practitioners working in diverse fields. Representatives from the NHC, school teachers and Banciu have since reported that the discussions at the workshop have sparked new ideas for their own practice and resulted in a change of opinion. In particular teachers and educational specialists indicated the need for the production of high-quality resources for use in schools, which would help teachers to make appropriate use of testimony in their teaching of the Holocaust. This is an outcome that will be further pursued in the course of the network activities, especially at the teachers' workshops proposed for spring 2018. The theme leads (academics and practitioners) will produce a briefing paper outlining the core findings, which will be posted on the network website and linked social media accounts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c66b683052f0.48584185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://cultureastestimony.wordpress.com/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Readings with Carmen-Francesca Banciu</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A95E9CB-7B04-494A-B3A6-32F18199FE70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In collaboration with the Institute for German Studies' research network '(Not) Made in Germany: Imagining Germany from the Outside', funded by the German Academic Exchange Service, three readings by AHRC network member Carmen-Francesca Banciu were organised in Birmingham, Bristol and Lancaster.

The influence on the work of third sector organisations has principally been achieved through collaboration with the National Holocaust Centre and Museum (NHC) and, in particular, the co-organisation of the second network workshop in March 2017. The gathering of evidence is on-going; however, representatives from the NHC have already indicated that participation in the network has influenced their opinions and will feed into their practice. Initial responses from the other third sector practitioners present at workshop 2 are also very positive in this regard. Under the heading 'education', the school teachers present at workshop 2 and the public engagement events (especially the film showing) have reported a change in opinion, which will feed into their practice. They have also indicated the need for further educational resources around this theme, which is an intended output of the research as it goes forward. Cultural impact has been achieved by the inclusion of the practitioners Carmen-Francesca Banciu and Eugenio Szwarcer in the network events. Especially promising in this regard is the proposed collaboration on a documentary theatre production based on Banciu's autobiographical narratives and drawing on the concepts around culture and testimony discussed in the workshops. The network has incorporated six public engagement events to date: three readings from Banciu's work, two translation workshops and a film showing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0020FF55-C500-4C93-8B78-5BFE272EE8AB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c671e58d3425.80196835</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N008774/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>34457363-5AFA-40BF-BBA6-71DB708DF181</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Curriculum areas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE8091C9-38A1-47B0-ACDE-331864A8A453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law, Democracy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AD4F77F-8ADE-4FAE-8B36-11029C350EDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lifewriting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B33D3534-9854-416D-9412-CB4F732D0410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol.,International Rel.&amp;Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
