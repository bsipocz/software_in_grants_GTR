In the twenty first century objects continue to be endowed with an agency that qualifies them as allies or antagonists in the everyday. Objects in fiction and the animation arts have hidden agendas and motivations, often revealing or concealing complex information. Stories are sometimes told from their point of view. This research project is an interdisciplinary exploration of how writers and artists might use objects as a tool to understanding aspects of human behaviour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>192298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Script written for ventriloquist and dummy- conceived by Berlin based sculptor, Professor Asta Groeting, who created this project as a tool to explore the Inner Voice of an object. The aim of the writer in this acclaimed conceptual experiment was to animate an object with language; to bring the ancient art of ventriloquism in to the contemporary. The skills evolved for the writing of the script were focused on how to craft sentences that work with the breath of the ventriloquist/dummy.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8AC180C3-B4C7-455B-9438-45D3B575DA04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Performance (50mins) toured European venues from 2006 - 10.

Extracts of this writing have been used by various emerging artists across a number of media.

This research further consolidated for substantial BBC adaptation of two of Freud's case histories, broadcast in 2012- exploring dream objects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-5708446899.1574335a712c886</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>An imagined encounter with objects and subjects in Freud's Vienna</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.deborahlevy.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performance of script by acclaimed dancer Kate McIntosh.

Showcased at The Glasgow Review of Live 
Art (2009). The impact of the text , PLACING A CALL, was to design narrative in which objects conceptually frame and hold the themes of Time, Loss, Memory, The Uncanny. A public discussion on these interdisciplinary themes was scheduled after performances. This text will be published in a collection of Performance Writing at a date to be confirmed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-4953463734.084241a7135012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>LOOSE PROMISE - script for an object based performance on narrative</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://spinspin.be/proj.php?id=59&amp;cat=14&amp;title=LOOSE%20PROMISE</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings have been used across the fields of literature, visual arts, broadcasting, psychoanalytic theory, transcultural arts education.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B20A503C-426E-49E9-89E7-D90D2F3E2850</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463eb0c5b79b4.27442084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502071/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE53E60A-FE46-433C-BA16-151F707B335F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Creative Writing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EB45355-8698-4BC0-B58D-62C3276DD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film-based media (H, T &amp; P)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
