The virus is spread by insects (flying midges), since 1998 outbreaks of Bluetongue have spread Northwards in Europe and in September 2007 it reached the UK. The current European situation is severe with widespread infection of sheep, goats and cattle causing many animal deaths, and there is significant risk that a similar scenario will develop in the UK. Current vaccines available against Bluetongue are considered neither safe nor effective enough to be used on a widespread basis, nor do they protect from more than one of the 24 different strains of the virus. As prior vaccination for one strain does not protect against other strains a vaccine that will protect against all currently circulating strains of the virus is a priority. This proposal will develop such a vaccine, while maintaining the possibility to distinguish between infected and vaccinated animals, which is important for trade considerations. The new vaccine is only possible due to recent discoveries made by UK researchers, and uses technology which is not yet available in other public or commercial sector organisations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-vectored emerging animal pathogen which is currently having a severe economic impact in European agriculture. BTV causes high morbidity and mortality (up to 70%) in sheep. BTV is endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries, but since 1998 incursions of BTV into mainland Europe have been common events, reaching as far north as France, Belgium and Holland in 2006 and reaching the eastern counties of the UK in September this year. It is now likely that incursions will become regular events and plausible the BTV will become endemic in northern Europe. This proposal seeks to use a new technological advance, developed in the applicant's laboratory, to undertake proof of principle for a new type of vaccine for BTV. The vaccine will have improved safety over attenuated vaccines, be effective against multiple serotypes of the virus, compatible with current manufacturing processes and compliant with the DIVA principle. We will use a new reverse genetics system, currently only available in the applicant's laboratory, to generate a virus strain that is only capable of replication in tissue culture and not in vaccinated animals. This vaccine strain would be completely deficient in the production of key viral proteins and thus it will be possible to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals on the basis of antibody responses to these proteins. The techniques and principles that are tested in this application will be transferable to other animal pathogens, for example African Horse Sickness virus.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>568936</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Viruses can attack, multiply and establish an infection in organisms including human and animals. Vaccination constitutes a strong method to elicit the immune system and help to counteract this attack. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a new generation of vaccines for Bluetongue virus (BTV). BTV is an important pathogen of livestock and, although there are vaccines available, the complexity of this virus requires the development of new safer, more efficient vaccines. We developed a new generation of defective BTV viruses that cannot multiply in animals but can be used as vaccines. Several viruses were engineered and tested for their inability to multiply in normal cells. Some of these defective viruses were tested in sheep and showed that these vaccine strains could confer full protection against virulent virus challenge. Two types of vaccination schedules were assessed, a 2-dose (similar protocol as the commercial vaccines) and a 1-dose vaccination protocol which has a clear commercial advantage. In addition it was investigated whether BTV serotype can be easily changed using the same backbone of the vaccine strain. In each case the vaccination trials demonstrated complete protection in sheep against infectious BTV and none of the vaccinated animals had any trace of the virus infection. The data obtained is highly encouraging and has the potential to transfer the knowledge to a commercial partner. The output from this work should contribute to the development of safer vaccines with the potential to block virus replication helping to control not only BTV but also many related viruses.



The results and technology generated in this project constitute proof of concept for the development of a new generation of BTV vaccines. In two independent vaccine trials, DISC BTV1 and the reassortant BTV1/8 vaccines showed that both viruses were capable of conferring full protection in animals (sheep) after vaccination and challenge with a virulent strain. These results clearly demonstrated that the designer defective viruses are able to raise a protective immune response in vaccinated animals. Moreover, the safety of the vaccines was also tested and no virus replication was detected in the vaccinated animals. These results strongly support the use of DISC viruses as vaccines.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Vaccine will directly relevant to farmers and other animal produce producers.

As with the parental virus, this reassortant replication-deficient virus was also able to protect vaccinated animals against a challenge with the virulent BTV-8. This was essential to prove that the same deficient virus backbone can be used as scaffolding and only the outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5) are needed to be changed to generate a vaccine against a different serotype. 

Overall these results showed that the replication-deficient BT viruses can be successfully used as vaccine.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1243557018.4547055c6b45a6a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Reassortant virus strain</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - in vitro</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>These DISC viruses are compatible with virus entry and protein expression in cells.
