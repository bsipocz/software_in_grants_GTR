As more South Africans accumulate substantial property, its disbursement becomes a new terrain on which battles of kinship obligation are fought. This project approaches class reproduction through an ethnographic focus on wills and testaments: the processes through which they are made, and the disputes surrounding their execution. The result is an innovative lens that attends to the role of experts and bureaucrats in shaping the dynamics of class. It extends my interest in class reproduction, explored in my forthcoming book (CUP 2015) based on fieldwork in South Africa since 2006. In South Africa, as the post-apartheid black middle class ages and considers family futures, the project is especially timely.

The project addresses key anthropological concerns. It combines political-economic (inequality) and cultural (lifestyle) perspectives on the middle class, and these with scholarship on state institutions. And it extends existing work on class and status reproduction by transcending generations. 

How do black middle-class South Africans pass on the property that shapes their kin's status and life chances? As will-making is promoted ever more widely, how do institutions that facilitate it inflect experiences of kinship and property before death forces the issue? How does this compare with the established white middle class?

Within families, how are competing definitions of ownership, rights and entitlements judged? When expressions of future plans also become expressions of state regulation, how does this affect access to family property (e.g. township houses)? Who is included and excluded, in the bottleneck of bureaucracy and legal process?

How and why are particular possessions valued? How are people's roles and entitlements constituted in the process?

Amidst increasing inequality and precarity, how is will-making talked about? How have concerns about property and inheritance been reflected in the media?

Given the South African black middle class's diverse history, how does will-making today compare with the past?

Examining class reproduction over time means combining ethnographic and historical methods. For the former, I will begin with long-term observation in the Johannesburg High Court where disputes around wills are heard, and trace cases out from the formal probate process to fieldwork with individuals and families. Meanwhile, I will work with will consultants and lawyers, and interview judges, members of financial organisations, and the experts responsible for designing their online will templates. The former Dean of Law at Wits University (where I am a Research Associate) has expressed support, and is facilitating access to lawyers and judges. Taken together, the ethnographic research moves between institutional and personal processes, offering a bottom-up perspective that challenges easy meta-narratives.

The historical research builds on ongoing collaborative work with my proposed mentor and colleagues at Wits University, on probate records as a source for South African black middle class history. This aims to capture all relevant records over a century of South African history. My proposed project explores qualitative case studies and aggregated quantitative data, offering a longer view on the accumulation and dispersal of property. Foregrounding the complex and unexpected roles of state officials and institutions raises questions for ethnographic fieldwork. For example, as executors, state officials diligently spent inheritances on behalf of deceased (e.g. minors' school fees). Meanwhile, ethnographic fieldwork on probate processes, and the intersection of personal and official, will generate questions for the archive. Outputs will illuminate will-making among today's middle class, but with the depth of historicisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- The main non-academic beneficiaries of this project are legal experts, practitioners and civil society organisers who work to understand contemporary challenges in relation to inheritance in South Africa, and to expand access to justice in this area. Indeed, this project is distinguished by the centrality of non-academic practitioners, simultaneously as research participants and as beneficiaries. Will-making and inheritance are recognized as an area where greater access to justice is required in contemporary South Africa, because many South Africans lack the necessary knowledge to make wills in the first place, and because there are few means to seek advice and assistance in cases of dispute or exclusion following inheritance. By means of ethnographic methods, the research will offer legal practitioners a holistic, broadly contextualised perspective on will-making, to complement the viewpoint otherwise available in day-to-day practice. It will also offer an evidence base for civil society organisers concerned to highlight problems of exclusion currently characterizing inheritance processes in South Africa. In order to ensure maximum benefit to experts and activists working to expand access to justice, the project will involve them in the planning of research, during fieldwork itself, and during writing and dissemination. Indeed, I will seek in the fieldwork phase to develop a non-academic advisory board for the project.
- Less centrally but no less significantly, the project will have impact in relation to applied researchers, such as those based in Johannesburg's Public Affairs Research Institute. PARI has recently devoted substantial efforts to understanding the middle class in the area around Johannesburg, in particular through a focus on housing. The proposed project extends this applied concern with class and property, and offers new opportunities for knowledge exchange between applied researchers and legal and civil-society networks, and between these and the academy. 
- The project's outputs are intended to inform policy debates, through a policy report and further policy papers, and through a roundtable for legal and policy practitioners and activists, with an emphasis on guarding against forms of exclusion in inheritance. As I develop relationships among the practitioners and applied researchers mentioned above, I will seek guidance on how these interventions can have maximal benefit.
- The project is also intended to stimulate public debate. Popular interest in class and inheritance was evidenced in June 2014, when a research assistant on the probate records project in which I am involved appeared on South Africa's Redi Thlabi Show (Talk Radio 702). My proposed project includes a public-facing event, addressing and amplifying such recent popular interest in the middle class, inequality, and the post-apartheid future. 
- I will aim in the longer term to extend the impact of the project by incorporating its insights into my teaching, not only in the UK, but also, through my secondary affiliation at the University of the Witwatersrand, in South Africa.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142690</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the Witwatersrand</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>1590AA02-5F88-4151-AF70-B38BA26D4E48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wits Institute of Social and Economic Research (facilities and resources)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c693ce8ef285.00411943-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>WISER has provided me with an office for the period of my fieldwork in Johannesburg.
