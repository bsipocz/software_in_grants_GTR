The present crisis of the financial markets, which is partially due to the failure of instruments to cope with volatility, and weather phenomena associated to climate change such as El Nio, are examples of dynamical processes with a deep economic impact that require sophisticated models to take nonautonomous (i.e., time-dependent or random) influences in form of changes of parameters into account.The main goal of this research project is to develop the qualitative theory of nonautonomous dynamical systems from a mathematical viewpoint in directions beyond the traditional setting which are highly relevant to the applied sciences. In particular, it aims at characterising and classifying qualitative changes of such systems and developing computational tools for their analysis. The availability of a universally applicable bifurcation theory will provide computational measurements which are able to indicate points where the systems behaviour is about to change drastically, with enormous possible applications including the prediction of (catastrophic) events, for instance, in economics (stock markets), environmental studies (climate change modelling) or health care studies (seizure prediction).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal marks new developments in bifurcation theory. The classical bifurcation theory, although successful in many cases, is irrelevant for many real world applications. Due to numerous applications of nonlinear and random dynamics and the urgent need of new concepts in these areas, the proposed research is expected to enhance significantly the scientific expertise of the United Kingdom, with the additional benefit of technological relevance to the community. The next paragraph on early-warning signals will set out the case why the proposed research on both non-adiabatic systems and random dynamical systems is beneficial for the industry, the public sector and the wider public. The availability of a bifurcation theory for nonautonomous systems on a finite time interval will provide computational measurements which are able to indicate points where the behaviour of real world applications is about to change drastically. The study of early-warning signals is currently an active area of research in the applied sciences and has direct consequences for nearly everybody. The dynamical systems approach considered in this project goes far beyond the mere analysis of time series, but will provide tools for the analysis of time series (which are observed in real world processes) in order to detect catastrophic events. The knowledge of such tipping points in the dynamical behaviour of real processes will allow human interaction in order to attenuate the expected consequences. To be more specific, the project will have impact on many real world applications which include climate modeling (improved weather forecast), medical applications (epileptic seizure or asthma attack prediction) or economics (stock markets). It will be part of the project to develop and provide the computational aspects of the theoretical results, which are needed for practical applications. After the fundamental mathematical questions have been clarified, I intend to actively communicate with people working in the applied sciences in order to apply the theoretical research results of my group, which will help to promote the direct applicability of this research. The conditions at Imperial College are outstanding for this purpose, having world-leading experts directly available in various disciplines such as climate dynamics (Grantham Institute) or medical applications. We frequently have discussions in our group with applied scientists (from Imperial College) who come to us with questions related to bifurcation theory. For instance, we have recently spoken to medical scientists, who wanted to analyse bifurcations of finite-time EEG and ECG data sets of different patients who suffered from apnoea. After these initial studies in the applied sciences, I will get into contact with the industry to ensure the direct applicability of the proposed research. The huge network of Imperial College Consultants will help me to get to know the relevant people in industry. One of Imperial College's five strategic intents is to communicate widely the significance of science in general, and the purpose and ultimate benefits of research activities in particular. Apart from the publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals, the results of the proposed research will be made accessible to the wider public via different methods, for instance by talks in schools, for the general public or in industry, or by submission of press articles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>772143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>140000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Marie Curie IEF (New Challenges in Set-Valued Numerics)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>394ADFDC-EE95-42EE-9451-C137F5F3D0B9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546375e57d8ee8.03265419</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>140000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Marie Curie IEF (Low-Dimensional and Nonautonomous Dynamics)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Project number 330283</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>0F4FF91C-8B2F-49B3-A735-C1705F5F2D53</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6098241197.03680306a142c6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3500000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Marie Curie ITN (Critical Transitions in Complex Systems)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4C32AB07-524A-4A44-9778-36A0A0DB4FF8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546376db094080.87069232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The results of my research have been disseminated through meetings on critical transitions that I have organised which have been targeted to both academia and the general public (via public talks). Nonautonomous and random bifurcations have applications in particular in climate and ecology, and I have successfully applied for funding for a Marie Curie doctoral training network on critical transitions with a European network of applied scientists and mathematicians. 15 PhD students have been employed to work on this topic to solve problems in the applied sciences (mainly climate and ecology) with mathematical tools (on bifurcations and spectra) that directly relate to my fellowship research.

In addition to that, I am member of a working group on the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is funded by the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, University of Knoxville, Tennessee, USA. I bring my expertise on nonautonomous dynamical systems to this group and examine theoretical properties of the nonautonomous dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle and explore uses of those properties to guide observatory, experimental, and modelling research. In particular, I have led the research efforts on residence times for nonautonomous compartmental systems (the average time carbon spends in the terrestrial carbon cycle before it is released), and the theory I have developed showed a significant improvement of the classical (autonomous) approach to residence time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0D9F66C5-3012-42A1-AE10-DC29B79DA003</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5463df94042d04.27588704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant enabled the following main achievements:

1) Development of a bifurcation theory for random dynamical systems

The funded research forms the foundation for a bifurcation theory for random dynamical systems (generated by stochastic differential equations or random difference equations). In a first step, it was demonstrated that adding noise to a pitchfork bifurcation does not destroy the bifurcation, but leads to two different random bifurcations. The first bifurcation is characterised by the a breakdown of uniform attraction, while the second bifurcation can be described topologically. Both bifurcations do not correspond to a change of sign of the Lyapunov exponents, but these bifurcations can be characterised by qualitative changes in the finite-time Lyapunov exponents and the dichotomy spectrum (see below), and by collisions of attractor-repeller pairs.

The mathematics developed to study the above bifurcations in stochastic differential equations lead to a new understanding of stochastic resonance from a random dynamical systems point of view. This problem has been analysed in
the general framework of random dynamical systems with a nonautonomous forcing, and the existence of a unique global attracting random periodic orbit and a stationary periodic measure could was obtained. This stationary periodic measure can be used to define an indicator for the stochastic resonance.

Bifurcations of mean-square random dynamical systems as transitions from a trivial to a non-trivial mean-square random attractor have been studied, and a corresponding spectral theory to describe these transitions has been initiated (see below).

A theory of topological equivalence for random dynamical systems that corresponds to the above bifurcation scenarios has been developed. While the breakdown of uniform attraction corresponds to topological conjugacies which are equicontinuous, topological bifurcations directly correspond to topological equivalence.

2) Development of a spectral theory for nonautonomous and random dynamical systems

A spectral theory for random dynamical systems has been developed that can be taken as precursor for upcoming bifurcations. In a first step, it was demonstrated that the classical theory of Lyapunov exponents is not suitable for this purpose. We have developed the dichotomy spectrum and showed that it describes bifurcations caused by a breakdown of uniform attraction. In the context of mean-square random dynamical systems, a spectral theory has been developed that can describe transitions from non-trivial to trivial pullback attractors. It was shown that, although the corresponding nonautonomous dynamical system is infinite-dimensional, the spectrum consists of only finitely many closed intervals.

A Bohl spectral theory for nonautonomous dynamical systems has been developed in order to address shortcomings of the Sacker-Sell spectral theory (in certain cases, the Sacker-Sell spectrum does not correspond to growth behaviour of individual solutions). It has been demonstrated by means of an example that the Sacker-Sell spectrum can intersect the positive half axis, while the Bohl spectrum is negative. For this example, any nonlinear perturbation is asymptotically stable, although this is not evident from the Sacker-Sell spectrum, since it contains positive elements. We have been able to show a very general result, which says that the negative Bohl spectrum and some conditions on the nonlinearities of the perturbation imply asymptotic stability of the nonlinear system. This result applies to the above example and demonstrates the importance of the Bohl spectrum.

3) Early-warning signals for critical transitions

An early-warning signal for critical transitions has been developed which is based on reconstructing derivatives of extremal mappings of set-valued dynamical systems. The algorithm has been applied for performing a bifurcation analysis of the stochastic return map of the Koper model. This return map is a non-invertible mapping for which early-warning signals are a completely unexplored field. Further analysis concentrated on the development of a general spectral theory for the non-invertible case and demonstrated its use for the prediction of critical transitions.

4) Residence times for nonautonomous compartmental systems

Residence times are key quantities for the analysis of compartmental models coming from ecological and biological systems. Many of such systems are nonautonomous, but the classical theory of residence times applies only to autonomous systems. The grant supported the development of a theory of nonautonomous residence times, and it was demonstrated by means of an example that this time differs significantly from the autonomous quantity. A nine-dimensional nonautonomous compartmental system modeling the carbon cycle was analysed, which is a modification of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model. This research forms the fundamental theory for ongoing more applied research in a working group on Nonautonomous Systems and the Terrestrial Carbon Cycle.

5) Synchronisation of nonautonomous dynamical systems

Synchronisation properties of networks of coupled dynamical systems with interaction akin to diffusion have been studied. We obtained a characterisation of a class of coupling functions that allows for uniformly stable synchronisation in connected complex networks in the sense that there is an open neighbourhood of the initial conditions that is uniformly attracted towards synchronisation. Moreover, this stable synchronisation persists under perturbations to non-identical node dynamics. It was pointed out that these results can be embedded into a more general framework of spectral dichotomies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results in bifurcation and spectral theory lay the fundament for new fields in the theory of random dynamical systems. Previous results on bifurcations date back to the 1980s and 1990s and focussed on bifurcations which have no relation to stability properties, or the described bifurcations only appear in systems where noise disappears in equilibrium points. The results obtained by this grant are applicable to a much larger class of random dynamical systems, and we have pioneered new spectral measurements to describe and predict bifurcations in form of the dichotomy spectrum. Bifurcation theory has been extremely successful for deterministic dynamical systems, but the early contributions in the 1980s and 1990s have not led to a fruitful theory for the case of random dynamical systems. My contributions will also be very useful to develop early-warning signals for critical transitions. The theory of critical transitions is an upcoming topic in the applied sciences, and I have initiated a EU-funded doctoral training network on critical transitions with 15 early-career researchers at 9 EU institutions, which will help that my findings are taken forward by others as well.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DAD08507-BCEE-4D3E-9EA8-3A10465A1701</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463da9222ed75.09316184</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C931CF51-22EB-4E05-BBAF-452168E609AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards
