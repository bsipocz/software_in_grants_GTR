A beamline bridge is an activity (supported by local specialist facilities and expertise) that supports (bridges) access to STFC's national level scientific facilities and in particular (but not limited to) the ISIS neutron and Diamond light source beamlines (hence the name). Wales has a higher proportion of manufacturing based jobs than the rest of the UK and has clusters of large numbers of businesses of varying size from anchor companies to SMEs in a variety of sectors from metallurgy and green energy, to health solutions and semiconductor fabrication. However, this region does not access STFC facilities at the same level as similar businesses based in the South and East of England. This activity aims to address this disparity by First: Informing local industry of the capabilities of the local and national facilities and inviting expressions of interest, Second: Aiding in design of experimentation and completing proof of concept studies locally and Third: Supporting access to STFC facilities including post-acquisition data analysis and interpretation. 

The proposed centre will be built on existing facilities and expertise based at both The Welding Institute - South Wales (TWI) and Swansea University's (SU) Advanced Imaging of Materials (AIM) Facility. Together these facilities represent a critical mass of characterisation capability and expertise un-paralleled in the region. However, significant experience serving both local industry and academic partners has highlighted the limitations in capability even of these advanced techniques that can only be addressed at national level facilities, such as those provided by STFC. It is these facilities and this knowledge and experience that TWI and AIM will draw on to support local businesses on their pathway to the beamlines. The centre will employ business development officers (BIBOs) that will initially be seconded to STFC and then return to the region to utilise the contacts and expertise they have acquired to engage local industry, assess levels of interest and support them from proof concept to data analysis. Local industry will be engaged first and foremost via TWIs and SU's own industry engagement mechanisms (representing hundreds of companies in the region). However, BIBOs will publicise the centre's activities at relevant industry conferences and strategic partners EEF (The Manufacturers Organisation -who have a network of 25,000 companies) will broaden engagement significantly.

The centre will be closely aligned to Innovation Wales, Welsh Government's (WG) Smart Specialisation implementation plan with WG as a partner in the centre. The centre will interact with representatives of key clusters identified in this strategy such as the SPECIFIC IKC and the compound semiconductor cluster. Expected direct impacts of the activities include: Increased utilisation of state-of-the-art characterisation facilities with Wales, Increased and improved industrial research and development activity, Increase in pan-supply chain, inter-industrial and industry-academic research activity and critically, Improved utilisation of STFC facilities from within Wales. However, it is also expected that these direct benefits will cascade into indirect impact such as: increased job creation, increased economic output (and GVA) in Wales and contributions to UK technological and environmental targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will establish the first beamline bridging activity in Wales that is able to provide on-demand services to industry, irrespective of their size or financial means. It will be supported by two local facilities (AIM and TWI South Wales) with correlative capability in micro and nano-characterisation including, ultrasonic inspection, X-Ray CT and electron microscopy &amp;amp; microanalysis that currently supports academic and industrial research in advanced materials and beyond in the region.
The centre's direct impacts include:
* Increased utilisation of state-of-the-art characterisation facilities for Great Technologies
* Increased and improved industrial research and development activity 
* Increase in pan-supply chain, inter-industrial and industry-academic research activity 
* Improved utilisation of STFC facilities from within Wales
* Increased knowledge-base of advanced characterisation at a direct industry level (work-based learning) and for those studying in the academic environment to address ISS
* Increase in the number of world class research outputs, research investment and research active academic staff for UK

In the longer term, indirect impacts will be seen in job creation within UK industry, increased economic output in the UK; contributions to UK technological and environmental targets aligned to EPSRC Grand Challenges, and increased public understanding and awareness of science and engineering.

The regional industry base (the beneficiaries) will be engaged via the following existing industry engagement mechanisms: 1) TWI membership (In excess of 1700 companies), 2) SU's ASTUTE program (300 businesses in West Wales and the Valleys engaged, predominantly SMEs), 3) The SU materials and manufacturing academy (&amp;gt;50 companies supporting Masters and doctoral projects) 4) The EEF Network (over 25,000 companies) 4) Key industry / academic clusters aligned to Innovation Wales, Welsh Government's Smart Specialisation implementation plan, these include (but are not limited to) the SPECIFIC IKC in construction technology, and the compound semiconductor cluster. 

The centre will function as a conduit between this local industry base and STFC. Local facilities housed at AIM and TWI will act as a gateway, exploring (where necessary) diverse industrial characterisation challenges up to laboratory capability. Then the centre will provide local support for industrial research requiring more advanced central facilities at Diamond, ISIS etc. Support will also be provided in understanding, interpretation, and processing of data, using the centre's own and HPC Wales' resource, with the aim of encouraging sustainable engagement between STFC and local businesses into the future.

Economic impacts will be realised in commercialised technology based on the outputs arising from STFC-supported research. The efficacy of the approach will be measured using structured impact tracking methods currently tried and tested at both TWI and SU. The increased support for local industry that this proposal will deliver will mean the centre has significant potential to support commercialisation and innovation in SMEs as well as larger companies who have not previously accessed STFC facilities.

Researchers associated with the centre's activities will also undertake Public Engagement and outreach, building on the University's experience of proven initiatives such as Research as Art and Materials:Live. The increased local expertise generated will also be disseminated via bespoke work-based learning packages delivered by SU's Materials Education Training and Learning scheme. Together, these activities will help to highlight the centre to a wider audience, particularly through engagement with the EEF and Smart Specialisation clusters.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>710878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R006105/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FA25733D-A456-4A1B-9D5C-7119577368D9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Manufacturing</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA992CBF-8F56-4B55-AF51-A6876E825318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design &amp; Testing Technology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EAAD5EA-2E54-4986-942F-2E204958FE29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>High Performance Computing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A9D6C5-792D-4DD9-9138-BEC1BB556AA9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Technology and method dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
