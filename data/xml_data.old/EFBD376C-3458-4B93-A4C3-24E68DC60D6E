The Royal Society wishes to organise a number of high-profile events for 2015, to celebrate the 350th anniversary and to stimulate public debate about the future of scholarly publishing. As part of these celebrations, funding is being sought for two linked projects on the history of the Philosophical Transactions, both based at the University of St Andrews. The current application is for two postdoctoral researchers and the appropriate support to create an anniversary history, associated articles and a set of quantitative data series derived from the Philosophical Transactions archives which can be used to investigate long-term patterns and trends in the British book trade. (A separate application for funding for two doctoral students is pending.) As well as underpinning the anniversary events, the resulting scholarship will speak to academic communities in the history of science, the history of publishing and economic history.

The significance of the Philosophical Transactions is well-known to scholars working on the history of science and on the history of scholarly publishing. Its origins and function in the newly-founded Royal Society in Restoration England have been repeatedly discussed by historians of early modern science. The literary qualities of its articles have been extensively analysed by literary and communications scholars, interested in the rhetoric of science; and its citation patterns have been studied by sociologists of science as evidence of the functioning of past communities of scientists. The key strength of our proposed project is our emphasis upon the archival materials, to investigate the commercial, economic and editorial practices which lie behind the published pages. In this, we will build upon the existing scholarship on the early years of the Philosophical Transactions, but will pursue the story into the era of industrial printing, the professionalization of science, and ultimately, electronic publishing. Our emphasis will not be on pioneering innovations, but on the gradual development, adaptation and decline of editorial practices, commercial strategies and technological processes over the long dur&amp;eacute;e.

This project will use the Royal Society's publishing division to investigate the challenges and opportunities of scholarly publishing over the past 350 years. In its earliest days, Philosophical Transactions was a private venture of the Royal Society's secretary; in the eighteenth century, it became an official Society publication; in the nineteenth century, it faced new competition from commercial science journals and from the journals launched by newer, more specialised, learned societies; in the twentieth century, scholarly publishing became increasingly commercialised, and questions were asked about the ownership and reliability of research results. Neither the continuing vigour of learned society journals in general, nor of the Royal Society's journals in particular, can be taken for granted: the Royal Society itself, for instance, came under vigorous criticism in the early nineteenth century for failing to support professional scientific experts, while its journal was simultaneously under pressure from a range of new competitors. Both the Society and the Philosophical Transactions survived, but such episodes will enable us to look critically at the contingent development of the processes and practices that are now taken to be essential to the operation of modern scientific research. By the end of the project, we should better understand the origins of the processes we now use, and we may find contemporary options in some of the paths-not-taken. This project is firmly historical, but, by touching on issues at the heart of the knowledge-based economy, it has substantial contemporary relevance to a wide audience of policy makers, educators and campaigners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's research questions touch on issues at the heart of the knowledge-based economy, and are thus of relevance to a wide audience of policy makers, educators and campaigners. The results of this project therefore have the potential to reach further than the natural audience of members of the public with an interest in the history of science and technology.

- Members of the public with an interest in the history of science and technology will benefit from a fuller understanding of the development of modern systems for communicating the results of scientific research. In contrast to earlier work on scientific periodicals, this project will fit science publishing into a social, cultural and economic context, and will present a human-focused history rather than a bibliographical history. The breadth of its chronological focus will enable us to incorporate the existing work on seventeenth and nineteenth century scientific periodicals into a bigger picture.

- policy-makers at a national level are already concerned about the reliability and communication of scientific research, as can be seen in the recent Commons Select Committee report on 'Peer review in scientific publications' (July 2011). By investigating the historical development of peer review, and of commercial versus learned society publishing, this project engages with these concerns. It will offer a more nuanced history of these areas to inform the preamble to any future reports; it may also reveal some 'roads not taken', which could help stimulate debate about the future of scientific publishing.

- members of the public with an interest in the accessibility of scientific research should also be interested in the results of this project, since it involves questions about who should publish, where they should publish, and how the editorial processes work. The recent campaign to gain public access to the climate change results of the team at the University of East Anglia reveals the high level of public interest in the accessibility of scientific research, and scepticism about the way in which published papers adequately reflect the research.

- educators at secondary and tertiary levels may also find the project of relevance to their work in developing students' understanding of how science works. Discussing their historical development can enable critical thinking about editorial and commercial processes that, in the contemporary context, appear as unchallengeable components of science.

The partners are keen that this project should have impact beyond the academic community. The Royal Society is itself at the forefront of debates about the future of scientific publishing, the nature of scientific openness and its abuses, plagiarism, and future formats including digital journals. Their close connection with the Royal Society will allow the postdoctoral researchers to investigate historical topics with one eye on the leading edge of a fast-moving debate on the nature of the scientific journal in the digital age.

The project team will work with the Royal Society's Exhibitions and Events Team, and with the two separately-funded doctoral students, on the organisation of a number of events in the anniversary year 2015. These are expected to include:
- a public exhibition celebrating the history of the journal
- one or more public lectures, connected to the exhibition
- at least two public engagement events, connected to the anniversary conference; perhaps structured as panel discussions focusing around the issues of peer review, and of open access vs commercial publishing
- publicity for all the events via posts on 'In verba', the Royal Society's blog</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>795121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PEERE</gtr:description><gtr:id>C31AFE59-71EA-44A3-B167-45ED381772A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A preliminary paper was presented at the Vilnius PEERE meeting in March 2017:

We were able to bring the history of scientific journals to new audiences, and to engage with scientists, editors, publishers, policy makers and campaigners over the future of scholarly publishing, the circulation of knowledge, and peer review.

We curated a public exhibition on 'Philosophical Transactions: 350 years of publishing at the Royal Society (1665 - 2015)'. It ran at the Royal Society from December 2014 to June 2015. One visitor reported 'I was delighted to observe a most marvellous exhibition! It's amazing to see how much science has changed in some ways over the years, but in other ways is still much the same'. The accompanying 28pp brochure was published in print and open-access online (December 2014). 70 copies were mailed to selected senior scientists, policy makers and historians; a further 300 copies have been picked up by visitors to the Royal Society. The exhibition and brochure were the first outputs of the project, and made public the broad lines of the arguments that will follow in our books. They have been crucial in generating attention for our research among publishers, editors, science commentators and learned societies.

The exhibition was reported in Times Higher, Research Fortnight, and The Scientist; images from it were featured in a Guardian Higher Education picture gallery. Associated articles by project team members appeared on the blogs run by the Royal Society, by COPAC, and on the Guardian's 'H-word' and 'Political Science' blogs, as well as in History Today and Neue Z&amp;uuml;rcher Zeitung (Z&amp;uuml;rich). Aileen Fyfe spoke at a Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique in St Andrews, and was interviewed for Radio 4's 'Inside science'. Other team members advised on the historical content of the Royal Society's series of short films about famous scientific papers; and on the commentaries accompanying famous papers reprinted in the Philosophical Transactions in 2015. We also ran two public evening discussion events in March 2015, focused on the changes in scientific authorship, editing and publishing over the last few decades.

The 'Future of Scholarly Scientific Communication' was the theme of a four-day discussion meeting hosted by the Royal Society in April-May 2015. Aileen Fyfe was the only humanities scholars invited to speak; and she was also asked to give a 'Dragon's Den' pitch on potential funding models for scholarly communication. Fyfe wrote articles on both peer review and publishing models for the Times Higher, and it is clear from Twitter and subsequent invitations that she now has a public profile as an expert on the history of scientific journals who is willing and able to engage with contemporary debates.

Fyfe have since been invited to address three scholarly publishers' trade associations and a library association: the Research Libraries UK group (declined), the Association of Learned and Professional Scholarly Publishers (London, September 2015), the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (Amsterdam, September 2015) and the Association of American University Presses (Philadelphia, June 2016).She has also been interviewed on podcasts for the Royal Society of Chemistry (September 2015) and Public Library of Science (PLOScast, to be released March 2016). Fyfe's talks have received direct thanks from individuals associated with Brill, PLOS, High Wire Press, Cambridge University Press, and University of Adelaide Press. The organisers of the OASPA meeting tweeted 'So @AileenFyfe was a good suggestion as a keynote then?!' 'A fantastic suggestion!' 'Yes - she needs to speak every year!' The Chief Executive of ALPSP wrote: 'I just wanted to say thank you very much for presenting such an interesting overview of the history of peer review. I received excellent feedback from delegates, many of whom were unaware of how it has developed over the years. Enlightening how changes come around again, and some things we think are innovative are certainly not!'</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E89004C6-89FC-4208-8EF0-FFDEDF606E21</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5d3aba9cb9.07081503</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are developing a dataset of the economic aspects of the publishing of the Philosophical Transactions, e.g. the production costs, and sales income.
