Importantly, firms in emerging industries can potentially benefit from absorbing knowledge from existing innovative industries. For instance, the prominent UK motor sports industry is now working on innovations such as alternative fuels or energy storage systems which are relevant for the emerging cleantech (clean technologies) industry. However many aspects of knowledge transactions across organisations and industries are poorly understood, and more detailed empirical research is needed to understand the drivers and barriers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project seeks to fill this gap by examining the mechanisms and enablers of, and barriers to, successful knowledge transactions from the UK motorsport industry to the emerging UK cleantech industry. Furthermore it explores the implications for knowledge management and innovation policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research focuses on in-depth case studies of examples of knowledge transactions between motorsport companies and cleantech companies. This involves an investigation of organisational processes and key factors that facilitate or inhibit successful knowledge transactions. The units of analysis are the technology managers and engineers that are involved in the knowledge transactions. The primary data collection method will be semi-structured interviews. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Can motorsport valley drive us green?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>C6EED42D-5FA8-48C3-99E6-7B75298A064C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar presentation explores the scope of a fun-centred, technology-driven approach for sustainability. It discusses the potential contribution of the English motorsport industry for the development and diffusion of clean technologies, which either reduce the use of natural resources or enable the use of renewable energy sources. Motorsport epitomises a wasteful way of life. Yet, its focus on maximising speed and efficiency could potentially be directed towards developing clean technologies.

On the basis of interviews and document analyses, the presentation discusses the enablers of, and barriers to, technology 'transfer' between motorsport and cleantech within the context of the multi-level perspective of sustainability transitions. The results highlight that the right institutional setting needs to be in place for unleashing the potential of motorsport for green innovation. In particular, this concerns sophisticated motorsport regulation and government-funded consortia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9311579390.7191412ab848f8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Is motorsport driving us green?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>0B634676-C00F-4ADD-BA17-78DE505DA19B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar presents first results of a research project on knowledge linkages between UK motorsport and cleantech. First, the presentation discusses various mechanisms of knowledge and technology transactions between UK motorsport and cleantech applications outside of motorsport. Second, the enablers of, and barriers to, successful knowledge/technology transactions are critically discussed. This highlights the vital role of sophisticated motorsport regulation and government-funded consortia. Overall, the results suggest that, given the right institutional regulation, fun-seeking, 'lavish' institutions such as motorsport can be an important contribution to an innovation-based transition towards sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5006495215.9360942aaf1f80</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Can Motorsport Valley evolve into cleantech?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>09BDD9C9-CF45-4DA4-8AA2-896A9CF8775E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar presentation and full travel scholarship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9525469298.9638732a9ba068</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Given that the project was intended to last for two years, but the grant ended after about one year, the analysis is still ongoing, and the project findings below should be understood as preliminary findings.



First, the results identify and characterise the following mechanisms: 

- Spin-off companies to cleantech using human capital, personal contacts and suppliers from motorsport.

- Other R&amp;amp;D collaboration between motorsport and cleantech, in particular in the form of industry consortia funded by the Technology Strategy Board.

- Suppliers/consultancies for motorsport that are also working on cleantech outside of motorsport.

- Movement of people/embodied knowledge from motorsport to cleantech.

Regarding specific technologies, a key example is flywheel KERS technology out of Formula One that is now developed and adapted for buses, cars, trains and energy storage in buildings by several firms. Other examples include software for optimising air traffic control and new blades and control units for wind turbines.

Furthermore, the mechanisms not only concern transactions of technological knowledge but also attitudes and organisational processes for innovating under severe time pressure.

In a paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society Annual International Conference 2011, the significance of those mechanisms was discussed.



Second, the results confirmed that motorsport's technological expertise in efficiency and organisational processes for rapid innovation represent important enablers for knowledge transactions with cleantech.

However, important barriers for knowledge transactions have been identified:

- Structural differences between motorsport and 'mainstream' applications in terms of reliability, safety regulations, speed of development, costs, scale of production, noise and vibration.

- Limited exploitation outside of motorsport because of extreme time-pressure and competition/confidentiality.

- Motorsport often used for PR/showcasing of existing technology rather than R&amp;amp;D of new technology. 

- Conservative, highly restrictive motorsport regulation (this limits the scope for more radical innovation).

- Conservative traditional fan base (which for example loves loud engines).



Third, the results suggest that there are two factors that can help overcoming the barriers between motorsport and cleantech.

First, the results suggest that publicly funded consortia (e.g. by the Technology Strategy Board) are critical in (i) bringing together motorsport and non-motorsport companies around cleantech, and (ii) funding of (technological and market) risk reduction.

Second, new motorsport regulations, which provide more incentives for developing cleantech are vital. In addition to incrementally innovative regulation in 'big' motorsport such as Formula One, radically new racing series such as TTXGP electric motorracing or the EV Cup appear to be promising. Importantly, in addition to technology development, motorsport can contribute to making 'green' products more attractive to the general public.

However, the full picture of energy use/emissions and potential 'greenwashing' campaigns need to be critically examined.



To conclude, the preliminary results show why and how motorsport can enable important knowledge transactions with the emerging cleantech industry. However, this does not happen automatically, but requires the right institutional settings in terms of motorsport regulation and public funding arrangements.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Innovation managers in organisations and policy makers facilitating innovation could tap into the insights of how to provides institutional incentives for cross-industry innovation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FF406393-230B-480E-A32B-8BB38E2A0C91</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-424542958.3122422777593a14</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>418DE010-6D41-4F5A-8093-299A8A903765</gtr:id><gtr:title>The transition towards sustainability : can motorsport drive us green?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31675fdea974b657eb7a153239480e23"><gtr:id>31675fdea974b657eb7a153239480e23</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Franz Huber (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_411318665213c5b940</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FEFC28C3-8911-412C-A19E-B67B37E4710C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can motorsport valley drive us green?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31675fdea974b657eb7a153239480e23"><gtr:id>31675fdea974b657eb7a153239480e23</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Franz Huber (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_567975048513c5b896</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-073-27-0031</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-073-27-0031</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
