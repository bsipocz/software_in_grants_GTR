our cells, is frequently damaged. Since the instructions for the proper running of the cell are contained within DNA, damage to this material poses the risk of permanent changes to these instructions, called mutations, that can have an adverse effect on cell behaviour. Mutations are the cause of cancer and other debilitating diseases. Normally, cells quickly realise when DNA has been damaged and they fix it. However, when the level of DNA damage is high or when repair is sub-optimal, the cell can't cope and launches what is known as the DNA damage response. This shuts off normal cell function to give the cell plenty of opportunity to find the damage and greatly increases the capacity to repair it. We are working on two important proteins, ATM and ATR that find DNA damage and initiate the DNA damage response. We are trying to understand how they find the damaged DNA, how they trigger the DNA damage response and what other proteins are involved. In this way, we hope to understand in detail the normal cellular processes that go wrong in cancer and how we might correct them in diseased cells, or prevent them from going wrong in the first place.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Defects in DNA repair or in the ability of cells to slow cell cycle progression after DNA damage can increase cellular mutation rates and cause genome instability leading to variety of debilitating diseases that are accompanied by heightened predispostion to cancer. DNA lesions trigger a highly conserved signal transduction pathway that regulates many aspects of the cellular response to DNA damage and the principal regulators of this pathway are the ATM and ATR protein kinases, critical regulators of genome stability. These kinases rapidly translocate to sites of DNA damage or to stalled DNA replisomes where they are activated by mechanisms that are not yet clear. This causes phosphorylation of a range of proteins including the BRCA1 and p53 tumour suppressors, and the conserved Chk1 and Chk2 protein kinases that when activated by ATM/ATR in turn phosphorylate effectors of cell cycle progression. It is still not known how they carry out many of their cellular functions at the molecular level. For example, it is not clear how ATM and ATR increase cellular DNA repair capacity, how ATR prevents firing of origins of replication when the DNA replication machinery stalls, how these kinases restore chromatin configuration after DNA damage or how they promote recovery from DNA damage. The main goal of my laboratory is to understand how ATM/ATR regulate these processes. We are using several approaches biochemical, genetic and structural - to investigate how ATM/ATR recognise their substrates, what these substrates are, and how these targets contribute to the maintenance of genome stability. We are also using yeast to investigate how, at the molecular level, stalled replisomes bypass replication fork-blocking lesions.We identified several new targets of ATM and ATR and have investigated their cellular functions using budding yeast as a model organism. Phosphorylation of Esc4 by ATR, for example, is essential for the resumption of DNA replication when the DNA replication apparatus stalls at sites of DNA damage. Another new target of ATM and ATR, Slx4, prevents abnormal DNA structures from arising in the vicinity of stalled replication forks. Recently we found that Slx4 is an important regulator of the ability of stalled replisomes to bypass replisome-blocking lesions and we are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms involved. We are currently studying human Slx4-containing complexes and their role(s) in maintenance of genome stability. In mammalian cells we have shown that phosphorylation of the 53BP1 tumour suppressor at Ser25 by ATM caused 53BP1 to physically associate with the hPTIP mediator protein that we identified previously. Interaction of these two proteins is essential for intact responses to DNA damage and we are currently investigating this at the molecular level.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3002000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Loulou Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Determining how mutations in the CDKL5 kinase cause the symptoms associated with CDKL5 deficiency</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3747434-FF29-4A6D-B674-DC5C6774C56C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c32f8cc3f1.63560181-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Loulou Foundation keeps us in contact with other CDKL5 researchers through the CDKL5 Fourm and Portal and with patients and parents</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are studying how CDKL5 mutations affect CDKL5 activity and substrate phosphorylation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>DSTT</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5F58BEE-97B0-4764-82C7-26493A870355</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials. The collaboration led the Unit to develop the technology of protein kinase profiling which has developed into an industry worth over &amp;pound;100 million per annum. It also led to the creation of the European Division of Upstate Incorporated in Dundee which currently employs about 50 people. The Unit's first publication on protein kinase profiling was named in 2009 by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia as Europe's most cited paper in the field of Cel Biology from 1996-2007, with over 2,200 citations.

Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5889e46879b838.01524568-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Boehringer-Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck-Serono - each company pays &amp;pound;600000 per annum over the four year period.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.
