A vast amount has been written about the country house and its owner. Much of it has focused either on consumption as part of wider estate finances (funded through marriage settlements, mortgages and credit, and analysed in terms of income and expenditure) or on luxury goods and the outcomes of consumption - goods as 'art' collections and the country house as the embodiment of social and cultural capital. Little attention has been paid to everyday goods (and their relationship to luxuries) or to the mundane processes of consumption and the systems of supply which met the needs and wants of the elite. \nRather than offer another description of the material culture of the country house, this project engages with several wider debates. The first centres on changing cultures of consumption. Eschewing simple notions of conspicuous consumption or of the elite as connoisseurs, the project will establish how they fitted into wider patterns of consumer behaviour usually examined through the activities of the middling sorts. Second, by focusing on the systems of supply and the processes of acquiring goods, it stresses the everyday practicalities of consumption and the relationship between buyers and sellers, exploring the extent to which 'ordinary' tradesmen were seen as arbiters of taste. Third, it links to debates over the value systems which shaped consumption. At one level, the research explores the interaction between national and local identities: specifically the position of London in structuring and articulating consumption. At another it foregrounds neighbourly, familial and inter-generational relationships, and shows how a better understanding of the disposal as well as the accumulation of goods provides important insights into consumer motivations.\nThese debates are explored through a comparative study of two Warwickshire houses and their owners: Stoneleigh Abbey owned by the Leighs and Alscot Park owned from 1749 by the Wests. By the mid 18th century, both families were very wealthy by county standards and enjoyed national connections as well as considerable local influence. They can be seen as typical of two strands of the provincial gentry: the Leighs were an old-established family, present in Warwickshire from the 16th century; John West came to the county having made his money from trade and politics in London - he was thus arriviste and strongly metropolitan. In their similarities and differences, they afford insights into wider practices and attitudes amongst the provincial elite and consumers in general.\nThe significance of this research stretches far beyond a better knowledge of elite consumption. First, it will revise our understanding of the practices and motivations of consumers during a key period of transformation in domestic material culture and consumerism. In particular, it challenges established theorisations of consumption as primarily an expression of social status, stressing instead the heterogeneity of cultural capital, and the everyday, contingent and relational nature of consumer behaviour. Second, by exploring the ways in which people operated as part of a national and local elite, but also as family members and as individuals with their own tastes and value systems, the research questions the relationship between (social) structures and individual agency. Third, it throws new light on the nature and construction of provincial culture, building on a growing appreciation of the resilience of local identity through the 18th century to challenge the overweening importance accorded to national-metropolitan systems of taste. \nBeyond the realm of academia, the research will provide the wider public with a more nuanced understanding of the workings of the country house, and offer the heritage industry opportunities to present different narratives of the country house as a lived space.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outside the academic community, there are four main beneficiaries of this research: the country houses themselves (Stoneleigh Abbey and Alscot Park); organisations engaged in preserving and presenting country houses (e.g. English Heritage [EH] and the National Trust [NT]); the wider public, particularly those who visit country houses; and family/local historians.\n\nThe research will enhance the presentation and appreciation of our heritage. Specifically, it will benefit Stoneleigh and Alscot by providing: [a] insight into neglected aspects of their history and the ways in which they were linked to local and national networks of people, goods and ideas; and [b] innovative ways of presenting these houses to the visiting public, highlighting the country house as a lived space and as a site of consumption (Objective 9). It will benefit the heritage industry (especially EH and NT) by: [a] exemplifying a new way of presenting the country house: one which links it into the surrounding socio-economic milieu as well as national systems of taste and supply. (This ties into the growing interest in making narratives part of country house visiting and to ideas within the NT on ways of presenting properties as lived spaces); [b] demonstrating how the everyday lives of country house owners can be drawn out, making properties more 'accessible' to the general public - we all shop, negotiate with tradesmen, acquire new things and discard others, and, in doing so, relate to family and neighbours. The visiting public will benefit by being given: [a] interesting new ways of experiencing the country house; [b] a more nuanced understanding of the workings of the country house and the lives of its owners; and perhaps [c] a different perspective on their own consumption practices. \n\nTogether, these benefits have the potential to shift the place of the country house in our national heritage, supplementing an image of aristocratic wealth and power with one in which the elite and their consumption practices form an integral part of wider society, economy and culture.\n\nSome of these benefits will be realised towards the end of the research project; others will accrue over a longer timeframe, perhaps as the approach taken in this project is adopted elsewhere. Indeed, given the professional skills, contacts and knowledge that will be developed through this project, there is huge potential for it to feed into future Knowledge Transfer activity. This might involve further enhancing the presentation of the histories of Alscot and Stoneleigh (Objective 9) or deploying the research model elsewhere (Objective 10), potentially via a KT Fellowship.\n\nThe realisation of these benefits is integral to the dissemination strategy much of which aims at knowledge transfer. Exhibitions held at Stoneleigh and Alscot will demonstrate how the country house can be presented in innovative ways: as a site and product of everyday consumption, and an integral part of local and national networks. The symposium will provide a forum for highlighting the benefits of the approach to be taken here, but also an opportunity for discussing and learning from the different ways in which the country house can be studied and presented. Public lectures and short pieces in 'popular history' magazines will highlight the research undertaken and the ways in which this informs how we might view and present the country house as part of our history and heritage.\n\nThe research databases form a valuable resource. Those containing the names and location of suppliers will be useful to family historians. More generally, all the databases will be useful (to local historians and others) as an overview of the information contained within the archives of Stoneleigh and Alscot, thus opening access to these vast collections to the public. They will be made available in the respective record offices (see T</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Honorable Mary Leigh</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25546B47-1649-405F-8600-F64638D8785E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster exhibition on the life of Mary Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire.

They have also been used, in liaison with the managers and curators at Stoneleigh Abbey and Canons Ashby, to enhance the interpretation of these houses and improve the visitor experience through the provision of a range of new interpretative materials. Some of these have involved the PI directly in producing materials which have impacted on the public (e.g. exhibition and information leaflets at Stoneleigh Abbey); others have involved third parties drawing on the research (e.g. storytelling at Canons Ashby); and others again have been produced by the PI in partnership with experts in other fields (e.g. the guidebook smartphone app for Canons Ashby).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56C5EC6D-C6B3-486B-B94F-BDA0AD82D6AB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54242c70111226.74429363</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has added considerably to our understanding of elite consumption and how this was framed by and impacted upon the country house. Our research on the Leighs of Stoneleigh Abbey, Newdigates of Arbury Hall and Drydens of Canons Ashby has revealed a number of important findings:



1. In contrast with the popular image of spendthrift behaviour, elite spending was often carefully managed to keep it within the bounds of income. Sustained periods of high spending were rare, one of two broad behavioural patterns being adopted. In some families (e.g. Leighs), there were short bursts of conspicuous spending, generally occurring at points of inheritance - a finding which supports Amanda Vickery's argument regarding family cycles and the costs of setting up a household. Other families (Newdigates) spread their spending more evenly, maintaining a relatively steady level of expenditure on long-term projects of building or refurbishment. 



2. The number of children to be provided was an important factor in shaping spending patterns, but more significant was the early death of the owner and periods of trusteeship brought about by minority or mental illness. These limited conspicuous consumption and allowed the estate to be closely managed. These findings support the important, but often overlooked, conclusions arrived at by Peter Roebuck in his study of Yorkshire gentry landowners, and suggest a 'habit' of consumption across elite society not defined by any precise location in the landed order



3. Spending was also moderated by the retention of many older items alongside those newly purchased. This was most evident in terms of furniture and household goods which were often moved around and between houses to accommodate and complement new goods. This was motivated in part by utility and in part by notions of patina, which remained a strong influence on elite cultures of consumption despite the growing importance of novelty. 



4. Elite material culture was shaped by the imperatives of fashion and luxury, but these were tempered by specifically aristocratic concerns for traditional markers of heritance and by the particular tastes, interests and lifestyles of the individual. Whilst these were constrained by the expectations of status and position in society, individual preference was important in interpreting the normalising influence of taste and fashion. Yet elite consumption was also a social activity, shaped by the needs, desires and advice of family and friends.



5. The objects and opulence we associate with the aristocracy did not form the backbone of their consumption habits. Indeed, in most years, the largest proportion of elite expenditure comprised everyday items such as provisions, groceries, cleaning and servants' wages. Such practical considerations form an often-overlooked point of connection between households of rich and poor.



6. The processes and patterns of supply which maintained the country house were complex and variegated. Local towns and villages were important points of supply, even for some luxury goods. Conversely, whilst London dominated in the provision of high-end goods, it metropolitan tradesmen also supplied everyday goods, in part because London was 'local' during the season when the elite took up residence there. Custom was spread widely amongst suppliers, with a relatively small number establishing long-term relationships, usually on the basis of reputation and trust.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has many potential applications outside academia, some of which are already beginning to be put into effect.

1. The research findings offer the study houses insights into what are often neglected aspects of their history. Exploiting these insights can offer new ways of interpreting the house for visitors. This has been put into practice at Stoneleigh Abbey, where leaflet outlining the consumption practices of two owners (Edward and Mary Leigh: Children of Stoneleigh Abbey, 1749-1806) have been distributed to visitors. A poster exhibition on Mary Leigh has also been mounted since 2012 and guides for younger visitors provided in the same year.
At Canons Ashby, the research was mined to provide the basis for Storytelling at the house during the 2012 season. It has also been used to construct a smart phone app which forms an interactive guide to the house.

2. The approach taken by the research offers an innovative way of presenting country houses to the visiting public by emphasising them as lived spaces and sites of consumption. Rather than view the house as a series of set pieces, it might be possible to think of and present it more in terms of the flows of goods and people that moved through the house. This ties into the growing interest in making narratives part of country house visiting and offers the potential to engage visitors in the everyday lives of country house owners by presenting them as consumers who, like us, had to shop negotiate with tradesmen, acquire new things and discard others, and, in doing so, relate to family and neighbours.

3. Specific research on inventories of the house contents offers the potential to reconstruct in detail the contents of particular rooms and to mark changes in fashion and taste over the generations. Perhaps most excitingly, this has formed the basis of a smart phone app which provides an interactive guide to Canons Ashby. Visitors choose which elements of the house to focus on, thus escaping from the necessity of always telling just one story through the presentation of the room/house. 

4. The project also offers the opportunity to bring together academic research and practitioners within the heritage industry, especially those involved in the interpretation and presentation of country houses. This has been put into practice through two mechanisms. First, the project has a dedicated website (http://consumptionandthecountryhouse.ning.com/) which offers a forum through which researchers, practitioners and others can exchange information, ideas and opinions. More formally, there was an international conference, co-sponsored by English Heritage (18-19th April 2012 at the University of Northampton), which brought together academics, curators and historical interpreters to present research findings and interpretative practice. The success of this led to a follow-up conference (15-16th September 2014) which again attracted over 60 delegates from across Europe.

5. Disseminating the research findings provides the opportunity to engage the interest of the wider public, not simply in country houses, but more particularly in the ways in which they might best understand them as dynamic and lived spaces. Bringing to the fore the people who lived and worked in these places, and highlighting the decisions they made about buying and using goods helps to provide a real point of contact between past and present, and between the aristocracy and ordinary people. To this end, the project has sought to disseminate findings through popular history publications (BBC History magazine, July 2011) and talks to various Local History Societies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C2AC7C6E-75EB-4279-ABA3-533FAB6740BA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3522384570.466713777fcfd0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://consumptionandthecountryhouse.ning.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A smartphone app which comprises an interactive guide to Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire.
