It will apply the Innogen Centre's approaches to Adaptive Governance of Innovative Technology (AGIT) and Critical Stakeholder Engagement (CSE) to two case studies on understanding of current regulatory decisions/processes for genetically modified (GM) crops. The project will include consideration of the roles of experts and non-experts in the field, how they use evidence, and how they influence policy decisions.&lt;br />&lt;br />Innogen Centre staff have been closely involved in analysing and commenting on these areas of policy since the early 1990s when there was still considerable uncertainty about the safety of GM crops to people and the environment. The expectation at that time was that the precautionary approach would be modified if and when evidence of the safety and efficacy of GM crops became available. This project will focus on whether and how the regulatory system could become more adaptive to the latest scientific evidence on the safety and benefits of GM crops. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries identified here who will be benefit from this project are based on ESRC, JeS and RCUK guidance on this topic. Beneficiaries will include firms in the agriculture and biotechnology industries; UK, and EU policy stakeholders (including NGOs) in agriculture, environment, and innovation policy; as well as other industries facing regulatory challenges or unknown risk due to emerging technologies.
The goals of the project are directly geared towards providing utility to users, as the main activity of the project goal is to apply and refine the AGIT and CSE approaches to improve evidence based-policy making and analysis, increase public awareness and understanding of science and related economic and social issues, and enhance the performance of industry dealing with regulatory issues and public engagement. 

Regulation in Agricultural Biotechnology and Synthetic biology
The project will have an impact on &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; in the area of agricultural biotechnology by identifying the problems in the regulatory system and risk management processes that may be preventing safe, innovative products from entering the market due to poorly outlined risk management objectives, or social and political concerns based on inaccurate evidence or subjective policy goals. In the long run we hope to inform interventions (via smarter regulatory systems) and behaviour (via smarter regulators). 
It will also help to develop an approach to communicating with stakeholders while being aware of different, potentially conflicting views and goals, and how to navigate these relations. Future resolution of the issues addressed in this project will depend on the interactions between industry, government and civil society, and we will engage with NGOs as part of the project, building on Syngenta's existing good relationships with scientists based at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the British Trust for Ornithology

General AGIT Methodology Impact
The potential impact will go beyond the agricultural biotechnology sector. The approaches refined through this study will help policymakers to see the links between different regulatory structures, and how features of one structure may or may not benefit or restrict innovation because of problematic incentives created for actors interacting with other structures. For example, regulators must consider what implications regulations might have for intellectual property; implications for the cost of development and type of firm best able to develop a product. These implications are important as what may seem like sensible regulations at the present may severely constrain an innovation system in the future. 
Industrial users will improve their ability to understand the governance systems they interact with and determine how to navigate or influence governance structures across a multitude of economic or political settings. Insights into how to treat different sources of evidence, conflicting stakeholder interests, and unforeseen circumstances will enhance user activity directly.

While policymakers and firms will have mechanisms to engage with and improve regulatory systems and governance systems more generally, investors in the life sciences and biotechnology may also potentially benefit from the insights generated by this study regarding how regulatory system issues may impede (or fast track) new products to market. Considering that many new products are stalled, and small companies potentially stifled, by the heavy regulatory burden in the life science industries, such understanding would help investors better determine the probability of success; like firms and policymakers, it would also help investors engage in the creation/improvement of governance systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F31C7B5-6D59-432D-AFCF-2807FB7EF3DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Environmental Regulation of Advanced Innovative Biotechnologies: Anticipating future regulatory oversight</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/100b117b463f2c429eaeae86f8d61698"><gtr:id>100b117b463f2c429eaeae86f8d61698</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tait, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b304beecf9d0.35265303</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5635BA81-BD6E-41E2-9A37-FB86CDAEBD8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards a more open debate about values in decision-making on agricultural biotechnology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transgenic research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09bb41ef90df9df36bc9996e08438352"><gtr:id>09bb41ef90df9df36bc9996e08438352</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Devos Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0962-8819</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdefded290611</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K005642/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3FB490ED-1150-4B72-BB38-E3A211952C34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
