Environment)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/H013644/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We have developed a life cycle perspective inspired conceptual model (CM) that suggests the importance of terrestrial ecosystems as a major repository of ZnO, TiO2, and Ag (Tier 1) manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) introduced via the land application of MNM-containing biosolids. We propose to investigate the transport, fate, behavior, bioavailability, and effects of MNMs in(to) agroecosystems under environmentally realistic scenarios organized around three key hypotheses: Hypothesis (H1) Surface chemistry is the primary factor influencing the fate and transport of MNMs in the terrestrial environment as well as the bioavailability and effects to biological receptors; Hypothesis (H2) Once released to the environment, pristine MNM surfaces will be modified by interactions with organic and inorganic ligands (macromolecules) or via other biogeochemical transformations (aging effects forming a-MNMs); Hypothesis (H3) Ecoreceptors will respond to interactions with pristine metal and metal oxide MNMs, a-MNMs, and/or dissolved constituent metal ions and bulk oxides by specific ecological and toxicogenomic responses that will reflect their combined effects. Experimental Approach: Detailed physicochemical characterization will be conducted on Tier 1 and Tier 2 (CeO2, carbon nanotubes) MNMs and a-MNMs produced by simulating aging and these materials will be utilized in column transport (Tier 1 and 2), bioavailability, and effects (Tier 1) studies to key ecoreceptors (bacteria, soil invertebrates, and plants). Data needed to calibrate and validate the pBRM will be collected for Tier 1 MNMs using a subset of ecoreceptor species. The CM and model results from the simulated aging of MNMs will then be validated by repeating studies of Tier 1 MNMs subjected to actual WWTP using a pilot scale WWT facility. To facilitate these and future investigations of MNMs under environmentally relevant scenarios, novel in situ tools will be developed. Expected Results: The proposed research will generate among the first data on the transformations of important classes of MNMs subjected to WWTP as well as those added to and aged in soil. These data will be critical for evaluating potential direct and indirect ecological and human health risks of MNMs introduced to agroecosystems. Data generated on the simulated aged materials and on the MNM containing biosolids and soils to test H1 &amp;amp; H2, may indicate that the permutations of MNM properties required to be experimentally considered under realistic environmental scenarios can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, the results of this work will provide the first validation of using gene and protein expression profiles generated in laboratory controlled experiments as an indicator of exposure or effects under environmentally realistic conditions. An important output from the proposed research and modeling efforts will be the development of first generation validated predictive models of the environmental fate, behavior, bioavailability, and effects of several important classes of MNMs in agroecosystems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204924</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Kentucky</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Plant and Soil Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>TINE collaborators</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E5F4852-4115-44D6-9840-6C3CB49C7127</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications:

Biosolids are produced during the treatment (purification) of raw sewage from homes, factories and other places such as offices and hospitals. This treatment is needed to make the wastewater suitable to be discharged into rivers, but the biosolids produced need to be disposed of. One way of doing this is to spread the biosolids on agricultural land, where they gradually break down and release useful nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil. However, biosolids also accumulate other chemicals from the wastewater. These can include nanoparticles such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide and silver. These nanoparticles may come from factories, for example factories making nanoparticles. They can also come from the home, as nanoparticles may be used in products such as suntan lotions (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) and socks (silver), or from hospitals (silver nanoparticles may be used, for example, in wound dressings). Land spreading of biosolids containing nanoparticles may cause them to accumulate in the soil over time, if the biosolids are spread to the same land many times over. Eventually, this might cause the health of the soil to decline, for example by affecting the bacteria, plants and animals that live in the soil. Regulations exist on the accumulation in soils of some metals, such as zinc, from biosolids spreading, and currently these regulations also include accumulation of the metal in nanoparticles. However, because the metal nanoparticles are chemically different from other forms of metals going into wastewater treatment plants, it is possible that they pose different risks to the other forms of metals. Because the use of nanoparticles is increasing rapidly, it is important to assess their risks to soil health. 
We assessed the risks of zinc oxide, silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles to biosolids by firstly making mixtures of an agricultural soil with biosolids that were produced by adding the nanoparticles to the inflow of a sewage treatment works. For comparison we also made two other sets of mixtures: mixtures produced using normal (salt) forms of zinc and silver and a non-nanoparticle form of titanium dioxide (titanium does not dissolve in water so we could not use a salt form for the comparison), and mixtures using biosolids produced without adding any metals or nanoparticles. We placed earthworms in the mixtures for eight weeks and measured their survival, their reproduction rates and the amounts of silver, zinc and titanium in their tissues at the end of the test. We also measured the concentrations of zinc and silver in water samples extracted from the mixtures at the end of the test.
The earthworms reproduced less in the mixtures containing either the metal nanoparticles or salt/bulk metals, compared to the mixture with no added nanoparticles or metals. However, the earthworms reproduced less in the mixture containing nanoparticles than they did in the mixture containing salt/bulk metals, even though the concentrations of metals in both mixtures were similar. The earthworms did not appear to take up titanium from the mixtures, suggesting that titanium dioxide was not having an effect on them. The earthworms also accumulated more silver from the mixture containing nanoparticles than they did from the mixture containing salt/bulk metals. The earthworms accumulated similar amounts of zinc from both the mixtures, which appeared to be due to their ability to control the amount of zinc in their tissues. The concentrations of silver and zinc in the extracted waters were similar for both mixtures. This suggests that the actual forms of silver and zinc in the two types of mixture are similar. This was also suggested by measurements on the biosolids, made by our collaborators in TINE, which showed that the chemical forms of silver and zinc in both types of biosolid were similar. Therefore, it is not clear why the earthworms are affected more in the mixtures made with biosolids containing nanoparticles. We are hypothesising that there are differences in the physical form of the zinc and/or the silver in the mixtures that result in the differences in effects on the earthworms, although more research is needed to investigate this further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results suggest that regulations on the amounts of metals allowed in agricultural soils after biosolids spreading may not be strict enough for biosolids that contain zinc and/or silver that have been derived from nanoparticles. Therefore, they have potentially important implications for stakeholders concerned with the management of the risks of biosolids spreading on land. These stakeholders will include policymakers concerned with setting regulations, and regulators concerned with implanting such regulations. These results could be taken forward by such stakeholders to assess whether current regulations and/or practice in biosolids spreading require amendment to account for the possible presence of nanoparticle-derived metals in such biosolids.
There is also a scientific need to build upon these findings. Firstly, there is a need to better establish whether or not both silver and zinc are making significant contributions to the observed effects, in order to focus future research efforts. Secondly, there is a need to better understand the mechanisms behind the effects. For example, are there significant differences in the physical or chemical forms of silver and zinc in biosolids, depending on whether they enter the sewage treatment system as nanoparticles or in other forms? Do any such differences influence the uptake of silver and/or zinc by earthworms, and do they influence the degree of effect seen as a result of uptake? Finally, do these findings also apply to other key components of soil ecosystems, such as microbial communities, thus suggesting a generally higher hazard due to metals in nanoparticulate form in biosolids? Therefore, there is considerable potential for these results to be used a starting point by researchers in nanoparticle physicochemistry and ecotoxicity to further develop understanding of the causes and extent of ecological effects due to silver and zinc in biosolids that have been derived from nanoparticles. Such research may ultimately feed into assessment and/or amendment of regulations concerning the spreading of biosolids to land.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0A44305E-8096-449B-B120-1E65E6AA5B70</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5b43b152eb9.09705319</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a dataset of soil physicochemistry, metal concentrations (in soil and soil porewater) and associated effects measures for earthworms.
