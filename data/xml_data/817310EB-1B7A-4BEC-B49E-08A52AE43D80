These compounds may arise from natural sources (e.g. plant extracts) or be the products, desired or otherwise, of a chemical reaction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the key techniques available to perform this identification in the solution state. Unfortunately, NMR spectroscopy is an inherently insensitive technique due to the weak interaction of nuclear spins with an applied magnetic field. This provides a lower limit on the amount of sample required to obtain quality spectroscopic data in a reasonable time frame. 

This proposal will apply a photochemical nuclear hyperpolarisation method which is capable of increasing the sensitivity of an NMR experiment by over 10-fold under favourable conditions thereby improving the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy for structure elucidation. This method relies on a spin-state selective photochemical reaction between a photosensitiser dye molecule and the compound of interest. This reaction generates a spin-correlated radical pair, where the overall spin state is well defined. After undergoing coherent oscillation between singlet and triplet states, recombination of the radical pair via the singlet channel results in significant non-Boltzmann spin population in the products, which is detected an a large signal enhancement in the NMR spectrum. 

This proposal will develop a low-cost illumination device, based on high current light emitting diode arrays, in order to generate photochemical nuclear hyperpolarisation. This will then be used to develop photochemically-enhanced NMR experiments for small molecule structure elucidation. Initial focus will be on H-X correlation experiments through both one and multiple bonds. These experiments allow the atomic connectivities to be determined using less material than currently achievable. Modern approaches such non-uniform sampling will be employed to optimise the data acquisition along wit extensions to time-shared acquisition in which multiple heteronuclear correlation experiments are acquired in a single experiment. Ultimately, determination of the carbon-carbon connectivities is required to define the configuration of a molecule. Most modern experiments obtain this information indirectly via mutual correlations with hydrogen atoms. An experiment, known by the acronym INADEQUATE provides the carbon-carbon connectivities directly. Despite being proposed over 30 years ago, it has not found wide spread use due to being extremely insensitive as it detects the less than 0.01% of molecules which contain two adjacent carbon-13 atoms. The final part of this proposal will be to &amp;quot;rehabilitate&amp;quot; the INADEQUATE experiment by using photochemical enhancement and enabling its more routine use in the toolbox of NMR spectroscopic experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Determining the atomic connectivity of a newly synthesised or extract molecule is a key step in allowing a chemistry project to progress. NMR spectroscopy is the principal analytical tool used in this endeavour, however, it is limited by inherently low sensitivity. The use of a convenient and simple hyperpolarisation method would therefore greatly benefit those undertaking molecular structure elucidation and determination both in academia and industry. The PI has links with a number of NMR spectroscopists across academia and industry and these links will be exploited to further increase the impact of the project. The illumination device will be compact, and form an accessory suitable for any NMR spectrometer. Therefore discussions with both instrument vendors will be undertaken as the project develops. With renewed interested in low-field bench-top NMR systems the scope for interaction with the spectrometer vendors is further increased. One of the key disadvantages of low-field systems is the much lower sensitivity compared to high-field spectrometers. Hence discussions with the key vendors in this area will be a priority. Links with industrial partners will be explored through the PI and Co-I's contacts in their respective fields, in conjunction with the university's Research and Enterprise office, Sussex IP and the Sussex Innovation Centre. 

The major results will be published in leading high-impact journals, read by a variety of potential beneficiaries along with the more technical aspects being published in detail in more specialist journals. The methods developed and results obtained will be presented at national and international conferences both by the PI, PDRA and other members of the PI's research group, attended by both academic and industrial colleagues with a keen interest in both NMR methodology and structure elucidation of challenging molecules. Wider, non-specialist audiences will be engaged through the schools outreach activities, such as Schools Experience Days and an annual Teachers' Symposium, undertaken within the department, and as talks and demonstrations within the further outreach work of the School.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>432715</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P015735/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
