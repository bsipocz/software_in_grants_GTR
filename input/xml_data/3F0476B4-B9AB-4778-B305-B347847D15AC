I develop an original argument that each of these works-the Pr&amp;eacute;lude &amp;agrave; l'apr&amp;egrave;s-midi d'un faune; the Chansons de Bilitis; and the Trois Nocturnes-offers, in its own terms, an intricate allegory of the experience of writing and listening to music 'after Wagner', as Debussy himself later put it. In other words, I argue that the very interplay of orchestral sounds in the Pr&amp;eacute;lude, the miniature 'drama' of piano-vocal interaction in the Chansons, and the intricately interwoven games with rhythm, meter, phrasing and memory in the Nocturnes each articulate a distinct, prophetic statement about the 'modern' musical culture that was then coming into view across the threshold between two centuries.\n Building out from this narrow, specialist foundation, my Fellowship research will then look forward through several distinct phases of reception for each of these three musical allegories. This second stage of the study has a double aim. Most simply, it aims to trace the evolution of a modern culture of listening through selected reference to several media of reception-dance; film; analysis; recordings-as well as telling inter-artistic parallels (e.g. in contemporary painting and literature). But at the end of this variegated history, I also aim to look back and assess just how much relevance each of those initial musical allegories can be said to retain in our contemporary culture. \n The project aims to deliver, as one primary output, a scholarly monograph that balances detailed allegorical interpretation with issues of reception, all framed within recent theoretical writing on the idea and history of 'modernism'. But in addition, the approaching Debussy sesquicentenary in 2012 will offer an ideal opportunity to extract central themes for disseminatthrough public concerts, lectures, and symposia which will invite a wide audience to reflect both on the specific issues raised in each allegory, and on the wider, underlying questions about the cultural value of 'modernist' art and music. Given that my allegorical interpretations bring to light confrontations with such perennial human concerns as the split between intellectual and sensuous experience, the artistic representation of various cultural 'others', and the affective seductions of militant patriotism, these public events are sure to prove vivid illustrations of the power of 'art' music to contribute to our thinking on a range of pressing cultural and political concerns.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although my primary target audience is the world of music researchers and students, the project's potential long-range field of impact would include the full range of performers, concert administrators, broadcasters and commentators involved in the transmission of art music both to live audiences and through all the mediated channels of contemporary musical culture. In the long run, my analytical perspectives could directly influence both performers and record producers, as well as, for example, the radio broadcasters who transmit (and critically assess) recordings of this and related music; the authors of program notes that frame the cultural and historical importance of such music for a broader audience; film makers and film critics interested in questions raised by the appropriation of classical or 'art' music in film scoring.\nIn the shorter term, my targeted completion date for the monograph I see as one main output of this Fellowship perfectly positions this research as the foundation for several public events during the sesquicentenary year of Debussy's birth in 2012. In particular, I plan:\n- a concert under the aegis of 'Music in the University' on 'Musical Representations of the Other', which will present the Chansons de Bilitis alongside Ravel's Chansons Mad&amp;eacute;casses (1925-26) as double inspiration for range of new works commissioned to confront present-day instantiations of similar concerns. \n- a pre-concert talk that introduces symphony orchestra audiences to my 'topical' and 'poetic' reading of the Nocturnes, and presents the fractious background context of the Dreyfus Affair as a way to stimulate thought on music and politics; \n- a lecture-screening that exemplifies various dance and film adaptations of the Pr&amp;eacute;lude &amp;agrave; l'apr&amp;egrave;s-midi d'un faune. \nI also have further, longer-range plans for radio broadcasts that compare performances of Debussy's music over history, considering questions both of a musical and a practical/technological nature.\n\nAll thof these ideas hold rich promise for deepening the interdisciplinary contacts that are currenly in the process of being strengthened by Glasgow University's 'restructuring' of its Faculties: the Music department is to form a 'school' with the departments of History of Art and Theatre, Film and Television Studies. Collectively, all these possible events or activities offer rich opportunities to demonstrate how such an interdisciplinary musicological research project can serve to deepen understanding of the creation, transmission, reproduction and performance of cultural 'identities' (see the AHRC's 'Leading the World' document, p. 17).\n\nI would note, finally, that the research pursued during this Fellowship is sure to accumulate much material (and open further questions) beyond what can be feasibly addressed in a single monograph. I can foresee my investigations into the use of Debussy's music in film, for example, and in the questions of interpretation and production I will pursue through comparative studies of recordings, as topics highly likely to deliver raw materials suitable to be elaborated in peer-reviewed articles over several months after the Fellowship is completed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at public symposium (Gresham College, London), 'Debussy: Text and Idea'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>77D6EED1-D528-47F5-A600-C9B0C7269446</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk, on a study session that was fully booked, sparked considerable discussion afterwards, and a video (with supporting documents) was subsequently posted on line at the Gresham College website.

There followed a concert of works commissioned to address the theme of 'Envoicing the Other' (as exemplified by Debussy's Chansons de Bilitis and Ravel's Chansons Mad&amp;eacute;casses), which included works by composers based in London and Liverpool as well as by local Glasgow composers. Discussion following the papers and symposium was lively, the concert well attended and appreciated by a varied public.

The Concert featured newly-composed works by several UK composers, which would later have been included in research portfolios.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546383ffc3a314.12839780</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/cca/research/music/projectsandnetworks/envoicingtheother/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote talk at an International Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>640BE0CE-5D5C-4B66-B162-A1D6A9E6F431</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussions; while in Montreal I contributed an interview on the subject of Debussy's music; the paper formed the basis of an article due to be re-published in a volume for Rochester U Press.
