In the first instance this will predominantly be related to work on risk and uncertainty within the NERC Natural Hazards theme. The position will allow for an active researcher to promote knowledge exchange with the financial services sector, whilst remaining based in her research group. The position is to be embedded in the NERC Knowledge Exchange Strategy and the fellow will work closely with Professor John Rees (Theme Leader for Natural Hazards) and the NERC Knowledge Exchange Team.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In section 7 we have discussed the problems caused by a lack of suitable tools and approaches to the handling of uncertainty and risk which have had a large impact in natural hazard risk assessments. This has arisen because of cultural divides within the natural hazard community between providers and users of uncertainty and risk research. The lack of cross-sectional communication has resulted in each science area and sector developing its own concepts and methodologies in isolation. Furthermore, the lack of interdisciplinary research has meant that new techniques and tools from statistics and related fields have not been systematically incorporated into risk assessment models. 
As natural hazards can be extremely damaging, and every country can be affected, even small advances in risk management have a huge potential to bring substantial and highly visible benefits. This ultimately translates into a reduction in lives lost and financial losses incurred by individuals, states and insurance companies. For example, in 2009 there were 860 loss events due to natural hazards recorded world wide with a total economic loss of US$59 billion and 11,000 fatalities (Munich Re 2010). The most expensive losses in Europe in 2009 were Winter Storm Klaus which cost the insurance industry US$3 billion. 2010 is set to be one of the costliest years on record with the Haiti earthquake alone totalling between US$8-14bn in economic losses and 220,000 fatalities. 
In the UK, the biggest threat comes from river flooding and flash floods with windstorms a close second. The financial effects of flooding can be significant; for example, the Association of British Insurers has put the average cost of flood damage to homes at between &amp;pound;20,000 and &amp;pound;40,000 (November 2009). The 2007 floods across Yorkshire, the Midlands and the West of England cost insurers over &amp;pound;3 billion. The 2009 floods in Cumbria, West Wales, and Dumfries and Galloway, although on a smaller scale still cost insurers over.5m. The Association of British Insurers predict that with a 4oC rise in global temperatures, the average insured losses in the UK from river flooding and flash floods could rise by 14% to &amp;pound;633 million by 2060 and windstorm damage by 25% to &amp;pound;827 million each year. 
Between 1960 and 2000, disasters caused by natural hazards worldwide more than tripled and economic losses increased more than eight fold yet the death toll was cut in half (Munich Re 2000). The rise in economic loss over this period is due to rapid and poorly controlled urbanisation, ineffective public policy and increasing construction in hazard prone areas as well as variations in climate (World Disasters Report 2004). On average, the economic loss in developed countries is around US$318 million per event. This is more than 11 times higher than comparable events in third world countries. However, this does not reflect the impact that these events have on the gross domestic product of poorer countries; for example, 300 people die per disaster in poor countries as opposed to 44 people in the developed world. 
In the 20th Century 275,000 people on average have died per year because of natural hazards. There was no significant increase in death rates due to natural hazards over this period. This suggests that decades of international technical assistance, which gave priority attention to disaster rescue and relief and also to improvements in weather forecasting balanced population increases. This provides clear evidence on how a scientifically integrated cross-disciplinary approach significantly reduced fatalities due to natural hazards. It is felt that if a similar approach were taken to reduce economic losses concentrating on improving communication between researchers from a variety of disciplines and risk managers, this would result in improvements in our ability to quantify uncertainty and risk, ultimately leading to better risk management and therefore a reduction in economic losses in the long rm.

1. Willis Research Network - key members: Douglas Rowan, Matt Foote and Trisha Holly- Davies: Several discussions and meeting have been held with this group. They were very interested in being part of PURE KE network and have since been involved chiefly through supporting some of the consortium bids. Also discussed NERC data issues with how data is tagged follow up discussion with Mark Thorley about how we can improve our data services. I have received several Invitations workshop meetings and conference both in London and at EGU. Made contact with academics involved with the Willis Research Network in order to ensure that NERC achieved a high quality of consortium grant applications for PURE (this was achieved as both grants received where funded).
2. KTNs - Developed strong working relationship with the Financial services KTN and the industrial mathematics KTN. Dickie Whitaker was able to get me access to all the major insurance companies in the City - Lloyds, Willis, AON Benfield, Guy Carpenter we have been able to use these contacts to test out various ideas about how the PURE experimental portal should be developed and understand what the key developments needs are for Cat models in the insurance industry. This has enabled us to develop the first and second phase of the PURE experimental portal in close collaboration with the stakeholder community. Because of this consultation we changed our initial ideas for the portal and have now focused on cataloguing models, providing access to model linkage platforms and frameworks, and concentrating on niche hazards or areas - in other words in areas where the insurance community know there could be a problem but economically it's not viable for them to develop models. These neche areas are often areas of interest to academic researchers and by providing access to where these models are located will increase the impact of NERC research both in terms of economic (within the financial sector) but also in a humanitarian front too. Secondly I have worked very closely with the industrial maths KTN. For example I worked with NERC to help setup their contract to run the PURE network and since, working with the IM-KTN to setup and prioritise workshops and events under the PURE programme banner such as the PURE health event, PURE brokerage event, PURE associate calls, LWEC sessions, Lloyds Risk Prize to name just a few examples. As well as providing invaluable advice during my fellowship, we now use the KTNs much more extensively within BGS to help with developing relationships with external stakeholders. 
3. I met Eddie Moreland and Derek Morgan from the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) back in 2011. Deal with Risk from the disaster/ accident side of the business. Have considerable expertise in societal and environmental risk and its impact. Originally they were interested in being involved with the PURE network. Since then I realised that the work that BGS are doing with hazard susceptibility could be enhanced with their national population database currently being scoped are a couple of information products that will use this data and through closer links with BGS they are also now co-chair (Helen of the NHP Hazard Impact model work package
4. Uncertainweb (FP7 project) Secured access to the uncertweb suite of tools for either direct use within our own experimental zone or to develop to suit our needs. The Aston University uncertweb team did start to look at making their tools OpenMI compliant for use within our experimental portal.
5. Loughborough University : John Hillier at Loughborough University to come down and give 'an intelligent dummies guide to Catastrophe modelling'
6. Natural Hazard Partnership and the Met office: Met with Sophie Purdey and Paul Davies. Paul Davies is in charge of the Natural Hazards Partnership. We have managed to get the Met office to talk about different approaches to modelling and not just to encode everything into the unified model. Going forward I have a meeting in June 2014 with Julia Slingo to talk to her about developing closer links with BGS particularly in the fields of coupled process modelling.
7. North Atlantic Geological Surveys (NAGS): Presented work at the NAG annual Directors meeting and have interested them in looking at linked models in their new Urban Cities project. we have generated some interest in this 
8. OGC : Open Geospatial consortium (24th to 26th September) in Rome to discuss on a more international front how we should provide access to models via web services and develop modelling linking protocols. The Open Geospatial consortium have been helping with work towards making OpenMI and international standard and they have provided support and advice about how to better implement OpenMI in the future. 
9. Satellite Applications Catapult: spoke with Nick Veck. Discussions around CEMS and virtualisation technologies which could be used within the PURE experimental zone. They also have a visualisation suite which has a variety of visualisation systems such as touch-tables to a video-wall. We have discussed working with them and Reading University on a joint project on groundwater flooding and its impacts on the sewage network. Although this proposal was not successful we are continuing to work with them and developing further grant applications
10. GeoSeren: Dr Wyn Cudlip discussion on the application of modelling to help farmers fertilise there soil more efficiency. This was about how we should be delivering our modelled output in terms of the PURE experimental zone. Agri-food and soil geochemistry could be a massive area for BGS going forward so I have initiated our Product Development GeoProperties team and environmental statistics teams to build on current contacts such as GeoSeren and develop this area going forward.
11. Mark Fermor: ESI discussion of working on flood modelling as a joint venture. Discussions still ongoing could produce better models going forward. This has resulted in ESI licensing BGS data on flooding and developing a product that BGS now receive revenue from. 
12. NASA and EPA (USA): during 2013-14 we have been discussing with NASA and EPA; contacts e.g. Gary Geller, Stefano Nativi, Michael Seablom, Deana Pennington and Vanessa Ecobar, how we can do more joint working. We have had four teleconferences and we are trying to set up a couple of join projects looking at model linkage and join up the USA with the UK in terms of technology being used. It is still early days but the potential is very exciting for the PURE experimental zone going forward the major stumbling block at the moment is funding and this is really what is delaying more progress being made.

Legacy of fellowship 
External 
1. Clearer understanding of what BGS and NERC offer in terms of hazard and risk research.
2. The joining up of several academic institutions together particularly smaller institutions that are doing specialist work e.g. Loughborough university
3. The PURE knowledge exchange network has started to bring together different communities such as health, mathematicians and geosciences and this will continue as the programme gains pace
Internally 
1. BGS has gained a better understanding of what the financial sector are interested in, in terms of environmental modelling research and the development of information products. 
2. BGS now routinely make use of the KTN's particularly in the product development part of the organisation to develop workshops and networking events with external stakeholders in communities we haven't traditionally worked with
3. Academic and business contacts have been strengthen with new collaborations with for example the HSL, Cranfield, UCL and Bristol universities. 
4. BGS has engaged with the Lloyds risk prize event and the financial services data fair with some success. Last 2012 we had two papers that were category winners, really demonstrating the improved impact that BGS can achieve when engaging with these sorts of events. 
5. BGS and NERC now have a greater awareness of how the financial sector use our digital data holdings and the issues behind using 'scientifically correct' terminology which isn't understood in the financial sector and the issue of making our data more easily available and more visible so that its simpler to find information without the need to go through several websites
Personally 
1. Gained in confidence about networking and am a lot clearer about how to develop contacts with business and use contacts more effectively 
2. I have developed a greater understanding about how models are used in the insurance industry and how the industry works. This has enabled me to advise colleagues on how to go about developing new information products such as the BGS new GeoSure Insurance Product and to some extent event new KE fellows who are just starting out. 
3. My success in gaining my current position in BGS as science director for environmental modelling, appointed in Feb 2013. Has come out of my ability to network, understanding of the uses of environmental modelling for stakeholders and an understanding of coupled modelling techniques.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>79EBFB1A-1C4C-4DA2-A240-A3EF1AB3B0AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544f62e1697b78.49491421</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange Fellow for the PURE programme 

Main objectives of my fellowship was: The fellowships main objective was to support the initiation of the PURE programme and to help publicise its objectives so that once the programme's research consortiums where up and running the programme was able to generate impact straight from the start. My role has also been to work with the IM KTN to forge closer links between the financial sector and the UK research community and help with the setting up of the PURE. Below I have put together a summary of the types of activities carried out for each of the main objectives outlined in the KE grant proposal 

1. To improve communication and networking between researchers and risk managers within the financial services sector 
a. Spent time in the city getting to know and understand the insurance industry and catastrophe modelling companies. Had meetings with 15 different companies, which included insurers, reinsurers, and cat modelling companies. Worked with the Lighthill network and Willis Research Network to understand how academics could better interact with the sector
b. Development of the PURE network - the network has been setup by the Industrial maths KTN. I have worked with the director of the network to help prioritise events, and bring people together.
c. Open MI association meeting in the city: as part of Water Framework Directive a model integration standard (OpenMI) was setup along with its implementation platform (fluidearth). Model linkage offers an alternative solution to generating large complex cat models as it allows for the developer to use a more componentised approach. I setup a meeting in the city for the association to meet the financial sector and to learn from then how OpenMI should be developed to meet the needs of this sector
d. PURE Brokerage event 
This event was put on to announce the funding opportunities available under the PURE programme and to bring academics together. My role was to publicise the PURE experimental Portal, to network within the academic community to encourage people to attend and finally to encourage and publicise the event in the financial sector
e. PURE Experimental Portal Launch 
Launched phase 1 of the experimental portal in Lloyds of London on the 27th September 2012. 
f. LWEC : PURE breakout Session 
Hosted a workshop at the LWEC event 'supporting the journey to adaption' on the 13th November 2012
g. Various Conferences to present PURE programme and Portal
Throughout my fellowship I have attended several conferences to promote the PURE programme and gather external interest in the PURE Experimental Portal. For example 
EGU (both oral and poster sessions), GeolSoc meeting on Model Fusion, Planet under Pressure (this generated a lot of interest making several new contacts and reaffirming others), the Credible consortium programme meetings, specialist meetings run by Willis and LightHill, LWEC meetings etc. 

2. To provide a platform for the dissemination of information on uncertainty and risk analysis between a range of researchers and practitioners 
For phase one of the development of the Pure Experimental zone, we were tasked by the PURE board to produce a pilot experimental zone. We were to use OpenMI to enable data and model sharing within a secure environment and test the feasibility of the zone for at least one hazard type. To test the feasibility of using OpenMI in the experimental zone we selected groundwater flooding. A prototype of a linked CAT model was successfully developed by connecting a groundwater flow model with components from a CAT model to prove the concept of coupling environmental process-based models with economical models using OpenMI. The model comprises of 7 components namely, a regional ZOOM groundwater flow model, flood depth model, groundwater flood event database generating model, groundwater flooding hazard map model, groundwater flooding vulnerability model, groundwater flooding exposure model, and the groundwater flooding loss estimating model. The PURE experimental zone pilot can be found at http://pureexperimentalzone.org. The experimental zone platform provides users with access to the following facilities: the groundwater catastrophe model as a set of 7 linkable components, a simple 3 component abstraction well model, Pipistrelle (an application developed by HR Wallingford to help modellers create and run model compositions/ workflows), tutorials on how to make models open MI compliant and how to use Pipistrelle, a set of links to related hazard and uncertainty programmes, a facility for sharing OpenMI compliant models and finally information on 2 user cases. Phase 2 of the portal has been scoped and the project is now underway it has 3 key objectives:
1. To ensure that risk and natural hazard models are available for use by providing a simple online catalogue facility 
2. Provide access to open access workflow management systems such as gUSE and SHIWA and model linking frameworks such as OpenMI
3. Provide access to a group of simple exemplars that demonstrate the applicability and establishing the credibility of IEM techniques in the assessment of hazard and risk for natural hazards

3. To generate a portfolio of best practice in uncertainty and risk analysis 
This part of the objectives of the project was taken over by the EA and the PURE Knowledge Exchange Network. We have and will be developing a catalogue of models that will available through the work being developed for phase two of the portal. For example the uncertainweb material will be available as will be the best practise tool kit being developed on sensitivity analysis for example by CREDIBLE etc. 
4. To act as a focal point between the financial sector and natural hazard research in NERC 
Invited to submit an abstract to the geolsoc model fusion conference in 2012 and were also asked to present PURE work to the NAGS group (North Atlantic geological Surveys) directors meeting October 2012. Ran the NERC centres and survey Integrated Environmental Modelling workshop which brought together the whole of NERC to discuss how we improve our working relationships and how we develop better ways to link environmental models together. A meeting report has been written and circulated to all the members of the group. The reports outlines how NERC should develop IEM going forward and provided an ideal networking opportunity for NERC and its centre and surveys to discuss modelling uncertainty. Was invited down by Oliver Wyman to give a talk on the impact of technology on the future of underwriting. The group had several underwriters there e.g. Travelers, Towergate, Allianz. This fed into a report that they produced on new technology and its impact which NERC was credited as a contributor for.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. The insurance sector has the money to pay for the research that they need. NERC should maintain a close relationship with them but NERC do not need to subsidise their research for them. Our engagement with them through PURE and the KE fellowship has shown that they are interested in new research and NERC support of events such as the Lloyds risk prize is a good way of getting NERC science out there. Contact by NERC's KE department and myself with the FS-KTN and the Lighthill Risk Network I feel provided the impetus for Lighthill to setup the first data-fair meeting at Lloyds in 2011 this meeting is now called the Insurance Modelling and data Expose (IMDE) and is an excellent vehicle for maintaining contacts with them and highlighting recent scientific advances for NERC funded science. NERC should now focus on other priority areas which are in poorer sectors of the market where our support could make a much bigger impact. 
2. Insurance companies are mostly interested in the likelihood of a catastrophic event happening next year. This is due to the fact that they price up policies a year ahead. Therefore since climate change is a gradual process in their eyes this isn't a priority concern to them. Any research that is focused on being of interest to the insurance sector needs to make an impact on yearly insurance costs or improving their understanding of and mitigating against the 1 in 200 year event (as required by the new solvency II legislation)
3. The value of NERC data is difficult to determine by the financial sector because they find it difficult to get hold of. NERC need to be clearer on what it does and develop a single point of contact for all its data. The financial sector value data access over quality 
4. We can gain greater impact from our research if we align our KE with our research programmes so that they work alongside each other. To maximise impact and knowledge transfer we need to, understand from the get go, what it is our stakeholders want 
5. Internships are a great way for foster collaboration but particularly in the financial sector there was far too much paper work for what were to them small sums of money.
6. The city work very much on personalities, this may seem odd in today's society but for them they want to see you face to face and they want to feel they can trust you to deliver. 
7. The financial sector looks up research often by using search engines such as Google. They won't be buying nature so if you need to get your research noticed it needs to be searchable via Google. They do care about individuals peer review record and in some cases institutions as well but still the research has to be readily available. More publication of NORA for example could help raise the profile of NERC research outputs.

In terms of the PURE experimental Portal 

Our original vision was that, the experimental zone would contain a 'library' of models and data-sources that can be linked together into a fused model (or 'composition') via a version of the Pipistrelle interface. It was hoped that we would be able to lower the boundaries to linking models by developing a web-based interface; making it easy to add, remove, or swap model components and run compositions remotely. An additional aim for the experimental zone is also to encourage the flow of information between scientists and end-users in a much more interactive way thereby speeding up the dissemination of information to a larger user community, widening the opportunity to evaluate simulations and model outputs from a variety of different community perspectives. However having completed phase one of the study it is clear that although theoretically the technology and infrastructure exist in practise there are still many challenges to making this a reality:

1. Model interfaces and deployments are complicated and variable and not designed to integrate together. Overriding issue is that models are generally not written for the web and exposing models to the web is time consuming and for most modellers there is no incentive to do this. 
2. There is no standard for model integration, OpenMI is one of several and has yet to gain OGC accreditation. Standardising the inputs and outputs of models may provide a simpler solution along with a mechanism for scripting workflows however it should be noted that this is not a trivial undertaking and would need long term support 
3. OpenMI is a fantastic tool but there are limitations. For example it can only wrap a limited number of programming languages. Although there is no reason why this couldn't be extended in theory, it should be appreciated that a significant amount of development time would be required to do this. Furthermore Pipistrelle, (the application which allows you to setup workflows and run them) is not web-enabled and my understanding from discussions with HR Wallingford is that it would be very challenging to achieve this. Finally the issue of security and operating an open and closed system within the PURE experimental zone. This was a key requirement on the original specification for the PURE experimental zone and again although theoretically possible no one in the OpenMI community has done this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2D8ECCFF-5A40-4B3D-BDA9-AC9BD63D64B9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f636a0a8f64.66859244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management
