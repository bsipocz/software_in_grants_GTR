&lt;p>Academic research carried out by the PI investigated how people construct, negotiate or resist empathy with others through dialogue and interaction. Application to post-conflict reconciliation in N Ireland and to conflict transformation interventions in Kenya showed the potential of the research to contribute to the field of conflict transformation. The current project aims to realise that contribution by working with conflict transformation experts and practitioners, and parties to conflict.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In its first phase, the project brings together a network of academics and conflict transformation experts to produce a shared framework that maps models of conflict transformation processes against previous research findings, to be called the 'Empathy in Conflict Map'. The second phase will operationalise the Empathy in Conflict Map through collaborative work in Kenya (post-conflict) and Nepal (settlement phase of conflict) to collect stories of conflict transformation through interviews and collaboratively develop methods for analysing empathy dynamics. In the third, dissemination phase, findings will be incorporated into training materials and activities for wider dissemination.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The project partner will benefit from engagement with the research to focus explicitly on empathy dynamics in their ongoing work. They already acknowledge the importance of empathy in their conflict transformation practice, and, from their knowledge of the PI's research in the Living with Uncertainty project are convinced of its value for further collaborative development.
As a knowledge exchange project, the proposed activities 1-7 have been planned as engagement activities with direct beneficiaries, and to have further impact potential. 

Direct beneficiaries include all those involved in project activities in the UK, Kenya and Nepal: staff at the project partner, Responding to Conflict (RTC); other organisations that deliver conflict transformation projects, peace-building and conflict transformation experts brought together in the opening and closing workshops, and in the project advisory group; conflict transformation practitioners, and people who have been parties to conflict, who we will work with in Kenya, Nepal and UK. 

Indirect beneficiaries include other NGOs working in developing countries in the field of peace-building, conflict transformation and other conflict-sensitive projects such as volunteering; the donors who fund this work, including governments, philanthropic foundations and charitable organisations; policymakers at government level, for example in Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DfID, or within charitable / philanthropic organisations; practitioners in areas connected to conflict transformation, e.g. mediation, conflict resolution, and education more generally. 


How will they benefit from this research?

For direct beneficiaries, the project will generate conversations, collaborations, new models of conflict transformation and tools for effective interventions, that each bring the dimension of empathy dynamics into conflict transformation processes. Concrete benefits include understandings offered by the Empathy in Conflict Map, strategies developed in the project for fostering empathy and dissolving dyspathy, alternative empathy-related indicators for progress towards positive peace, and stories and video film collected from key actor groups that may be used in dissemination, training and public engagement. Each of these also offers potential of the impact, both in the work of the direct beneficiaries and more broadly.

More effective conflict transformation intervention and evaluation should enhance the quality of life and health of parties to conflict in the project sites, producing more stable environments that support cessation of violence and peace building, increase human safety, and support the emergence of more stable, democratised societies and communities, all of which contribute to reduced global uncertainties and increased security. Social impact may also in turn lead to economic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K000713/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
