construction, demolition and quarrying industries for over 40 years. Their development has
seen only incremental improvements during this time. Major advancements in performance
are unlikely based on the mechanism utilised. The market however, continues to demand
superior performance-to-weight ratio with lower cost of ownership. Customers want to reduce
the resources required to operate their machines, increase the efficiency of breakers and fuel
consumption, while high noise levels remain a debilitating by-product of the technology.
Webster Technologies (WT) has a long history of developing pioneering ?heavy? equipment
since 1965. More recently, WT have been successful in developing a ?gearbox-less? rock
cutter attachment for excavators, which is now sold globally. Following extensive research
into alternative methods for generating higher impact forces, WT has developed a new type of
breaker concept unique to the market. The technology has the potential to address many of the
customer issues just outlined and make a step-change in breaker performance.
The revolutionary solution is based on a novel catapult piston mechanism, which has been
successful up to proof of concept (PoC) stage. During trials, the PoC system has demonstrated
4500 joules of impact energy at a lower engine revs. Like for like, our system delivers 3 to 4
times more impact energy than the best breaker currently available on the market, using
approx. 20% less fuel. The lower frequency of blows and lower excavator engine revs results
in a much lower perceived noise level by humans and confirmed by operator feedback during
PoC trials.
However, in order to deliver this product to market we must first undertake research and
development to address key challenges which arose during the experimental trials. By
overcoming these challenges we will deliver a fully tested and validated pre-production
prototype.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>112210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720456</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
