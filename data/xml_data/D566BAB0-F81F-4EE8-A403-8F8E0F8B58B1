In particular, this project will test whether there is a cross-cultural difference in the tendency to copy others? solutions to a problem (&amp;quot;social learning&amp;quot;) versus solving a problem on one?s own (&amp;quot;individual learning&amp;quot;). Previous experimental studies conducted by the lead UK researcher (Dr Mesoudi) have found that UK participants tend to copy other peoples? solutions to tasks less often than they should do, if they were maximising their monetary payoff.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The lead Hong Kong researcher (Prof Chang) has previously argued that Western people may be particularly predisposed to individual learning, and Asian people may rely more on social learning, due to the greater socio-political and environmental change historically in Western Europe compared to Asia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will directly compare Western and Asian learning styles to see whether the excessive individual learning found previously in the UK is a consequence of this cultural variation. Participants will engage in a simple computer-based task in which they design an artifact (an arrowhead) either through trial and error (individual learning) or by copying another participants? artifact (social learning).&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project relates directly to the &amp;quot;Social Diversity and Population Dynamics&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Understanding Individual Behaviour&amp;quot; ESRC priority areas. Major beneficiaries of this research include Chinese immigrants (especially students) to the UK who may face barriers to integration related to the differences in learning style explored in this project, and UK companies who have business dealings with China and may similarly face barriers to successful communication. 

Social and economic interaction with China is becoming increasingly important for the UK through migration, education and trade. Understanding how these two cultures differ in their learning style can improve this interaction. For example, Chinese students studying in the UK often have difficulty adjusting to the independent learning style encouraged at all levels of the UK educational system, and particularly university level. In business, too, UK employers may expect greater independent learning and autonomy from their employees than do Chinese employers, potentially creating problems in UK-China business interactions. Culturally-determined learning style may also influence consumer behaviour, with social-learning-based adverts (e.g. &amp;quot;buy this product because others are&amp;quot;) more effective in Asia and individual-learning-based adverts (e.g. &amp;quot;buy this product to be different to others&amp;quot;) more effective in the West. 

This project will determine the extent of these various differences, and through the unique use of rural and immigrant groups determine how malleable these differences are, both important factors when designing interventions to improve cross-cultural interaction. Our project therefore directly relates to the themes of immigration and social integration at the core of the &amp;quot;Social Diversity and Population Dynamics&amp;quot; priority area. An understanding of how culturally-influenced learning style influences individual behaviour (i.e. to solve a task via social or individual learning) also contributes to the &amp;quot;Understanding Individual Behaviour&amp;quot; priority area.

To aid dissemination of our findings to the public and to charities that deal with immigration and inter-cultural relations we will produce a project website that will describe the aims, methods and findings of the study in an accessible, easy-to-understand manner, and produce press releases to disseminate findings via local and national mass media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80566</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Macau</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Macao, Special Administrative Region of China</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Lei Chang</gtr:description><gtr:id>B743C5B9-23E8-4331-BEDB-89A2DFAFD942</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Funds from University of Macau (Department of Psychology) for a research trip to Prof Chang's department</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b766e5ddd994.97369696-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Funded trip to University of Macau where Professor Chang is now based in November 2016 to discuss publication plans.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Follow-up discussion with Prof Lei Chang related to the findings of the grant, with a review paper in preparation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant resulted in one main paper, Mesoudi et al. (2015, Proceedings of the Royal Society B). This paper reports the main finding that people from Mainland China choose to learn from others more than people from the UK, who rely more on their own judgement. People from Hong Kong, and Chinese students studying in the UK, both show similar learning styles to the White British participants, rather than the Mainland Chinese participants.

This paper was published in a high impact journal (IF=5.68) and is fully open access. As such, it promises to have a high impact in the disciplines of psychology and anthropology, and specifically the fields of cultural evolution and social learning, as well as other disciplines and the general public. According to the Royal Society website (http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1798/20142209.article-info), the full text of the paper has already been viewed 4712 times, and downloaded as a pdf 976 times. According to Altmetrics, links to the paper have been tweeted 54 times by 43 users, reaching a theoretical total of 40,494 twitter users, and placing it within the top 5% of all articles scored by Altmetrics. According to Google Scholar the paper has already been cited 14 times.

Our findings open up many new avenues for future research, such as the extent to which this cross-cultural variation extends beyond the UK and China; what factors are responsible for maintaining the cultural variation (e.g. education, mass media, peer observation, parental instruction); and how exactly learning styles shift in immigrants and East Asians exposed to Western influence.

A novel international collaboration was developed between Alex Mesoudi (Durham, UK, now Exeter) and Lei Chang (CUHK, Hong Kong), which will strengthen links in this area between the UK and Hong Kong and lead to further grants and publications. One further publication is already in press (for Trends in Ecology and Evolution).

The ESRC research fellow employed on the grant (Dr Keelin Murray) benefitted from a high profile publication and training in lab experimental methods to study social learning, and has gone on to take up a 3-year postdoctoral position at the University of St Andrews.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E30B83FF-2C73-4336-8D60-7502DD66EC69</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>544f9b9611ac21.72697998</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We used a computer task to examine people's tendency to copy others (what we call 'social learning') versus rely on their own experience (called 'individual learning') in a novel and challenging computer-based artifact design task. Participants designed an arrowhead and test their design on a series of 'hunts'. The objective is to find the optimal arrowhead designs via either social learning (copying the design of another participant) or individual learning (trial and error, with no social information).

Key findings and outcomes include:

1. People from mainland China copied others significantly more than people from the UK, indicating that there may be East-West differences in people's reliance on social learning to solve novel and complex tasks. This provides experimental support for informal observations and indirect evidence that there are broad East-West differences in social learning within educational systems and business contexts.

2. People from Hong Kong and Chinese immigrants in the UK both showed equivalent levels of social learning to the White British UK participants. This indicates that Western influence (either through historical British rule in Hong Kong, or being immersed in a Western society) can fairly quickly shift learning styles from individual to social learning. 

3. People from mainland China were less responsive to changes within the game (specifically, in what made a good artifact), whereas the other groups increased their social learning in response to uncertainty.

4. These findings open up many new avenues for future research, such as the extent to which this cross-cultural variation extends beyond the UK and China; what factors are responsible for maintaining the cultural variation (e.g. education, mass media, peer observation, parental instruction); and how exactly learning styles shift in immigrants and East Asians exposed to Western influence.

5. A novel international collaboration was developed between Alex Mesoudi (Durham, UK) and Lei Chang (CUHK, Hong Kong), which will strengthen links in this area between the UK and Hong Kong and lead to further grants and publications. 

6. The ESRC research fellow employed on the grant (Dr Keelin Murray) will benefit from at least one high profile publication, training in lab experimental methods to study social learning, and has gone on to take up a 3-year postdoctoral position at the University of St Andrews.

Mesoudi, A., Chang, L., Dall, S.X. &amp;amp; Thornton, A. (in press) The evolution of individual and cultural variation in social learning. Trends in Ecology and Evolution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Future research might explore the factors that maintain East-West differences in social learning, such as peer observation, parental instruction, mass media or education. Longitudinal studies might track immigrants as they are potentially influenced by their new and different society. 

Theoretical models examining the evolution and use of social learning need to incorporate the possibility that social learning might itself be socially learned. Lab experiments need to consider the cultural backgrounds of their participants in order to draw reasonable conclusions about 'human' social learning, given that there may be no single, universal 'human' way of learning.

Real-world implications include educational contexts, such as when East Asian students studying in the UK fail to adapt to a situation where copying others is considered plagiarism and penalised, even though it may be normal practice in their home country. In organisational contexts East Asian companies also rely less on innovation than Western countries, which may be rooted in these deeper differences in learning styles.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>727C021C-9D77-4438-933B-8F4CD560D45D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f9a949e12f2.30130105</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/social.learning/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4BC867E0-2429-4F18-A00E-368A4C681C45</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Evolution of Individual and Cultural Variation in Social Learning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trends in ecology &amp; evolution</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b045fb7a5b7a944986f16423e76a87d3"><gtr:id>b045fb7a5b7a944986f16423e76a87d3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mesoudi A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0169-5347</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56a747c2d71b97.96292158</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>25C95418-A562-4726-9642-010A1D4C79D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Higher frequency of social learning in China than in the West shows cultural variation in the dynamics of cultural evolution.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
