Tacit philosophical assumptions in the debates within the Campbell Collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H007857/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Evidence-based policy is now mandated throughout the UK and the USA, and increasingly in Europe, at international, national and local levels. Modelled on the Cochrane Collaboration in medicine, the Campbell Collaboration is an independent, international, non-profit organization which has been set up to provide 'decision-makers with evidence-based information to empower them to make well-informed decisions about the effects of interventions in the social, behavioural and educational arenas' (www.campbellcollaboration.org). There are, however, major debates, both within the Campbell Collaboration and with its critics, about what counts as acceptable evidence in evidence-based policy and practice and how its strength as support for a particular hypothesis can be judged.\nThis project, focusing on the cases studies of child social welfare and education, aims to clarify and help resolve these controversies by analysing the philosophical assumptions that tacitly inform them. Most of the controversies appear to originate from different demands put on what evidence should deliver and what it can deliver, given the level of the knowledge base and the complexity of the subject matter. \nWe shall examine a number of well-established and yet disputable distinctions that we conjecture add confusion to the debate. It often seems that opponents are failing to understand each other's positions because they are implicitly adopting different philosophical assumptions about the nature of the social world or of scientific method.\n\nWe shall address six key issues. First, quantitative and qualitative data: a distinction between the two is widely accepted with the former being generally considered more valid and reliable than the latter. But in social welfare and education, practitioners reason on the basis of partial and ambiguous data about people's behaviour. In what ways precisely do quantitative and qualitative data differ and in what ways is the former purportedly more reliable. \n\nA linked issue is the distinction between objective and subjective that, in practice, becomes a distinction between general and local knowledge, namely between methodology/expertise and more judgment-based approaches . Can the advantages of the general knowledge and expertise in research methods be gained without sacrificing local knowledge?\n\nThird, the area of social welfare raises questions about who decides what counts as a solution in social interventions and how competing claims should be handled/adjudicated. In a subject area that deals with the least powerful groups in society, this issue is of special importance.\n\nA fourth issue is whether a clear hierarchy of methods inadvertently leads to a hierarchy of questions, inevitably prioritising those questions that can be studied by the higher ranked methods. \n\nThe fifth question addresses the difference between 'clinching' methods of evidence (their conclusions are deduced from a positive result) and ''vouching' ones (conclusions upheld by evidence deemed to be satisfactory, possibly relevant etc. Clinching evidence requires so many assumptions and conditions that its application becomes, we fear, very limited. How should the trade-off between scope of application and certainty of conclusion be managed?\n\nThe final issue questions the difference between closed and open research methods. The former, such as RCTs, have built-in devices for checking the assumptions that are needed to apply the method. The latter, such as Bayes-net,require appeal to other devices. Need best evidence be supplied by closed methods or can a wider range be acceptable?\n\nThe outcome of these analyses will provide the basis for articulating a philosophy of science that meets the requirements and needs of practical research. We will aim at suggesting a theory of evidence that is both theoretically sound and realistically enforceable and thus contributes to the successful development of the Campbell project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Not Required</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>179548</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Radio 4 with Ben Goldacre, discussing &quot;Evidence Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing it Better&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>414E6A11-886E-4A52-86C4-423F1393470A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Medic and author Ben Goldacre explores the idea of evidence-based policy and asks if it can ever become a reality in the UK.

In medicine, how do we know if a particular treatment works? The simple answer is to subject it to a fair test against other treatments or a placebo. So far the best example of a fair test in medicine is a randomised controlled trial or RCT.

Often to referred to as 'the gold standard' when it comes to determining what works, RCTs are now commonplace in business. But what about government? The idea of evidence-based policy is hardly new - it's what social scientists have been banging on about since the 1960s. But in practice, when evidence has been used to determine policy, it's often been anything but 'gold-standard'.

In this programme, the medic and author of Bad Science, Ben Goldacre, sets out to explore the potential for putting RCTs at the heart of the policy-making process, arguing that not only can they reveal if our existing policies are effective but RCTs have the potential to transform the way we create and implement social policy across the country, from education to health, from welfare to crime.

Of course not everyone agrees that all you need is hard data to make the best policy. Experience, values, ideology - these, say critics should never be abandoned in favour of cold statistics. And whilst the RCT may work well for pills and potions, it's too blunt an instrument to deal with the subtle and complex challenges of assessing how best to punish crime, treat drug users or teach children from impoverished background to read and write. Just look at the recent fiasco over badger-culling. over a ten-year period, randomised experiments and pilot studies have resulted in no clear policy on how to prevent the spread of bovine TB. And then there's the ethical question - how for example could you allow randomisation to determine something as morally (and politically) sensitive as sentencing criminals, let alone teaching kids?

What is clear, is that bad policies cost us dear - both socially and economically. The challenges are many but the potential, argues Ben, could be truly transformational, both for society and for government.

Linus Pauling Memorial Lecture, Institute for Science, Engineering and Public Policy, 'From Science to Policy.&amp;nbsp; What's so Good about Evidence?'
Evidence-based policy has been all the rage for over a decade. Clearly it is better to inform decisions by evidence than merely by ideology, wishful thinking or casual observation. But the methods standardly recommended - that social policy imitate evidence-based medicine, relying on gold-standard randomized-controlled-trials - are a bad way of using evidence to predict if policies will work in practice. This talk shows how to do better.

What then is a mechanism? I shall describe three senses common in philosophy: 1) invariant relations (sponsored by James Woodward), 2) causal processes (probably the usual sense in medical literature) and 3) relatively fixed arrangements of parts that act together to afford or explain causal regularities (defended by William Bechtel and by MDC : Machamer, Craver and Darden). I claim these are distinct senses. But Peter Menzies claims that by employing a 'structural equations' framework, one can in one fell swoop use 1) the invariant-relations idea to give a much needed explication of the idea of 'action' central to 3) and thereby give a much needed account of how mechanisms in sense 3) explain causal regularities.

I think Menzies is really dealing with 2) causal processes all along; his account has no space for 3) parts and their actions. But we need to keep this third sense of 'mechanism' centre-stage because it is correct that it is mechanisms in this sense that underwrite the familiar causal processes we rely on throughout daily life and much of science and policy. Without attention to the mechanisms (sense 3)) that afford causal regularities we have no idea how far they stretch nor when and where they will break down. Looking at Menzies' valiant attempt, as I shall do, and seeing how, if I am right, it fails shows just how true this is. I shall illustrate with some examples from child welfare and development policy.

That is now uncontroversial to the point of triviality-of course policy should be based on the facts. But are the methods that policymakers rely on to gather and analyze evidence the right ones? Nancy Cartwright explains that the dominant methods now in use-methods that imitate standard practices in medicine, like randomized control trials-do not work. They fail because they do not enhance our ability to predict if policies will be effective.

Current guides for the use of evidence tend to rank scientific methods according to the degree of trustworthiness of the evidence they produce. That is valuable in certain respects, but it offers little advice about how to think about putting such evidence to use. How, then, can policymakers use evidence effectively? Prof. Cartwright will explain what types of information are most necessary for making reliable policy and offer lessons on how to organize that information.

&amp;quot;Moving on the Evidence-Based Policy: Experiments Versus the Modelling of Society&amp;quot;
Abstract: Science can help us build a better society. That's the point of evidence-based policy, which is proclaimed worldwide, in education, medicine, development, child welfare, justice, crime prevention, public health, and finance. It affects us all. And who could object to using good scientific evidence to inform our predictions about whether our proposed policies will work? The big question though is, 'What's good evidence?' I want to focus on one central issue: Should we experiment or should we model? I say both, lots of both.

In my analysis and recommendations, I was able to use the thinking developed in this study to inform my understanding of knowledge and skills in child protection work, and in particular in social work. The sections on using research evidence were based on discussions I had with my co-researchers in the AHRC study. The recommendations of my final report 'The Munro Review of Child Protection (2011)' were all accepted and the more nuanced view of the role of research evidence and how to appraise its relevance that were set out in the report have been widely accepted.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545bd8089d61a0.37664318</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76B362CE-9E1E-48C6-B329-AA8DBF1E4FA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The limitations of randomized controlled trials in predicting effectiveness.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of evaluation in clinical practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cf9aa64f9752fbac58e473bd0f6e17a7"><gtr:id>cf9aa64f9752fbac58e473bd0f6e17a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartwright N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1356-1294</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54623790442dd6.89757986</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED847B45-D25D-4827-B8F2-BAAD2CEC4A38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Measurement in Medicine: Philosophical Essays on Assessment and Evaluation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9678b95c1332ee798319dcf0e18eb097"><gtr:id>9678b95c1332ee798319dcf0e18eb097</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartwright, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781783488476</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58aae59c88a848.54953589</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3875A6E1-3F78-4E69-923D-A6FBF07FC4F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sage Handbook of Social Work</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/858e2eb006eb2af2f21f902c59ac2945"><gtr:id>858e2eb006eb2af2f21f902c59ac2945</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gray, Mel; Webb, Stephen A.; Midgley, James O.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781849207515</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-917310641.07018593bcaa2f2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BFC72288-27B2-4EA2-B35B-B47FB1ACD51D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Knowing what we are talking about: why evidence doesn't always travel</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cf9aa64f9752fbac58e473bd0f6e17a7"><gtr:id>cf9aa64f9752fbac58e473bd0f6e17a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartwright N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545cc82ac8d9d7.90012862</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08472158-6AC0-43A4-8606-3FFAC4FCA5C3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making the Most of the Evidence in Education: A Guide for Working Out What Works...Here and Now</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9678b95c1332ee798319dcf0e18eb097"><gtr:id>9678b95c1332ee798319dcf0e18eb097</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartwright, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58aae9aacd4b11.33422793</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A5523B7-1083-4F69-B0CB-DA6BD7092BE9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evidence-Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing It Better</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/555c0626ad93b07a1dc5f3a2a723c4cd"><gtr:id>555c0626ad93b07a1dc5f3a2a723c4cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cartwright</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199841622</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cc97351bd43.77773213</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D771959E-81C4-439D-AC2A-B175521F5542</gtr:id><gtr:title>Presidential Address: Will This Policy Work for You?
