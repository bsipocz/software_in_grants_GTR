characterise the molecular determinants that correlate with virus virulence, greater transmission and spread and to develop efficacious vaccines and highly sensitive diagnostic tests. This project will take forward our recent studies on Dynamics, selection and pathogenicity in avian influenza viruses: from individual to population and Genetic evolution in H9N2 viruses in poultry. These studies revealed that a number of precise molecular genetic changes in avian influenza virus genes could enhance virus adaption and fitness during experimental introduction or during natural circulation in chickens, turkeys and ducks, which directly correlate with increased virus virulence and transmissibility in different poultry hosts. To further study the functional role of these molecular markers, we will utilise a number of molecular, genetic and biophysical techniques to investigate how these mutations/substitutions affect the virus life cycle and increase pathogenicity. 
In addition, the project encompasses the development of new improved control strategies against avian influenza viruses by developing new vaccines and highly specific diagnostic tests.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>649948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Francis Crick Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Understanding diversity of avian influenza viruses and improvement disease control in poultry and humans</gtr:description><gtr:id>DEB3D58F-7651-44CE-B3C2-BA71CFB51612</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ultimate aims of this collaboration are to reduce the impact of influenza virus on poultry production and reduce their zoonotic transmission to humans.
