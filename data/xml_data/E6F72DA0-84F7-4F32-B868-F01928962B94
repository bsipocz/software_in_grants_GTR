This is true not only in respect of tissue or organ restoration but also the ability to heal wounds without a scar. The long term aim of this group is to extend our abilities to repair and regenerate after injury and loss. In order to contribute to these goals we work on mammals and also on animals which have significantly greater ability to restore tissues or heal wounds. If we understood more about the mechanisms that underly such processes, then this would provide new opportunities to promote them in mammals.

We work in a variety of contexts that are relevant to regenerative medicine. These include the regeneration of sensory receptors in the ear, a cell type whose loss is a major cause of deafness, the regeneration of the lung, a significant focus in relation to the increasing incidence of emphysema and other smoking related disorders, the regeneration of limb, heart and the ocular lens, the mechanisms underlying scar free healing of wounds, the regeneration of the deer antler, a rare example of substantial regeneration in adult mammals, and the regeneration of the nerve cells in the spinal cord. Our experience is that the experimental approaches and results from one context are often helpful for progress in another and hence that there are clear benefits from such a group organisation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1.Repair and regeneration ? lessons from the embryo (Martin and Price) ? these studies test which developmental signalling cascades are reactivated during repair (mouse, zebrafish and Drosophila models) and regeneration (deer antler model);
2.Regeneration of auditory hair cells ? lessons from newts (Forge, Brockes) ? investigations of cell cyclerequirements for auditory epithelium repair and regeneration in newt;
3. Respecification of position and organ identity by retinoids (Maden, Price and Brockes) ? dissecting the molecular nature of retinoid-regulated cell surface molecules that control positional values during regeneration events in newt limb and tail and deer antlers:
4. Regulation of cytoskeleton during epithelial repair (Martin and Gale) ? live analysis of the dynamic actin events within cells as they change their shapes and contacts, and move to fill an epithelial defect (Drosophila and tissue culture models);
5. Mechanisms underlying neural/bone regeneration (Ferretti and Maden) ? testing means to modulate repair in these tissues which normally have very little regenerative capacity;
6. Mechanisms underlying regeneration of limbs and antlers (Price, Maden and Brockes) ? utilising tools established in newt (eg gene gun), to analyse parallels between these two dramatic regenerative models. 

In this application we are seeking funds to continue a highly successful series of half day meetings/workshops several times each year where we invite one or two key players in the repair and regeneration field to give a seminar alongside a short talk by a post-doc or graduate student from one of the host labs. Funds are for flights, accommodation and subsistence for our visitors and sandwich lunch and room booking fees for these meetings. The meetings are always hugely well attended by all members of our labs (generally 40+ people), but are small enough to be great forums for discussion. Our European and American speakers have all stayed on for several days and visited each of our labs, providing a fantastic opportunity for external critical input and a chance for our post-docs and grad students to meet up and talk science and post-doc possibilities with scientists who they would not ordinarily meet up with.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1998-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ear Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Developing the newt as a model for studying hair cell regeneration</gtr:description><gtr:id>C201273D-CA06-4F2C-B0D0-1DB3737C7547</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Studentship awarded to Andy Forge (co-supervisor Jeremy Brockes) by Deafness Research UK.
