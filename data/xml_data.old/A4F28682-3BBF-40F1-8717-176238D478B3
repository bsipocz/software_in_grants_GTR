I Critical editions of operas have, of course, long been in existence; indeed, much of my career has been spent in this field, , in which I have published editions of operas by Verdi and Donizetii (I am also general editor of the Donizetti complete edition). 
However, and in spite of widespread agreement that some of Puccini's operas pose severe editorial problems, no critical edition of any of his operas has yet been attempted (the nearest thing is a &amp;quot;revision according to the autograph&amp;quot; of Tosca, something I completed for Ricordi in the late 1980s, and whose vocal score was published by them in 1995). This lack of editions is primarily due to the fact that Puccinian source situation is extremely complex. For a typical Puccini opera there are a very large number of composer-authorised sources, including an autograph score, printed libretto, numerous printed editions of vocal and orchestral scores, printed parts, etc. These copious sources tend to differ one from the other, often in significant ways; and while we can be sure (from epistolary and other evidence) that the composer had a hand in some of the differences, we rarely have evidence of what precisely he wanted changed, and what got altered on the whim of publishers or conductors or others.

The case of Manon Lescaut is, if anything, the most extreme in this regard. Depending on how one counts, there are between four and eight (or more) discrete versions of the opera between its premiere in 1893 and 1923. All eight editions of the published vocal score differ from each other; none offers any account of the reasons for the differences. However, there are two sources held in the Ricordi archive in Milan (long known about but never thoroughly consulted) that can add something decisive to the problem. Both are orchestral scores with numerous autograph annotations, some by Puccini, others by the conductor Toscanini and various employees of the Ricordi firm. A detailed examination of these sources can solve a great many of the editorial issues surrounding the opera, allowing one to arrive at a true &amp;quot;critical&amp;quot; edition of the score: one that isolates and documents all the available versions and discusses in Notes and other Critical apparatus all significant variants.

The resulting critical edition of Manon Lescaut will add to our understanding of Puccini in various important ways. It' give scholars and performers access to certain musical materials that have not been seen or heard for more than a hundred years. Particularly important in this respect are two sections of the opera. The first is the original (1893) finale to Act I, which will appear as an appendix. This finale betrays a radically different aesthetic attitude on the part of the composer. Its violent, tutta forza reprise of the act's most prominent solo aria &amp;quot;Donna non vidi mai&amp;quot;, is distinctly at odds with the revised version, which recalls a far more ironic passage from earlier in the act (the aria &amp;quot;Tra voi bella&amp;quot;), and which places the entire drama thus far in a much altered light. 
The second important appendix will contain the various versions of Manon's Act IV aria, &amp;quot;Sola, perduta, abbandonata&amp;quot;. Puccini tinkered with this aria throughout his career (even cutting it entirely at one point), in the process offering scholars and performers many insights into his changing attitude to the heroine and his tolerance for long, set-piece arias that &amp;quot;interrupt&amp;quot; the action.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My critical edition has been used around the whole as the basis for performances of Manon Lescaut.
