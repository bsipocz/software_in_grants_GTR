Violence and security are key dimensions of economic development and social welfare. An emerging economy with strong global potential, Mexico's current security crisis has exposed the weaknesses of state security responses with serious implications for investment, employment and poverty reduction. Trust in the state's security provision is very low, and this encourages vigilante justice, dependence on private security amongst those with resources to pay for it and also generates the impunity which further fuels violence and criminality. Local economies have succumbed to criminal actors, and a range of drug trafficking organisations have expanded and mutated their illegal activities. Extortion as well as threats of violence blight the lives of thousands of citizens. Many Mexican community, civil and state actors are searching for new options to reduce violence and criminality. This research and action project will develop and test methodologies for co- constructing security provision with these actors in four carefully selected case studies locations: Tijuana, Apatzingan, Acapulco and Guadalupe. It will work with community, civil society and state actors to both better diagnose the security threats they face but most importantly to build shared understandings of security as an effective and equitable public good in their localities. It will encourage understanding of the differential impacts of violence, insecurity and security provision according to income, gender, ethnicity and other social factors. It will use 'local security agendas' constructed from the ground up, to influence the national security approaches in Mexico and beyond. Finally, It will use the research to contribute to wider debates in the global South around security, violence and development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research aims at short, medium and longer term impacts:
1. In the short term, this project will gather together a group of scholars, community researchers, civil and state actors prepared to work together around one of the most pressing problems of Mexico today. At the scholarly level, the mere fact that important Mexican Universities (two national and one local, based in Tijuana, one of the most challenging of Mexican cities in security terms) are collaborating with Peace Studies in Bradford University, UK (an internationally recognised centre of excellence for the study of peace), will put the security issue in Mexico on the agenda in a new way. ITAM and CIDE are highly respected national universities with access to policy makers and state actors. By co-constructing knowledge and action plans around security, the aim is to refresh the security debate in Mexico and suggest a new methodology for influencing thinking and practice on security provision. This will impact on the Mexican university sector, by enhancing the attention given by scholars to the security problem. In the local case study sites, the collaboration will not only generate new evidence on violence dynamics, but give impetus to dialogues between actors who are situated in distinct positionalities in terms of experiencing and responding to insecurity and violence and who rarely come together. By building conversations between communities, particularly poor communities, experiencing chronic violence; civil society actors who despite danger to themselves wish to make visible the threats from rising crime and violence; and state actors who face unprecedented challenges including the loss of the trust and respect of citizens, which they need in order to operate, this project will have immediate impacts in terms of opening up the Mexican security debate in new directions and fostering practical new approaches .
2. In the medium term, the 'Local Security Agendas' which will emerge from the work in the case study sites, aim to capture the complexity of dynamics on the ground in Mexico and how violence and insecurity differentially affect population groups. It is expected that the very construction of these agendas will generate a sense of renewal in terms of security thinking with practical implications around diminishing mistrust, addressing tendencies to implement vigilante justice, and encouraging people to feel they can open up conversations where they were unable to do so in the past. These Local Security Agendas will then be discussed as part of an effort to rethink Mexican national security provision as an effective and equitable public good. The dissemination events are aimed to scale up the impact of the local research and to demonstrate the evidence of how the state might respond in new ways to the knowledge gathered through the participatory process and which has been validated through rigorous analysis using NVIVO software, returning the findings to participants for further input, and peer review. Although this is an impact envisaged during the life of the project, it is one that the project will encourage to continue through the constituencies it will bring together of academics, communities, civil society groups and state actors.
3. In the longer term, the Briefing Paper, the final conference, the sharing of findings with other influential academics and policy makers in Washington, the academic publications and dissemination will open up serious debate about new approaches to security provision in Mexico and beyond. The project aims to encourage sustainable dialogues at the local level that will outlast the project while fostering national debate and even international debate on security provision in the global South.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P00850X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04B7A494-75A7-4241-9AA9-A7791BD4328A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic &amp; Latin American Stud</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28E947B7-D5E4-4F18-9608-1A8534D290F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Peace Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A153974-B803-439F-95AD-724028C45340</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Security Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
