During the past decades the world has been assaulted by the idea of a possible exhaustion of our fossil fuel supply in a relative short period of time, dramatically increasing energy costs as it becomes more and more scarce. The way to face this problem is obviously to look for environment friendly energy sources that satisfy the criteria of being i) cheap, ii) environmentally benign and iii) inexhaustible. Among the ones that satisfy the criteria is the use of sunlight to produce energy by the photovoltaic effect.Recently much attention has been focused on organic, polymeric or hybrid systems for photovoltaic operation. Such solar cells need to be cheap and easy to produce for practical applications. In addition, questions of energy conversion efficiency and long-term stability need to be addressed. Two distinct, but complementary, methodologies have emerged; mesoscopic dye sensitized (DSC) and bulk organic (or polymeric) heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.In the BHJ configuration, a mixture of a conjugated polymer (donor) and charge acceptor, usually a fullerene derivative, are sandwiched between two metallic electrodes, one of which is transparent. This architecture has the advantage of giving the possibility of process and assemble the active layer using a single step from solution, and make use of classical printing techniques on different types of substrates, avoiding high temperatures and more expensive deposition methods.Organic solar cells differ from their inorganic counterparts by producing bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) upon light absorption; these excitons, as a result of the low dielectric constants of the active medium, show a considerable electron-hole binding energy, around 0.4 eV, and as a consequence, exciton dissociation occurs only at the interface between two materials of different electron affinities, working as electron donor (D) and the electron acceptor (A), which yield a driving force for charge separation.Understanding the fundamental electronic interactions between the D and A materials as well as the role of the composite film morphology, device architecture and processing conditions, is crucial to achieve high efficiencies. Over the last few years progress has been mostly achieved through the understanding of the importance of the active layer morphology, especially the type of solvent used, polymer regioregularity and film annealing conditions to the device final performance.In the proposed research, several electron donor and acceptor materials will be investigated in order to unravel the processes that control the formation and recombination of free charge carriers in organic photovoltaic devices. A particular focus of the research will be the investigation of conjugated materials containing heavy atom complexes, which give rise to an intrinsic mechanism that promotes the formation of triplet excitons. This very rapidly and efficiently converts all polymer singlets into polymer triplets that can be used as electron donors in photovoltaic operation. A detailed investigation of these materials as donor materials in BHJ solar cells is still lacking, and the concept of using long lived triplet excitons in charge generation deserves further attention, particularly in order to clarify the effect of the increasing mixing of singlet and triplet states on the energy of the CT state and geminate back electron transfer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the research project is to perform a comprehensive photophysical investigation of processes that govern the efficiency of photoinduced charge generation in molecular materials. This is aimed at the emergent photovoltaic market based on organic materials. Together with academic Institutions and Laboratories, companies working in this sector will be the main beneficiaries. However, the general public and everyone concerned with environment and energy efficiency policies will also benefit from the research outputs. Both polymers and small molecules have been used in organic photovoltaics (OPV). While the efficiencies of organic based devices is still low when compared with the more commonly used, but more costly, a-Si or CIGS thin film approaches, the possibility of using flexible, cheap, lightweight nanostructured organic semiconductor materials opens a completely new route to produce low-cost photovoltaic devices for use in portable applications, as for example, smart lamps, photoactive textiles, laptops or mobile phones. More and more companies are being attracted to the OPVs market. Plextronics a materials production company is developing its OPV niche. Heliatek has investments from Bosh and BASF to develop OPV solar panels, in Wales, G24i has built an OPV facility using technology licensed from Gretzel, and Konarka has recently announced a line of solar panels for use in portable applications. A complete understanding of the mechanism that controls the charge generation in molecular materials is still lacking, and the factors that ultimately govern the generation of free charges upon light absorption in molecular materials are still not completely understood. This is crucial to highlight targets for new material structures, and to improve device efficiencies from 5% to 10%, the aimed target that will allow establishing OPV as a valuable alternative in the photovoltaic market and challenge silicon based technology. This research aims to help make this step forward. Academics and companies concerned with the photovoltaic technology will be able to immediately incorporate the research outputs and establish new synthetic targets, alternative device fabrication steps and device structures in order to create devices of social, economic and commercial interest. The Organic Electroactive Materials Group in the Durham University, where the Dr Dias is currently developing his scientific activity, has a long track record of collaboration with industry and other academic institutions and laboratories, both in the UK and abroad, Dr Dias has worked with CDT and Thorn for 5 years and currently holds a position partially funded by CDT. The existing links will be exploited to maximize the impact of the present proposal. If new triplet route works, this could rapidly be taken into PETEC or Konarka for device development, giving UK a strong position in this future market. This will be a good return to the EPSRC investment. Finally, physics students of our department will also be direct beneficiaries of the present research project through the realization of workshops, postgraduate lectures and final year research projects into the field of organic photovoltaics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101401</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At the fundamental research level, this project contributed directly to the understanding, and design of novel organic photovoltaic materials, which are currently under investigation.

The photoinduced charge generation mechanism in organic materials is still not fully understood. However the current view is that the mechanism involves the creation of excitons when light is absorbed in the active layer, and after these excitons have diffused to the D/A interface, electron transfer between both materials leads to the creation of a charge transfer intermediate (CT). Dissociation of this CT intermediate is then crucial for the formation of free charges, which then need to be collected at the corresponding electrodes. 

An important limiting factor for the formation of free charges is thus the recombination/dissociation affecting the intermediate CT exciton formed at the D/A interface. However, the mechanism is still unclear and even the existence of this intermediate has been questioned. 

In this project we were interested on the investigation of fundamental aspects that affect the dissociation and recombination of the CT intermediate. We have designed an experimental system where the kinetics of CT excitons and free charges is followed in model donor/acceptor blend systems, without the interference of other spectroscopic signatures, as energy transfer or significant exciton migration for example. 

We then discovered that instead of a simple sequential mechanism, where free charges occur from CT dissociation only, both CT excitons and free charges are promptly formed at the interface between D and A materials, however while the CT excitons are affected by fast recombination, the free charges are able to migrate from the interfaces to the bulk quasi-crystalline regions. 

The blend morphology has a strong impact on the ratio of free charges and CT excitons that are formed. Increasing the phase segregation between the two materials leads to a pronounced increase on the fraction of free charges formed directly.

Direct recombination of the CT geminate pair to the triplet state of the donor is observed to compete with CT dissociation and acts to fundamentally reduce the total number of free charges generated in the blend.

Both recombination and dissociation are strongly dependent on the blend morphology, with increased free charge yields obtained by creating percolation pathways for charge to move away from interfacial regions. However, under such conditions rapid exciton recombination within the donor domains occurs before the onset of electron transfer, and acts to further reduce the yield of free charges.

The understanding we achieved from the study of CT states in this ward has been very helpful to understand the mechanism supporting harvesting of triplet states in molecular systems that I am currently studying, which use CT states to harvest dark triplet excitons for application in light emitting diodes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project outputs will be explored in order to design and synthesize new materials, and fabricate organic solar cell devices with optimized structures. This research gives important directions to fully understand the mechanism governing the photoinduced charge generation in blends of organic materials. I am now studying molecules that use CT excitons to harvest dark triplet states to contribute to the electroluminescence in organic light emitting diodes. I am also starting to explore the photoconductive response in organic charge transfer interfaces in single organic crystals. Important features for electronic applications, such as molecular purity, charge mobility and exciton diffusion length, reveal a superior improved performance in single crystals when compared with materials in a more disordered form. The understanding gain in this award will strongly support the investigation of these crystalline structures.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BB097B11-7A27-4D7B-8B0F-864970F782C5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2850564394.93835357765e502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>29633008-99C9-4EAA-AB46-893155897567</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rational
