However, we currently lack evidence that such genetic contributions could be preferentially retained through natural selection- hybridization maybe a consequence rather than a cause of speciation. In particular, the role that hybridization plays in the generation of hundreds of species in adaptive radiations is unclear. Recent advances in genome technologies make studying this process in detail an exciting possibility - DNA technology can identify &amp;quot;genomic islands of speciation&amp;quot;- loci under selection (or linked to regions under selection) which show divergence between species relative to the rest of the genome. Crucially, the genetic contributions of these adaptively important genetic regions from divergent founding lineages can then be identified in adaptive radiations. In this proposal, I plan to demonstrate that the &amp;quot;text book&amp;quot; Lake Malawi cichlid fish radiation consists of collections of adaptively important genomic regions from different sources. The project will capitalise on the recent Astatotilapia burtoni cichlid genome sequence, advancing our understanding by genome-wide screening of more than 20 species at once in order to identify tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using RAD-tag sequencing. Genome scans will identify regions of the genome important in adaptation, and I will then test whether these regions in the endemic radiation lineages show a signal of hybridization with putative seeding lineages, compared to &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; regions. This approach will be the first evidence to demonstrate that loci under selection in an adaptive radiation have distinct origins, confirming the importance of hybridization as a driving force for adaptive change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work seeks to identify the genomic regions involved in cichlid adaptation. I hope to identify genetic architecture of hybrid origin which accounts for the incredible diversity of cichlid fish which has evolved in Lake Malawi, using second generation sequencing techniques. Beneficiaries will mostly be academic, however I anticipate a range of non-academic users might have an interest in the outcomes.

Academic users will be able to access the following outputs from the work: peer-reviewed open access (where possible) journal articles, raw and analysed data held in e.g. European Nucleotide Archive, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/. PDRA and PI will also attend ESEB Lisbon to disseminate results. Non academics will benefit from a range of activities proposed to make the link between genotype and phenotype. In particular, demonstrations of how some simple code can pull data from a genome database, and further show how particular genomic regions might relate to the phenotypes visible in a tank of diverse cichlid fish. This will be a powerful way to make clear the relationship between DNA sequencing and evolution, and might also put into context the media attention that genome sequencing tends to receive, taking it from an abstract concept to a more accessible phenomenon.

Non academic users (primarily schoolchildren and local aquarists) will be engaged through my work as Deputy Schools Liaison officer, presenting the work at University Open Days, through University &amp;quot;Summer Experience Masterclasses&amp;quot; and through specially designed visits from local schools for molecular biology and genomic workshops.

I will continue to publicise peer-reviewed academic articles through the University press office, website and twitter feed and continue to publicise my work on Departmental websites. I will add a public-orientated version of the website to complement our academic site, which will have information written for the general reader.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65449</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Soapbox Science Hull 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A624AFFE-4AD9-422C-9B79-D7D1BDD45A76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Soap box Science is an international organisation which aims to bring science to the public and raise the profile of women in STEM.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c971ca0119a6.22474772</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2016-hull/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main discoveries so far, are the identification of regions of the genome which are important in adaptation to deep water (stretches of DNA that affect vision, and the capacity for haemoglobin to carry oxygen) and genetic regions that might regulate some sexual behaviour in fish. These both advance our understanding of how genomes are shaped by selection, and are particularly interesting given how quickly these adaptations have arisen in cichlid fish.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One novel finding was the role that the gene phakinin plays in adaptation to deep water. We hypothesise that this protein (previously known to be involved in lens clarity) can be alternatively spliced to affect lens clarity, and hope to test this. Knowing how differential expression can affect vision may prove to be useful in medicine. In another group of cichlid fish, we also identify a receptor which we think affects a range of behaviours- this mirrors findings in model organisms such as mice. Associating genes with behaviours might prove useful in other fields too.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22053C63-CCD2-4CFB-85CC-B2218301D4F6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc638b094057.13012294</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2668231-D3D1-4AC5-AA72-0678187DB403</gtr:id><gtr:title>The genomic basis of cichlid fish adaptation within the deepwater &amp;quot;twilight zone&amp;quot; of Lake Malawi</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Evolution Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2807b105d4b04ba9964296107314e76f"><gtr:id>2807b105d4b04ba9964296107314e76f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hahn C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc6ddbff639.95472387</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AA99B51B-97CB-491F-9696-240BDFA94843</gtr:id><gtr:title>The genomic basis of adaptation to the deep water 'twilight zone' in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0e4b4cf933ce315f4f4e9215ba051bc7"><gtr:id>0e4b4cf933ce315f4f4e9215ba051bc7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hahn, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c972999e48c6.59501736</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K000829/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F9C365-02D0-4623-9A73-8CA09DA0FFF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Evolution &amp; populations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4661C82D-F66E-4672-BA82-7C12180BBDF7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
