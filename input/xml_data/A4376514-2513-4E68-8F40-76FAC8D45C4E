animals</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M011461/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Research on domesticated animals has important socio-economic impacts, including underpinning and accelerating improvements in the animal sector of agriculture, contributing to medical research by providing animal models, improving animal health and welfare and informing understanding of natural and wild animal populations. Knowledge of the genes that shape farm and companion animals is essential for such research.
The sequence of almost all genes (a draft genome sequence) has been determined for major farmed and companion animal species such as cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, dogs and horses. Draft genome sequences are also available, or soon will be, for several important fish species, including cod, rainbow trout, salmon and tilapia. However, the strings of billions of bases (symbolised as four letters A, C, G, T) that constitute these genome sequences are not immediately useful to biological research scientists.
Annotating these draft genome sequences with features such as where the coding and regulatory parts of genes are located, and the bases which differ between individuals within a species (genetic variants) greatly enhances the value and utility of the genome sequence. Visualising the genome sequences complete with annotations in a freely accessible manner further improves the value of the information.
The web-mounted Ensembl genome browser, databases and associated annotation tools have been shown to be powerful and effective means of annotating the complex genomes of animal species including humans, mice and more recently farmed and companion animals.
This project is concerned with improving the quality of genome annotation for farmed and companion animal genomes. International consortia of scientists are using so-called next generation sequencing technologies, not only to sequence the genomes of more economically important species, but also the genomes of multiple individuals for each species of interest and to improve or finish the reference genome sequences for key species. These new sequencing technologies are also being used increasingly in assays, for example, of the extent of gene expression in different cells or under different conditions (transcriptomics) or of the state of the genome (epigenomics). Mapping the sequence read-outs from these assays back to the relevant genome sequence not only provides a genome-wide framework for analysis but also provides further information with which to annotate the genome sequence itself. Thus, there is a recurring need to refresh the genome sequence annotation for important animal species.
We will use the Ensembl system to annotate the genome sequences of key farmed and companion animal species. The resulting annotated genome sequences will be made freely available as resources mounted on the World Wide Web.
A high quality annotated reference genome sequence is a key source of information and critical bioinformatics resource for the effective prosecution of contemporary research in the biological sciences. This key information is valuable not only to academic researchers, but also to scientists working in industry, including those in the animal breeding, animal health and pharmaceutical sectors. However, the value and utility of such bioinformatics resources are critically dependent upon the currency of the resource. Thus, this project is concerned with delivering high quality up-to-date annotated reference genomes for key farmed and companion animal species to enable research on these economically or socially important animal species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>High quality annotated reference genome sequences are essential bioinformatics resources for 21st century biological research.
Draft reference genome sequences have been established for several farmed and companion animal species - chicken, cattle, sheep, goat, pig, turkey, duck, dog, horse, and most recently rainbow trout. In addition draft genome sequences for Atlantic salmon, Indicine cattle and water buffalo will be released in the near future.
However, unannotated genome sequences are not immediately useful to biologists. Similarly, genome assemblies which are incomplete or for which the annotation is dated hinder progress in biological research.
This proposal is concerned with using the Ensembl system to establish high quality annotation of the genomes of farm and companion animal species, including poultry and farmed fish, and maintain its currency. We will annotate new or improved genome assemblies for farm and companion animals prioritising the genomes of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, salmon and dogs.
We will acquire sequence data being generated by the research community in experiments to characterise the extent of gene expression in different cells or under different conditions (transcriptomics, RNA-seq) or of the state of the genome (epigenomics, histone marks, methylation states) or to identify transcription start sites (CAGE) or transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-seq). We will use these data to enhance the functional annotation of the target species genomes and to make the resulting annotated genomes freely available to the research community via Ensembl. Similarly, we will acquire data that provide evidence for genetic variation within species - SNPs, indels and structural variants - and display the variation in its genomic context. We will generate comparative genomics resources including pairwise genome alignments and gene trees.
We will provide training in the use of the Ensembl genome browser and associated tools.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
The primary beneficiaries from this proposed development and maintenance of Ensembl resources for farmed and companion animals will be researchers in academia and industry in the UK and beyond. The access statistics and citations of Ensembl papers provide evidence of the demand for Ensembl resources from the research community.
Research on domesticated animals has important socio-economic impacts, including underpinning and accelerating improvements in the animal sector of agriculture, contributing to medical research by providing animal models, improving animal health and welfare and informing understanding of natural and wild animal populations.
The world's leading animal breeding and aquaculture breeding companies, of which some of the largest are UK companies, have in-house genetics expertise. Thus, these companies have the expertise to exploit the information captured and disseminated through Ensembl resources.
Evidence of the value of animal genome sequences to the pharmaceutical sector is provided by their recent investments in sequencing pig and dog genomes.
Suppliers of species specific 'omics tools such as expression arrays, SNP chips and proteomics system will benefit from access to annotated genomes sequences which include links to features (e.g. probes) on their products.
There are potential indirect benefits to the wider public through the addressing of the food security agenda as discussed below.

How will they benefit?
The proposed enhanced Ensembl resources, especially the genetic variation resources, will enable research to dissect the genetic control of economically important (and complex) traits in farmed animals including feed efficiency and susceptibility to infectious diseases. In companion animals such as dogs these resources will enable the identification of the determinants of inherited diseases.
This enabling of genetics research in farmed animals and fish will facilitate advanced genetic improvement for these species. Genetic improvement of farmed animal species is a key means of addressing the food security agenda for the animal agriculture and aquaculture sectors.
In companion animals the benefits will be improved tools for selective breeding to minimise inherited diseases and inbreeding and to improve animal welfare.
The utility of 'omics technology products such as expression microarrays and SNP chips is greatly enhanced when the features on these products can be linked to a well-annotated genome sequence and other information sources. For example, probe sets for Affymetrix arrays and SNPs on Affymetrix and Illumina chips can be linked to annotated genes and genome locations respectively, thus enabling more effective use of these products. Well-annotated genomes facilitate the design of capture probes for exome sequencing; current developers of such products include Agilent and Roche Nimblegen. 
Academic and other researchers will benefit from the ability to link the read-out from assay by sequence assays to an annotated genome sequence. Without such a frame of reference such assays are of limited value.
The impacts on research will be delivered within the timeframe of the proposed project to enhance Ensembl resources for farmed and companion animals and continue thereafter. Maintaining the currency of the genome assemblies and the associated annotation is critical to ensuring that these impacts continue to be effective. The indirect impacts, for example, on the food security agenda and hence the benefits to the agriculture and aquaculture sectors and the wider public will take longer to be felt. However, the time to impact for genetic tests for susceptibility to inherited or infectious diseases in animals with their positive impacts on animal welfare can be short - 1 to 3 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>470365</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>EMBL-EBI collaboration with the Functional Analysis of ANimal Genomes (FAANG) Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F8E19B8-7AED-4F8F-A76A-EA177552EC7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is still in the early stages, and we are aiming to get funding for this work.

The project results have been useful if anchoring the new improved pig reference genome sequence to chromosomes and confirming the order and orientation for each chromosomal sequence.
The results of the study have been published by O'Connor et al. Isolation of subtelomeric sequences of porcine chromosomes for translocation screening reveals errors in the pig genome assembly.

The Consortium is coordinating genome-wide analysis, annotation and publication. 
The sequence data from which this assembly was constructed largely comprise 65x genome coverage in whole genome shotgun (WGS) Pacific Biosciences long reads (Pacific Biosciences RSII, with P6/C4 chemistry). Illumina HiSeq2500 WGS paired-end and mate pair reads were used for final error correction using PILON. Sanger and Oxford Nanopore sequence data from a few CHORI-242 BAC clones were used to fill gaps. All the WGS data were generated from a single Duroc female (TJ Tabasco, also known as Duroc 2-14) which was also the source of DNA for the CHORI-BAC library. 
Sscrofa11 replaces the previous assembly, Sscrofa10.2, which was largely established from the same Duroc 2-14 DNA source.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8B8A7001-78FD-4B0B-A0C5-3B98750E6D35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Sscrofa11 assembly has been updated recently to Sscrofa11.1 by the addition of the SSCY sequence data from Skinner et al. 2016 (Genome Res 26:130-9). The BAC and fosmid clone resource from Duroc 2-14 will facilitate further targeted sequence closure. These improved genome assemblies will be a key resource for research in pigs and will enable applications in agriculture and biomedicine.

This website comprises full annotation of the sheep reference genome assembly using the Ensembl automatic annotation system. Protein-coding models were generated by aligning vertebrate protein sequences from UniProt to the repeat-masked genome and by using RNA-Seq data provided by the ISGC. The final gene set includes models from both the UniProt alignments and the RNAseq data. It comprises 20921 protein-coding models, 3985 small noncoding RNAs and 291 pseudogenes.
The ISGC RNA-Seq data set includes a range of tissue samples shared between a trio: ram, ewe and their lamb. In total, we aligned 800 GB data from 89 tissue samples to the sheep genome assembly. This RNA-Seq data set is larger than for any other species in Ensembl.
The Ensembl website for sheep also includes pairwise genome alignments with human, cow and pig. Users can view the indexed BAM files, tissue-specific gene models and the full set of splice junctions (introns) identified by the RNA-Seq pipeline alongside the sheep gene set on the Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org/Ovis_aries. We also provide gene orthologues, cross-references to external databases, and variations from dbSNP and selected genotyping chips.
