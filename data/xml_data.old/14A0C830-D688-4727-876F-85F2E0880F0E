This &amp;quot;Syntegron&amp;quot; platform enables rapid assembly of multiple standardized DNA modules into large assemblies such as metabolic pathways and to exchange individual parts of assemblies (e.g., regulatory elements) to allow variation and optimization. We propose to build on these core technologies to develop a comprehensive experimental and computational toolkit enabling the rapid generation of important biomolecules:
Objective 1: Develop Syntegron &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot; enabling the discovery and production of diverse, valuable biomolecules. An important source for drug leads has been plant natural products but many of these drugs are produced in miniscule amounts in their native hosts, making the drugs expensive and environmentally taxing to harvest. Organic chemistry methodologies have been widely used to synthesize pharmaceuticals but many natural pharmaceutically-relevant scaffolds cannot be achieved by these methods. An alternative is the use of enzymes to enable the production of drug candidates from inexpensive, green starting materials. The goal of this research is to synthesize a variety of natural product variants e.g. terpenes using the Syntegron technology platform constructed in the first phase of funding, and to manufacture these natural product variants for drug discovery applications. We will 1) Take advantage of the recently described phenomena of plant metabolic gene clusters to identify genes encoding enzymes involved in plant secondary metabolite pathways via the development of novel bioinformatic and data mining tools. 2) Use the Syntegron platform to assemble the synthetic metabolic pathways for natural products e.g. the triterpenes and enzymes that will decorate them with functional groups to synthesize a variety of natural product variants. 3) Develop new Syntegron host strains for metabolic engineering 4) Engineer in vivo biosensors for natural products and their variants and use these sensors in high throughput screens allowing dynamic optimization of metabolic pathways.
Objective 2: Develop analytical tools, methods, and conceptual insights enabling the optimisation of diverse multigenic functions using Syntegron technology. Cell-free technology is useful for decoupling intracellular biochemical transformations from confounding experimental factors including cellular toxicity and mass transfer limitations. This has proven useful for quantitatively characterizing fundamental synthetic biology &amp;quot;parts&amp;quot;. The relationship between cell-free parts characterization and performance in vivo remains unclear, and remains a fundamentally important scientific question. We propose to extend cell-free approaches to the high-throughput characterization of multi-genic assemblies constructed using the Syntegron platform, and to compare them with performance in vivo. The development of the Syntegron platform into a true technology for the synthetic biology community requires the development of novel computational modelling frameworks and quantitative tools for analysing and performing Syntegron-based directed evolution. We will therefore 1) develop a quantitative computational modelling framework describing Syntegron-based diversification and selection. 2) Optimise Syntegron-based directed evolution using in silico simulations paired with experiments. The ultimate test of the combined experimental and computational Syntegron platform will be to perform, analyse, and ultimately guide Syntegron-based directed evolution of a model metabolic pathway. We will initially pair in silico simulation with computational optimization to explore the influence of tuneable experimental parameters on the predicted chances of (a) generating sufficient genetic diversity to sample many potentially functional syntegron configurations, and (b) successfully selecting for variants that exhibit optimised biosynthesis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will provide new scientific advances and state of the art techniques in: a) Tools for rapid strain improvement and pathway engineering. b) Synthetic engineered organisms for efficient production of high-value products. c) A novel synthetic biology toolbox of genes, regulatory elements and vectors which will be made freely available to the Synthetic Biology community for future research via Open Wetware. 
We will fully engage with the Knowledge Transfer Networks and invite a member of the Bioscience for Business KTN to an annual Project Management. The impact on academic beneficiaries will be realized by communicating the outputs from this project through regular publication in high-impact peer-reviewed journals, at conference talks.
The strength of the Syntegron Platform is that it is a generic technology for Synthetic Biology applications. We will seek interest from companies in application areas such as, Pharmaceuticals, Industrial chemicals and Agriculture via research collaborations and access to IP and know-how via licensing deals. We anticipate that the technology developed here could form the basis for a start-up company. To do so, all PI's will disclose any technology to their institution's intellectual property offices, which will file patents on the technologies. These will then be proactively licensed to either large companies or to small, venture-backed start-ups. 
An exciting aspect of Synthetic Biology is that it encourages collaboration and multidisciplinary approaches to research, and it is important that the community develops people who want to engage with these diverse ideas and technologies. This project will provide an excellent training experience for the PDRAs employed on the grant and associated PhD studentships. The multidisciplinary collaborations will help them expand their scientific knowledge and experience. Each of the partner institutions have extensive staff development programmes which the PDRAs will be encouraged to make use of.
The PIs are actively involved in a number of outreach programmes, and have delivered talks to diverse audiences including schools, youth organizations such as the cub scouts, lawyers, political parties, journalists and the general public about our research. We plan to continue these outreach activities and look for new opportunities including participating in activities with the SAW trust. The Science Art and Writing (SAW) Trust (see www.sawtrust.org) established in 2005 has a strong track record for taking real research topics into communities in accessible and inclusive ways. Exploring topics through practical science, creative writing and visual arts enables individuals with diverse learning styles and interests to participate in activities that inform on directions of scientific investigations and their relevance to society. The SAW Trust, working with the Syntegron consortium over 3 years would provide training to scientists from each of the 6 member labs in the design of novel projects working with local artists and writers that are delivered locally to engage communities with research into engineering biological systems. 
Sponsored by the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, Jay Keasling and colleagues sponsor approximately 10 high school students each year at JBEI to learn basic synthetic biology. These students come from economically disadvantaged families in Richmond and Oakland, CA. The students learn about synthetic biology in a laboratory setting over a 10-week period. In addition, they get help with college preparation, including their college essay. After five years of this program, nearly all students choose to go to college. This year a student from our first class graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, the premier public education institution in the US. We will continue to work with these students through this funding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1416353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Norwich Science Festival John Innes Centre Exhibit 22.10.16</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F2D2DF6-F6CC-49A1-94C6-B6E5FDF3EC99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Norwich Science Festival. 

The interactive 'Power of Plants' stand from the Latitude Festival made another appearance at the first Norwich Science Festival with Katrin Geisler coming over from Cambridge University to join JIC scientists Michael Stephenson, Hannah Griffiths, Colette Matthewman, Zhenhua Liu, Nadiatul Radzman, Dorota Jakubczyk, Don Nguyen, Miriam Walden, Jenni Rant and Roger Castells-Graells for two days as part of the Norwich Research Park's 'solving problems with science' weekend. A new addition to the stand was developed by Roger who introduced visitors to the structure of viruses through his challenge to build a giant virus particle. Plants are being used to produce virus particles for use as vaccines and so for visitors this deeper look at viruses in combination with a hands-on experience of mock infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with water enabled the scientists to explain the techniques involved and exactly what is being made by plants in this system. People were very interested in the variety of science on display and asked lots of questions. It was good to showcase our research at the first Norwich Science Festival and to show people locally how far reaching the work taking place in essentially a rural county can be in terms of impact to societies across the globe.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1abd9be82b5.72057106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://norwichsciencefestival.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Great British Bioscience Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D1A72E2-723C-4CA3-85F0-0C12E36FBC21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were successful in a winning a BBSRC science communication award to develop a new science stand called 'Nature's Factories' to run at local events and as part of the BBSRC's Great British Bioscience Festival showcasing the best of British bioscience in its 20th anniversary year. 
Human evolution is tightly linked to our use of plants for food, building materials, fuel, medicines etc., and we continue to look for innovative ways to use natural resources to provide us with sustainable solutions that support our lifestyles. Scientific research is enabling us to discover and develop new plant products that improve our lifestyles by creating better medicines, healthier foods and greener technologies whilst also demonstrating the importance of protecting plant species diversity and ecosystems. 
The Nature's Factories stand was designed to enable the public to find out how science is exploring and exploiting the valuable variety of chemicals made by plants as well as making natural remedies to take away and pick leaves from our fact-tree.

We took the stand to the Science in Norwich Day at the Forum in Norwich (1st June 2014), to the Cambridge Botanic Gardens (19th August 2014) and on the 12th November 2014 used the stand for a training workshop for EU scientists to learn how to create interactive displays for public events. On 14-16 November 2014, our exhibit headed to Museum Gardens, Bethnal Green, London to be showcased at BBSRC's Great British Bioscience Festival. The festival, delivered in partnership with London Science Festival was open to the general public and free to attend.
Since then the exhibit has featured at the Bury St Edmunds family science festival (21st March 2015), the Fascination of Plants day at the John Innes Centre (14th May 2015), the Festival of Plants at Cambridge Botanic Gardens (16th May 2015) and at the Youth Stem Awards (13th January 2016).

The image library has the potential to attract new traffic to the NRP institute websites and research group homepages and will allow groups such as the media, schools, the general public and other researchers to gain a glimpse of the great depth and diversity of research that is being carried out in Norwich. Although all the images are freely available to download and use, people are required to sign up to use the library and are asked to enter information at the time of download about their intended use of the image. This helps to capture who is using the library and where the images are being used. So far images have been downloaded 582 times and have been used in presentations, publications, on websites, for education and advertising. We ran an image competition to raise awareness across the NRP site and then assembled a judging panel to select the top 12 images which were used to create an NRP calendar for 2016. The calendar was sent to politicians, business leaders, industry and academics at institutions in the UK and internationally. The competition featured in the local paper, the Eastern Daily Press and an overall winner was picked and used to make a large canvas which is hanging in the new Centrum building. We have received many positive comments about the libraries ease of use for finding good quality, copyright free images to use in presentations from fellow researchers across the site. In October 2016 we put on a two-week, large scale image exhibition at the Forum in Norwich as part of the first Norwich Science Festival. The images attracted a lot of interest and several artists have been in touch with scientists whose research images were on display to set up new collaborations using science to inform artistic practice.

This approach to engaging children in current scientific research in an accessible way provides an excellent tool for scientists who wish to use diverse methods to showcase the potential impacts of their research. Working in teams with professionals from the arts fuels creative thinking and innovation around engagement styles whilst also providing novel science themes for artistic interpretation. Working with teachers helps to inform knowledge on current research to provide new examples for use in the classroom and the whole process enables co-learning from a science starting point in a multi-disciplinary way.

Led by Jenni Rant from the SAW Trust, Michael Stephenson, Colette Matthewman, Marc Jones and Dorota Jakubczyk (JIC) worked with Paolo Bombelli, Katrin Geisler (Cambridge University), Brenda Parker (UCL) and Marin Sawa (Imperial) to deliver a 3-day OpenPlant exhibit entitled &amp;quot;The Power of Plants&amp;quot; in the wildlife, weird science and adventure area at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, from 14-17 July 2016. The exhibit showcased the potential applications of synthetic biology in plants in a hands-on and accessible way. The first day was dedicated to hosting organised school groups where children spent 40 minutes with us experimenting with a variety of plants to learn how scientists are using them in new and novel ways. The second and third day were run as a drop-in style to cater for family groups giving opportunities to engage with children and adults. Visitors were very interested to see science research straight from the labs and amazed by new innovations being developed through synthetic biology. The event was very tiring but the opportunity to work as a team with members from different institutes on a shared science theme was very enjoyable and rewarding whilst also expanding our understanding of each others work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1ad1a3fc0b8.12953058</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.latitudefestival.com/stage/wildlife-weird-science-adventure</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science in Norwich day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA2053E4-13FA-47EB-8EF5-3F4E7379AF29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helped Jenni Rant (SAW) to hold a stand describing the scientific research ongoing at JIC, at the Science in Norwich Day at the Forum on the 1st of June 2014 .</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd69b7098c85.29739219</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://soin.org.uk/2014/04/science-in-norwich-day-2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This is new follow on funding derivative of grant EP/H019154/1.
