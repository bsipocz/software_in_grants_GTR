VWF is unusual in that it is made in the cells lining blood vessels known as endothelial cells (EC), whereas almost all other blood-clotting proteins are made within the liver. Once it is made, VWF is released into the circulation, deposited in the blood vessel wall or stored in EC. VWF is a very large molecule and circulates in a rolled-up bundle. 
Once a blood vessel has been damaged, VWF can attach to structures in the blood vessel wall that are normally hidden but which have now become exposed. The effect of blood flowing past the VWF causes the rolled-up molecule to unravel allowing it to capture circulating cell fragments, called platelets, from the blood. More and more platelets are captured at this site of blood vessel injury and stick together, forming a platelet plug. This is the first step in forming a blood clot to stop blood loss. However, VWF and platelets can also cause blood vessel damage by sticking to the vessel wall. 
Heart disease and stroke, collectively known as cardiovascular disease (CVD), remain the leading cause of death in the United Kingdom. They result in part from formation of abnormal blood clots within the circulation and high levels of VWF are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, at present it is not clear whether the high levels play a role in causing the blood clots or whether they simply result from damaged vessels which have responded by making more VWF. Nonetheless, it has been shown in animal studies that VWF plays a direct role in the formation of the fatty deposits that build up in the blood vessels before a heart attack or stroke. One of the first steps in the formation of a fatty deposit is the attachment of platelets to the EC of the blood vessel wall. 

A deficiency of VWF activity results in a bleeding disorder known as von Willebrand Disease (VWD). It might be predicted that people with VWD would have fewer heart attacks and strokes than people with normal or high levels. 
So far, there are few research studies in animals and humans attempting to answer this question and they have given conflicting results. Recently, improved understanding of how VWF is made and functions has indicated why these studies are flawed. This improved understanding has come from our studies of VWF within the EC from normal controls and from patients with VWD. In brief, these studies show that VWF has a profound effect on the way these cells grow and the effect is not closely related to the resulting level in the blood. 
From these various lines of evidence we have strong reasons to suspect that VWF plays an important role in heart attack and stroke. The drawback of these studies to date is that they do not show how the VWF does this and whether it is primarily VWF circulating in our blood or VWF stored within the EC that is responsible. This distinction is essential if we want to target VWF for therapy in the prevention and treatment of CVD.
Animal models are imprecise and incomplete models of human cardiovascular disease and population studies are oversimplified. We propose to overcome these problems by using human endothelial cells isolated from normal and VWD patients to study directly the interaction between VWF, EC, the damaged blood vessel wall and platelets. Moreover, whilst growing these cells in special chambers, we can reproduce the stresses that they are exposed to in the normal or abnormal circulation: this is likely to be a major determinant of how VWF is made by EC and how it captures platelets. 
Better understanding of these crucial interactions at the beginning of vascular disease, would allow us to target accurately new treatments to prevent heart attacks and strokes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This study will use an in vitro system to study the role of VWF in platelet capture by endothelial cells(EC) and thus its role in atherogenesis. Epidemiological studies of patients with CVD or genetic defects of VWF addressing this have given conflicting results. Animal studies have been suggestive but again incomplete. A novel aspect of this proposal is the use of primary (progenitor) endothelial cells cultured from peripheral blood and mutant VWF. We previously showed that these cells synthesise, store and release VWF in a physiological manner and that they provide a unique demonstration of how defects in VWF synthesis affect the function and behavior of endothelial cells. Moreover, using state of the art perfusion systems and bespoke perfusion chambers with differing geometries we are able to reproduce the patterns of flow encountered in vivo and which appear to be a major determinant of plaque formation. Indeed a key theme throughout this study is the importance of shear in VWF biology: both for synthesis and for function. Variable distribution of VWF within the vascular tree in part reflects these differences in flow and is reflected in their different susceptibility to atheroma. This study will provide precise detail on this relationship and map VWF expression through narrowed and branching vessels where turbulent flow can produce large changes in shear over small distances. 
The critical measure in all cases will be platelet capture on the surface of the EC and a secondary measure will be evidence of resulting EC activation. In both cases the key question will be whether this is mediated by circulating VWF or by VWF emerging from the EC. Our experimental approach is designed specifically to give a precise answer to this question in a physiologically representative system, but also determine mechanisms and consequences for EC.The answers will be potentially crucial factors in planning to exploit the central position of VWF for therapeutic effect.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The burden of cardiovascular disease on the health of the world's population is well recognised. In the UK alone diseases of the heart and circulatory system remain the leading cause of mortality, accounting for almost 200,000 deaths each year. Currently, over 3 million Britons suffer from CVD. The economic consequence of these figures is immense with annual costs exceeding &amp;pound;30 billion. As a result of advances in health care and the launch of the National Health Service, the life expectancy within the UK has risen from 66 years for men and 71 years for women in 1948 to 77.2 years and 81.5 years, respectively, today. However, the incidence of CVD increases steeply with age. 10 million people in the UK are over 65 years old and this will have nearly doubled to 19 million by 2050. CVD burden is therefore projected to grow during the next decade. 
The potential economic and societal impacts of this project are therefore very large. 

By increasing our knowledge of the critical interactions between VWF, the endothelium and platelets we will open the way for the exploitation of VWF's central role in vascular biology, attracting Research &amp;amp; Development into a novel therapies for the prevention and management of CVD. Because these therapies will have the potential to prevent the development of CVD as well as intervene in acute or advanced disease, we hope ultimately to improve social welfare, enhance quality of life, health and the well being of the global nation.
 
The primary beneficiaries of the proposed work will be both patients with cardiovascular disease and importantly those at risk of CVD. Additional, although less numerous, beneficiaries will be those with cardiovascular disease and coexisting von Willebrand Disease who present difficult management problems. It will also aid immediate and long-term treatment decisions for patients with von Willebrand Disease experiencing an acute ischaemic event. 
The increased understanding of VWF's role in vascular biolog and of VWF defects at a cellular level is likely to benefit physicians in a number of related areas including cardiology, stroke, hypertension and inflammatory diseases as well as haematology itself. I intend that the results will have applicability to cardiovascular and hematological medical practice at an international level and will provide an evidence base for clinicians who manage patients with cardiovascular disease and VWD. It will inform decision makers on healthcare policy for patients. 
An important aspect of this work will be fostering collaborative work between haematology and vascular medicine, developing expertise in complementary areas within both departments and improving patient care and research innovation. 
Finally, the undertaking of this project will enable me to gain many useful research skills, including literature review, critical appraisal, laboratory skills and leadership and management, all of which are transferrable to my clinical work as a haematologist and allowing me to make a personal impact on the development of haematology and healthcare both now and through training of future specialists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240620</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M018342/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
