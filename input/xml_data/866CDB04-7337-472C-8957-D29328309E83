The first decades of film exhibition in the UK were characterized by flux and experimentation. This is true of the technologies under development and the location in which exhibitions/performances took place, which included churches, music halls, fairgrounds, theatres and, later, purpose-built venues. Musical and sonic practices were often improvisatory. The consumption of film was also more heterogeneous during this period. Elements of performativity and contingency continued well into the sound era given that in many cinemas live musical performance long remained a key part of film exhibition. \n\nAlthough colleagues in other countries, notably the United States, have begun to excavate this history, in the United Kingdom this history remains largely buried but for a handful of otherwise excellent publications. This Network seeks not only to provide a scholarly rallying point for relevant research in the UK, but to contribute towards a new understanding and appreciation of the performative dimension of film exhibition. It will consider not only historically conscious perspectives but also contemporary practices: silent films are now often re-imagined by live performers in contemporary styles, in what might be described as a post-modern appropriation of film's historically performative mode. Understanding early film's sonic and performative dimensions thus remains a vital part of contemporary British musico-cinematic practice.\n\nThe Network seeks to foster understanding of both historical and (post)modern accompanying trends and to influence future strategy in major exhibition spaces by involving not only individual researchers and performers, but also pre-eminent venues and festivals that feature silent and early film screenings: Nottingham Silent Film Festival and London's Barbican Centre. The Network also seeks to foster an appreciation of the material heritage of music's role in early film exhibition in the UK by involving members of organisations such as the Cinema Organ Society and the British Film Institute. The potential interactions between those in the academy and a broad spectrum of policy-makers, practitioners and other stakeholders will be of unprecedented significance and value.\n\nOur application for an international research network in this field is distinguished by its prioritisation of three key elements:\n- bringing together individuals researching the wide variety of cultural practices involving some form of projected images prior to the development and adoption of synchronized sound in the late 1920s in order to assess the role of music and/or sound in these practices. \n- bringing together individuals whose work in relation to these materials includes (but is not limited to) scholarly research, historically-informed performance practice (i.e. performing/restoring existent scores, and/or improvising), the development of new performing traditions for these materials, archivists, curators, and restorers, and the many enthusiasts and collectors who undertake research outside of the academy. Here, 'materials' may include the films, scores, instruments/equipment, and forms of documentation of the industry or of the experience of film exhibition.\n- bringing to the UK a select body of key individuals whose work has provided a full and rich picture of the US situation in this period, to share their knowledge and expertise and to assist members of the network to foster the further development of research in music and sound practices in film exhibition during this period in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Phil Carli, the distinguished silent film music historian and conductor, was invited to reconstruct Albert Cazebon's compiled score for Maurice Elvey's The Flag Lieutenant (1926).

research, historically-informed performance practice, the development of new performing traditions for these materials,
archivists, curators, restorers, and the many enthusiasts and collectors who undertake research outside of the academy.
Here 'materials' include the films, scores, instruments/equipment, and various forms of written documentation of the industry or of the experience of film exhibition. Within months of starting the Network, the PI uncovered a number of British scores that were not previously known to have survived. One of these was recreated within the lifespan of the network. One other was recreated a couple of years later, and subsequently recorded for a DVD restoration of the original film print, and published by the British Film Institute. 

We did not anticipate just how much we would learn from the experience: insights into the many practical contingencies facing a conductor of original scores, as well as into a films' original reception, for example. Additionally, the
opportunity to trial different approaches to screen accompaniment at the two workshops, using expert practitioners, revealed types of embodied and performance-based knowledge to which we would otherwise have had limited, if any, access. At the first workshop we explored speaking to/lecturing to the screen, performing sound effects live, as well as the difficulties of constructing a history of these practices from surviving documents. We also explored practices prior to attempts to systematize accompaniment, such as accompaniment by song title, using 'random' music, and playing for laughs/'film funning', and compared these with early 'methods', such as the 'Phototune', and using collections of photoplay ('mood') music. We also attempted to reimagine in practice the original live stage prologue (to Cecil Hepworth's 1923 film, 'Comin' Thro' the Rye'), which involved not only trialling particular acting and musical performance solutions, but grappling with the sketchy nature of surviving accounts of the prologue.

An important edited volume was also produced as a result of this network, and has been widely and extremely positively reviewed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Silent Film Festivals and other exhibition venues for silent film might pay greater attention to the wide range of historical performance modes for silent film in order to expand their offerings from the default single improvising pianist. They might take forward the knowledge that university Music Departments may contain a great deal of expertise and performer willingness to stage such performances, even if the film archives and exhibition venues themselves face funding pressures.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>369DF6C1-E299-4BD9-AC09-1175079B550A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463920168b4f4.16053275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D91678F8-4C2C-487A-B696-51E35DD95A2A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sounds of the Silents in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d99186fe36784093a89ae67dc4a70fcb"><gtr:id>d99186fe36784093a89ae67dc4a70fcb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199797615</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5448150c9bfb54.97379788</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E2EC14B2-31D1-490A-AEAA-7D734078B5AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sounds of the Silents in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01d0bafa39fce4548189f214d305867e"><gtr:id>01d0bafa39fce4548189f214d305867e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davison A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199797615</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544816941d4d64.07336903</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>667D2CE3-8BCA-44BB-8DFC-171C340C8AC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sounds of the Silents in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8634e4cda181cef93cd949a057470df6"><gtr:id>8634e4cda181cef93cd949a057470df6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Julie Brown</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199797615</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544815d2d8d603.75579259</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G000492/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>54D637A1-400F-4B2B-8FB4-48DF799C853C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Popular Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
