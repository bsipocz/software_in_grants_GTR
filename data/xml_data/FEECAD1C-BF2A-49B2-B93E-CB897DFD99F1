The early post-Kantians include figures such as J.B. Erhard, P.J.A. Feuerbach, the early J.G. Fichte, F. Gentz, S. Maimon, J. M&amp;ouml;ser, A.W. Rehberg, E. Reimarus, K.L. Reinhold, the early F.W.J. Schelling, F. Schlegel, and T. Schmalz. 

The early post-Kantians wrote in the aftermath of Kant's pathbreaking contributions to moral philosophy-the 1785 Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the 1788 Critique of Practical Reason. These works were widely regarded as inaugurating a revolution in practical philosophy: In opposition to previous philosophers, Kant argued that the principles of morality were not to be sought in an innate moral sense or in the commands of a transcendent God, but in human rationality and freedom. Although Kant inaugurated a revolution, he did not - at least not initially - fully explain its implications for the 'philosophy of right' (legal and political philosophy) or provide an unambiguous account of its implications for political practice. The early post-Kantians saw it as their task to complete Kant's revolution in practical philosophy by deepening his account of morality and by developing an authentically Kantian legal and political philosophy. 

In order to discharge this task, the early post-Kantians had to grapple with several issues. First, they had to determine the true nature and significance of Kant's contribution to moral theory. Secondly, they had to adopt a position concerning the relationship between the norms and principles of Kantian morality and the norms and principles of legal and political philosophy. Thirdly, they had to take a stance on an issue that greatly concerned Kant-namely, the nature of the relationship between theory and practice. Finally, they had to confront two questions of burning poltical import: Do the principles of Kantian moral theory justify a right to revolution, or do they rather rule it out? What are the implications of Kant's moral theory for human rights, and for the rights of women and non-Europeans? In tackling these issues, the early post-Kantians produced a body of rich and sophisticated work that is of enduring philosophical importance.

The practical philosophy of the early post-Kantians has been relatively neglected in Anglophone history of philosophy. However, this is beginning to change. Thanks in part to the work of scholars such as Frederick Beiser and Reidar Maliks, there has been a recent growth of interest in early post-Kantian practical philosophy. The proposed network seeks to build upon, and further develop, this interest by bringing together a group of international scholars to explore the nature, significance, and contemporary relevance of early post-Kantian practical philosophy. This collaborative exploration will not only deepen our understanding of early post-Kantian practical philosophy; it will also deepen our understanding of 18th and 19th Century German philosophy and open up new avenues for research in the history of political thought and in legal and political theory. 

The proposed network will explore the nature and significance of early post-Kantian practical philosophy through a series of four themed workshops, each of which will address one or more of the aforementioned issues. The workshops will also explore the implications of early post-Kantian practical philosophy for contemporary Kant scholarship and for contemporary debates in legal and political theory. 

The network will be complemented and supported by a series of translations of early post-Kantian practical philosophy. These translations, which will be published over the course of the project, will enable a wider audience to engage critically with the literature that will be explored by the research network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are four primary beneficiaries outside of the academic research community:

1) Members of the public with an interest in politics or in German politics, history, and culture.
2) The Goethe-Institut London.
3) The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne ('The Lit &amp;amp; Phil'). 
4) The Mercantile Library of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Members of the public with an interest in politics or in German politics, history, and culture will benefit from the proposed research in at least two ways: 

i) In popular presentations of the period, eighteenth century German political thought is often associated with 'organicist' conceptions of the state and with the emergence of a pernicious form of nationalism. Such associations have contributed to the unfortunate and misleading impression that post-Kantian practical philosophy anticipates, and is perhaps even congenial to, the political doctrines of National Socialism. The proposed research aims to provide a corrective to this misleading image by showing that many of the ideas of the early post-Kantians are consistent with progressive, liberal thought. The first way in which the proposed research will benefit interested members of the public, then, is that it will give them a more nuanced understanding of eighteenth century German political thought and culture. 

ii) The network's impact activities will endeavour to show that the ideas of the early post-Kantians can shed much-needed critical light on contemporary social and political issues. As a consequence, interested members of the public should acquire a deeper sense of the relevance of early post-Kantian thought to contemporary social and political issues, as well as an enhanced understanding of those issues. 

The institutional beneficiaries identified in (2)-(4) will benefit from collaborating with the research network to stage public lectures because such collaboration will help to further each institution's goals. These are: to provide information about German 'cultural, social and political life' and to 'encourage intercultural dialogue' (The Goethe-Institut); 'to educate the people of Newcastle and the surrounding area' (The Lit &amp;amp; Phil); 'to make a difference through literature and ideas, advancing interest in the written word, and celebrating the best in literary achievement' (The Mercantile Library).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37871</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R001847/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>70D3926D-4C45-43CC-AA9D-488DC64E8A9A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Ideas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>963920AE-7577-4234-BB09-8B2D1C1FB695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB13D4DA-F283-46AB-8BD6-B86DAEB82726</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Jurisprudence/Legal Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33E5E05F-68BD-4527-AEE5-B1E47B0D67FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
