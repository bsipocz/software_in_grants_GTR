The first is the Bionanotechnology IRC based in Oxford and led by Professor John Ryan (EP ref GR/R45659/01). The IRC aims to investigate biomolecular systems, from the level of single molecules up to complex molecular machines, to establish the principles of their function and apply this knowledge to produce artificial electronic and optical devices: Molecular motors are proteins in which enzymatic activity such as energy conversion and self-assembly are integrated to produce highly efficient linear or rotary motion on a nanometre length scale. The combination of structural biology, molecular genetics and biophysics will allow the mechanisms to be characterised and potential applications to be identified. Membrane proteins can be viewed as one of evolutions main attempts at nano-engineering: they include ion channels, hormone receptors and photoreceptors. High resolution (spatial and temporal) studies of ion channels and related membrane proteins will be made via novel time-resolved optical spectroscopy and single molecule techniques. Molecular genetic analysis needs efficient ways of comparing sequences: to search for mutations it is necessary to scan entire gene sequences. Combined nano-fabrication and genetics methods will be used to produce patterned surfaces, and more sensitive methods of detecting interactions will be developed in order to push toward the single molecule limit. Single-molecule electronics and photonics will be used to develop novel devices, networks and sensors. Single molecule and scanning probe experimental techniques including AFM, STM, optical and dielectric traps, FTIR, and SNOM will underpin the entire IRC programme. Theoretical approaches with common themes will be developed and applied - including Monte Carlo methods, atomic force models, and techniques derived from semiconductor device simulations.The second is the IRC in Nanotechnology based in Cambridge and led by Professor Mark Welland (EP ref GR/R45680/01). The Universities of Cambridge and Bristol with University College London will establish an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) in Nanotechnology. The IRC is directed at the very core of nanotechnology and as such will aim to provide an underpinning interdisciplinary activity with the general theme of accurately controlling the physical properties of nanostructures and devices by nanofabrication with single molecule precision. Central to the ethos of the IRC will be the development of research themes and strategies that uniquely combine expertise from currently disparate fields. The consortium will develop the basic tools to organise molecules at the hard/soft interface (the growth of soft molecular structures off hard substrates) by natural and other means, including self-assembly and soft lithography. Characterisation of structural properties of the interface and their inter-relationship with electronic properties is also central, and an appropriate range of tools will be available. This includes scanning-probe methods, optical, fluorescence and electron-beam microscopies, theory and modelling. Such a range of tools and techniques is not found in a single university department, and the purpose of the IRC is to tackle research problems that cut across the traditional divides between all science and engineering disciplines</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>737283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_qA137861</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1A41A859-2076-46E6-B80F-CE4E1E8EDC1D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.5  Resources and infrastructure (underpinning)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
