The proposed SIBs systems would be an invaluable tool for the better understanding long-term tissue/cell culture, particularly where applied to quality assessment. In the academic context, this study will specifically address the need for better technologies for the long term study of cell and tissue engineered constructs that recreate 3D architecture and cell-cell interdependency of the in vivo environment. As such beneficiaries could be envisaged in different fields including regenrative medicine, tissue engineering, disease modelling, analytical science, drug discovery and delivery. In the industrial context, this system could be an excellent model for analysing regenerative medicine products, assessing reproducibility between products, identifying novel therapeutic targets, assessing response to new drug leads as well as investigating toxicity of novel chemicals. Furthermore, the recent introduction of the 7th amendment to the EU Cosmetics Directive, which imposes a phased marketing ban on any products tested on animals, makes the development of such human based model extremely timely.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The award has assisted in the design of some Quasi Vivo bioreactors manufactured by Kirkstall.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C0313EDE-CDE7-4183-8555-771A33EC6413</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b8d3ee100fe9.07244584</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1.
