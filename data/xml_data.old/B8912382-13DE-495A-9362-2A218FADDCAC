The resulting status hierarchy could therefore be seen as legitimately based on individual achievement. Less educated people therefore occupy a low status position for which they can be seen as personally responsible. In this project we investigate the consequences this has for the well-being of less educated people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stigmatised social groups can buffer negative effects on well-being by identifying with their group and building a positive group identity. Less educated people are likely to have difficulty in constructing a positive group identity because it is difficult to construct a positive identity around a negative attribute. It is therefore predicted that less educated people have lower average well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, two factors might buffer this effect. First, if less educated people perceive the class system as illegitimate, this implies that they reject personal responsibility for their situation. Second, if less educated people identify strongly with their own class this creates the potential for a positive group identity. Both mechanisms could reinstate the buffering function of positive group identity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These issues are being investigated using secondary analysis of UK and international survey data.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For academic beneficiaries, please see the section 'Academic beneficiaries'.

Given that the less educated are more likely to be unemployed, ill, depressed, and socially isolated than higher educated people, research aimed at understanding the roots of the poor well-being of lower educated people has the potential to have considerable societal impact. Concretely, the ultimate potential for impact of this research is twofold. First, it might contribute to the knowledge about how social differences in well-being are caused, and it might therefore help to formulate a structural solution for the lower levels of well-being among less educated people. Second, many aspects of well-being are also associated with direct and indirect societal costs. Physical and mental health problems have a direct cost in terms of healthcare, but also an indirect cost as a consequence of the lower economic productivity of people with health problems. This research therefore has a very strong potential impact, but at the same time the impact can only be achieved in the long run. This is because rather than studying each separate symptom of low well-being, this project looks a structural cause of many different forms of low well-being. Structural causes need structural solutions and it is unreasonable to think that these will be reached within the lifetime of or shortly after this project. 

The people who will ultimately benefit from this research are less educated people and policymakers. Less educated people will benefit in terms of higher well-being. Policymakers who are interested in creating a stronger economy, greater well-being, and a fairer and more equal society, will benefit in terms of clear suggestions about the structural causes of social differences in well-being. 

Although we will also communicate with the less educated and with policymakers directly, we anticipate that most impact will be achieved through the involvement of charities and other NGOs working in the domains of inequality, poverty, and education. This is because such organisations are specialised in the theme of our research, and they will be able to relate our findings to their existing knowledge. Crucially, they work directly with both less educated people and policymakers, trying to help the less educated and influence the policymakers to create conditions in which the less educated can be helped. The knowledge generated by the research we propose will offer these organisations new or better tools to achieve those goals. Because we think these organisations will play a crucial role in generating impact, we will try to involve them in the execution of the project at an early stage (see 'Pathways to impact').</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented to 16th Jena Workshop on Intergroup Processes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA3C260B-FDA5-49E2-9E05-62E237C88C36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk stimulated questions and discussion.

One dissemination meeting was held in October 2013, during the lifetime of the project, and was attended by representatives of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW). As a result of this meeting we developed collaborative research plans with the ONS wellbeing division with a view to gaining a finer grained understanding of the relation between educational attainment and wellbeing.

A larger dissemination event was a well-attended one-day conference at the King's Fund in London, on 2 October 2014. 'Making better decisions for public health: Insights from secondary data' was chaired by David Buck, Senior Policy Officer at the King's Fund. Ours was one of 6 projects from the Health and Wellbeing Cluster of the Secondary Data Analysis Phase 1 projects invited to make a presentation at this meeting. We presented the key findings from the project to an audience of policy makers and practitioners in the health and social care sectors. 

Further ways in which the project findings have been disseminated to non-academic audiences are as follows:

1. We wrote a blog for the LSE Politics and Policy website. See http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/education-is-the-basis-of-an-important-social-division/
2. We wrote an Evidence Briefing for the ESRC. See http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/The%20wellbeing%20effect%20of%20education_tcm8-31129.pdf
3. Our research was featured in an article in 'Britain in 2015'. See http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/publications/britain-in/
4. We prepared a case study for the UK Data Service. See http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/use-data/data-in-use/case-study/?id=151
5. We have maintained a project website. See http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/issw/
6. We have had a project-related twitter account: @Cardiff_SDAI

Although it should be clear from the above that our research has been disseminated widely, using a variety of channels, it is not yet clear whether this dissemination has resulted in the findings being used. A paper describing our key findings has been requested by several people working in education, so it seems likely that they will make use of the findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C09D71EA-54FE-4AD6-B760-DE686DC453EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54b233e0d5b1e9.11606540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our results show that the well-being of people with low levels of education suffers from the societal stigma attached to their social position, and that this can manifest itself in a range of attitudes and beliefs which, when applied to whole groups of people, may be harmful to the welfare of societies.
We also found that, although education was more important to people's identities as their level of education increased, it was at least moderately important across all levels of education, including those with no educational qualifications. Finally, our results suggest that identifying with a stigmatised group may not simply buffer against the associated negative effects, as some previous researchers have suggested. In fact, under some circumstances, it may actually be detrimental to members' well-being.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They could be used by educational policy-makers and practitioners to bolster efforts to avoid stigmatising those with low (or no) educational qualifications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E173F5B-9A89-4695-80AD-49539804B887</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b754a10ac795.44711360</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/issw</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>08DF7D8E-7D29-4412-BAC6-97E80C20E404</gtr:id><gtr:title>Life at Both Ends of the Ladder: Education-Based Identification and Its Association With Well-Being and Social Attitudes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personality &amp; social psychology bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24978fb3fd2ac8a796e1c4ade27d80b5"><gtr:id>24978fb3fd2ac8a796e1c4ade27d80b5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kuppens T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0146-1672</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56b755f5d97016.14475017</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B090B19-6B3C-4B26-842B-7C7E75798DF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Education Effect: Higher Educational Qualifications are Robustly Associated with Beneficial Personal and Socio-political Outcomes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Indicators Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/441bf53240d9ac9015a1b733ae3194a7"><gtr:id>441bf53240d9ac9015a1b733ae3194a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Easterbrook M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55004ef3468243.45763584</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K003534/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EFFEC6B1-6BC8-4C9D-9D77-02CEF5E4E301</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
