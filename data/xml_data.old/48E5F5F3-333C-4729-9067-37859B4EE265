provide critical evidence about the usage, experiences and outcomes of different forms of alternative family dispute resolution (AFDR) on relationship breakdown, namely solicitor negotiations, mediation and collaborative law, at a time when these court alternatives are likely to become increasingly used.&amp;nbsp; In particular, it will explore how well known and how widely used each of these processes has become nationally; how positive or negative people's experiences of these processes have been in the short and longer term; what (if any) norms of family dispute resolution are embedded in each of these processes, and with what (if any) impacts on different kinds of users and cases; and whether each process appears to be more or less appropriate for particular kinds of parties.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Project uses a mixed methods approach. First a set of questions on a nationally representative survey will be posed, followed by interviews with lawyers, mediators and parties with experience of different styles of AFDR. Finally, recording and analysis of a selection of mediations, collaborative law processes and lawyer-client interviews will be undertaken. Findings from the three phases will be synthesised in order to arrive at an overall 'map' of family dispute resolution pathways.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>444595</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Justice</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ministry of Justice - Separating Families Campaign</gtr:description><gtr:id>320A119F-88CC-463D-B471-F2DD63B6B071</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Leaflets

They also set up a digital information exchange platform for contributors to work together on and paid for the design and launch of the new leaflets and online materials aimed at raising awareness of family mediation among a wider range of separating couples.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Anne Barlow was invited as a member of the Mapping Research Team to join an MoJ Advisory Group around the Separating Families Campaign aimed at educating the public and separating couples in particular about their dispute resolution options when they couldn't agree arrangements for children. Anne Barlow or another member of the Mapping Team attended 3 meetings leading to the campaign with family mediation providers and other relationship agencies to highlight the dispute resolution option of mediation and advised on the content of the campaign leaflets, drawing on lessons from our research findings around the types of parties or cases where family mediation may not be suitable and flagging the importance of indicating this in the campaign leaflets. In particular, the availability of legal aid and the fact that domestic violence may require a different dispute resolution approach were inserted after we referred to aspects of our research findings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>One Plus One</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>One Plus One</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F69D5D9-937A-4A93-AEE5-0D6323958DA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Production of videos for use as part of the online tool on the One Plus One platform which will be publicly available for use by separating couples as part of their 'Splitting up: put kids first' programme by the end of 2016.
There has been a delay in One Plus One's ability to make the emotional readiness online tool live within their intended programmes for the extraneous reasons outlined above. We are advised it will go live during 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546102c960fda3.26147750-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Following the extension of the project by ESRC to 31/03/15, One Plus One entered into a contract with the project team at the University of Exeter as notified to the ESRC to work with our research team and other experts and service users to develop an online tool to assist parties and practitioners to assess the emotional readiness of parties to participate in resolution of family disputes through family mediation or otherwise. One Plus One had previously developed online educational tools, working with DfE and MoJ in the past and have access to software experts, psychologists and service users.
As per the schedule in the contract One Plus One (OPO) have directly invested a minimum of &amp;pound;15,000 and have carried out the following work:-
Participated in two initial workshops with Mapping Team, OPO staff and OPO Associate experts where it was agreed OPO would develop three short videos to demonstrate the different types of negotiation that separated parents might experience for inclusion in the online tool. This was a part of the wider emotional readiness work that had been discussed in our workshops; 
Carried out a scoping phase followed by scriptwriting and recruitment of actors and experts for the videos;
Shot three videos of alternative forms of dispute resolution which could later be edited and placed within the emotional readiness tool once the three pathways had been designed and tested; 
Undertaken the first editing phase which was completed at the end of July 2015;
Undertook an assessment of emotional states which was then tested for validity and reliability over the summer of 2015; 
Reported on the piloting of the Emotional Readiness tool to the Mapping Research Team and other collaborators involved in the Creating Paths to Family Justice ESRC IAA Social Policy Network in London on 21st July 2015; 
Funded all work after end of March 2015, including initial design of the pathways for the emotional readiness tool, preparation of the formulation of a technical specification ready for commissioning digital development; 
Due to a combination of events including future funding uncertainty and imposed evaluation conditions for One Plus One arising out of Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) requirements not to change OPO online programmes pending evalutation, the plan for the Emotional Readiness Tool to go live as part of the One Plus One portfolio of programmes had to be postponed. However, the Emotional Readiness tool should now go live in mid-2016, with funding authorised by One Plus One regardless of any DWP funding decision due to be notified in April 2016.
Ultimately the tool will be situated on the OPO digital platform and be available for use by separating couples.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our research findings identified the lack of emotional readiness by one party as a key reason why family dispute resolution and family mediation in particular is often unsuccessful. Our data are a rich source of party feedback on the process and why family mediation and other Dispute Resolution processes did or did not work for them, which enabled us to map which parties and cases suit which processes and to work with other agencies to find mechanisms to help identify and address the lack of emotional readiness before dispute resolution is attempted. 
Following the extension of the project by ESRC to 31/03/15, the project team at the University of Exeter entered into a contract with One Plus One as notified to the ESRC to work together with them and with other experts and service users to develop an online tool to assist parties to assess their emotional readiness to attempt to resolve their dispute with their former partner and provide support to enable parties to become emotionally ready to resolve such disputes, through family mediation or otherwise.
At two workshops with One Plus One and through correspondence, we contributed to the development of a series of questions to feed into the online tool to assess emotional readiness for beginning negotiation of family law issues around children on separation, with the aim of resolving issues out of court. A method of working was agreed, whereby One Plus One, building on the findings from our research around the importance of emotional readiness, would take forward the commissioning of short videos and work with software experts, psychologists and service users to develop appropriate material for the online tool. 
The Mapping Paths to Family Justice research team commented on the pilot phase of One Plus One's commissioned work when the developments undertaken for the Emotional Readiness tool were presented at a Creating Paths to Family Justice ESRC IAA award workshop in London on the 21st July 2015.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Justice</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Relate</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3D1D401-DE0E-45EA-BE7A-202FF277F532</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Family mediation leaflet - Family mediation: Sorting out family disputes without going through court, (London: Ministry of Justice, December 2015)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb8de55378d1.50867538-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Relate attracted significant funding from the Google Impact Challenge UK 2014 fund to develop 'Relate Rechtwijzer' (known as 'RR'), an online family mediation platform based on a Dutch model already in operation in The Netherlands.

We met Relate at an Innovation Unit event relating to Family Mediation and cemented our collaboration in our initial ESRC IAA Social Policy Network Award, although they had already been using the Mapping research.

Their Head of Innovation and Development has confirmed to us that our research has been very useful and informative throughout the entire development process. Relate have commented in particular on how it has informed the early stages of our development:

1. it helped them to shape their concept proposal that resulted from their initial Discovery Process (March to October 2014). The research helped to determine the problem statement and key design requirements for their development. Here our rich insights into the experience of people going through separation were particularly helpful to identify gaps in support and unmet needs in the current landscape. This and the quantitative research also helped to inform their initial business case that secured the internal go-ahead for the development.

2. the research helped to drive key workstreams in their Prototyping and Proof of Concept stage (November 2014 - October 2015). This phase was funded through the Google Impact Challenge UK 2014. This rich qualitative research of the Mapping Study helped to inform the OFDR service blue-print and develop user personas. Both are critical for the successful design of a digital service. 

3. The research also helped them to establish and test the viability of developing a sustainable operating model for the service. 

In this way the Mapping Study contributed significantly to the successful proof of concept for the OFDR service.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Relate</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Relate</gtr:description><gtr:id>03FEC0B3-18B3-427A-8CD5-BB23A1118F97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Family mediation leaflet - Family mediation: Sorting out family disputes without going through court, (London: Ministry of Justice, December 2015)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bb8de55378d1.50867538-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Relate attracted significant funding from the Google Impact Challenge UK 2014 fund to develop 'Relate Rechtwijzer' (known as 'RR'), an online family mediation platform based on a Dutch model already in operation in The Netherlands.

Drawing on the preliminary findings of the three year ESRC-funded Mapping Paths to Family Justice research project, this paper will consider the perceived strengths and weaknesses of three forms of out of court family dispute resolution - solicitor negotiation, mediation and collaborative law - as indicated by parties and practitioners. It will go on to consider how far traditional or changing notions of justice are embodied within these different processes. In particular, is the delegated empowerment to reach agreement out of court - now overtly encouraged by recent reforms - displacing the need for such disputes to be negotiated in the shadow of the law? What might this mean longer term for the concept of justice in family matters? The paper will argue that whilst out of court dispute resolution can often be beneficial, more attention needs to be placed on gender and power issues alongside assuring the quality of practitioner. In addition, the presentation of real and appropriate choice of dispute resolution process to parties is critical to its likely success or failure.

The first phase of the project involved a national survey designed to gauge levels of awareness of the three forms of dispute resolution among the general public. Those who had experienced separation or divorce since 1996 were also asked about their use of and satisfaction with these processes. The survey indicated that while mediation is the most widely recognised of the three processes, it is less likely to be taken up when offered to divorcing or separating parties than solicitor-led forms of dispute resolution. Among those who did take up one or more of these dispute resolution options, levels of satisfaction were also higher for solicitor-led processes than for mediation. The second phase of the study, involving semi-structured interviews with parties who have used one or more out-of-court dispute resolution processes, puts flesh on the bones of the survey's statistical findings. In this paper we will present our initial qualitative data on clients' comparative satisfaction with mediation and solicitor-led negotiations to develop an understanding of the benefits and disadvantages, from the client's perspective, of each form of family dispute resolution.

The presentation reports on the preliminary findings of the first phase of this study, a nationally representative omnibus survey examining awareness and experience of three major forms of out of court family dispute resolution (FDR)- mediation, collaborative law and solicitor negotiation. Whilst mediation is the FDR of which most people are aware, it has the lowest satisfaction rate for both process and outcome as judged by those who had experienced family breakdown between 1996-2011. Users were far more positive about process and outcomes for the partisan options of solicitor negotiation and collaborative law. A gender dimension to the findings was noted and will be explored in more depth in phase two of the study. The PI also participated in workshops on domestic violence screening in mediation, discussing best and poor practice that was emerging from Phase 2 of the project.

The presentation was written up for a Review Mailing to all Resolution members. The PI was asked to join Linked In Groups of mediators and other Family Practitioners to debate these issues. It led to participant recruitment for Phase 2 practitioner and client interviews and Phase 3 recording of mediation and co-mediation sessions for the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7604936331.1426122b1770e4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.resolution.org.uk/trainingandevents/events/?e_id=4B1DDFD5-C2D6-4D2B-A985-C647E613278F</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Presentation to London Resolution family law practitioners (solicitors, collaborative lawyers and mediators)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>87137C44-B46A-4D49-BCDC-ACC53AA725A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of research findings with interactive discussion of how to move towards best practice in mediation and collaborative law.

This paper draws on interview data from our ESRC-funded 'Mapping Paths to Family Justice' project. The project as a whole aims to investigate and compare three forms of out-of-court family dispute resolution: solicitor negotiations, mediation and collaborative law. In interviews with parties who have experienced one or more of these forms of dispute resolution, important findings are emerging relating to negative as well as positive aspects of the user experience within all three processes. One theme that has emerged prominently is that entry into mediation appears in many cases to have been far from voluntary. Interviewees have reported that if they are eligible for legal aid, solicitors will not offer the option of solicitor negotiations but simply advise them to attend mediation; that they have been told that they must go to mediation (not simply attend a MIAM) before commencing court proceedings; and that screening for suitability for mediation is perfunctory, with parties not seen separately or asked about any issues of violence in the relationship. The paper documents these experiences and the outcomes of mediation in these cases, and considers the possible implications of these findings in a post-LASPO world.

International comparisons were made by members of the audience which fed into thinking around policy issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-912527843.29701952b17722e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creating Paths to Family Justice Workshop 5 -09/11/16 - Effective signposting of appropriate online information for separating couples</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D9CFCD80-7529-44F1-9FA3-2D89A4B6473B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This discussed plans for the Ministry of Justice's 'Out of Court Pathway' for family dispute resolution and how best to ensure that key information around the need for and tools to help achieve practical and emotional readiness were signposted effectively to separating couples.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5d6bc207c69.54821846</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Plenary Presentation to Kent Family Justice Board Annual Conference - 'Adversarial mythologies: policy assumptions and research evidence in family law - revisited'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>613EBA36-E4FF-4232-BB49-B490B50CE106</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a member of the Kent Family Justice Board, Rosemary Hunter was invited to address the Board's annual conference on recent research in family law relating to current practice issues.

In particular, we continued the series of 5 themed workshops involving key non-academic stakeholders as part of the Impact Accelerator Award, Creating Paths to Family Justice (Creating) between November 2015 and November 2016, in order to shape and influence policy and share and improve best practice relating to relevant digital information and family dispute resolution practice, including publicly funded mediation. 
The Mapping findings were used to inform the configuration of legal information and referral to Relate's Online Family Dispute Resolution (OFDR) following the launch of their beta version modelled on the Dutch system and known as 'Relate Rechtwijzer' (RR). This was evidenced in a letter dated 23 January 2017 from Relate's Head of Innovation and Development, indicating that 'the insightful review of and extensive feedback on the prototype service and the rich discussions you facilitated in the Creating Paths workshops significantly shaped the re-design of the OFDR service. Your focus throughout on bringing in the user insight from the Mapping Paths to Family Justice research was highly effective. It allowed us to put in context and extend the user insight we were gathering in parallel from the user testing of the prototype service. I believe this approach has also embedded a stronger user-centred and evidence-based focus for the expert practitioners and service leaders present in the workshops. It has led to comprehensive and practical improvements of the tool's design itself, of quality assurance procedures in the service management specification, of the practitioner selection and training requirements, of the communication and marketing approaches, and our efforts to find a sustainable social business model that can support affordable access to justice.'
The Mapping findings about poor practices for domestic violence screening in Mediation Information and Assessment Meetings and the involvement of the FMC in the subsequent Creating workshops focusing on joined-up best practice have contributed to the amendment of the FMC Code of Practice for Family Mediators in September 2016 (para. 6.1). This makes explicit that although Assessment Meetings can be conducted jointly or separately, they must include an individual element with each Participant to allow the Mediator to undertake domestic abuse screening. The FMC in their feedback to us in January 2017 indicated that awareness-raising as a result of the collaborative working in Creating has led to additions to their guidance on working online with clients and on screening. One of their member agencies, The Family Mediation Association (FMA) reported that as a result of the Mapping findings and Creating discussions, they are reviewing guidance for their members on screening processes and have scheduled a series of emotional readiness seminars for 2017. In addition, the MoJ Digital team following our Creating workshop on Domestic Violence screening in November 2016 are including our team and the Mapping findings in their domestic violence screening information and training development going forward. 
The Mapping project findings expressed concern about the lack of voice for children in out of court dispute resolution and this has been followed up to good effect in 2016. Our Creating Workshop 4, worked with a team of young people from the Family Justice Young People's Board on how to address the lack of online information for children of separating parents and on confidentiality and access issues for children in this situation. They also shared our ambition to include the voice of the child in out of court Dispute Resolution where children wish to contribute. We co-created ideas which are being taken on board longer term by the MoJ digital team and family mediation practitioners. Some of the FJYPB members attending have since committed themselves to continuing the work and have agreed to take a lead on advocating for the voice of the child to be heard throughout the sector at other key stakeholder events. In addition, Cafcass commended the Creating project in their feedback to the team in January 2017 as a 'pivotal and well timed initiative' which led them to consider the engagement aspects of all their services including information giving and assessment pathways and further developing the 'voice of the child' elements of their service. The FMA indicated that they had reviewed and made changes to their website to help clients and children understand mediation options better and to help young people understand how their voices can be heard in mediation. In addition, the Mapping findings on the marginalisation of children's voices in dispute resolution processes and the involvement of the Family Justice Young People's Board in Creating has led to CAFCASS, MoJ, and DWP agreeing to join together to provide better accessible information and support for children and young people online during parental separation to avoid duplication of effort. 
 Two academic members of the Mapping team were invited to a workshop organised by the MoJ digital and policy teams on 23.03.16 to discuss how to address the Mapping findings on the need for 'practical readiness' prior to mediation through better signposting to and quality of digital information provision. This prompted a typology of users of family justice processes to be developed to assist MoJ in how most effectively to operationalise their plans from a multi-user perspective. The PI was also invited to attend the MoJ 'Family Justice Out of Court Pathway' showcase on 31.08.16 where the Universities of Exeter and Oxford were the only academic partners formally attributed as contributors to the design of the new pathway. The collaborative working between MoJ digital team and the Creating Paths academics and other partners has, they reported to us in January 2017, allowed MoJ 'to engage in open policy making with 3rd sector representatives and family justice academics an ongoing priority for the department and a necessary and important part of the drive for evidence based policy.' The MoJ is currently testing an 'Action Plan' with users and have asked the Creating Academics to give feedback on this when testing is completed in the first quarter of 2017 as well as feedback on the MoJ's signposting strategy. The MoJ digital delivery team are also including the Mapping Academics in their domestic violence screening information and training development going forward. 
We also gave an invited paper at the Resolution Conference on 17.06.16 to 150 family practitioners; 'Creating Paths to Family Justice: A collaborative approach to filling the access to justice gap' as the community wished to know how the Mapping findings were being and could further be taken forward by practitioners. Resolution further reported to us in January 2017 that the Mapping findings on emotional readiness have increased practitioner awareness and led to improvements in the quality of Resolution's materials and the information for the public on the Resolution website. 
We also agreed at a meeting with OnePlusOne on 17.08.16 to review the video clips for the proposed 'emotional readiness' tool. OnePlusOne now plan to launch this in the summer of 2017 and the Creating team plan have written a commentary for use with other aspects of the video material to be hosted on the University of Exeter website. It is also planned to use this co-created material for mediation training purposes with Family Mediators Association and Resolution. 
In terms of engagement with practising family mediators and lawyers, the community continues to invite us to speak at events and the findings from the Mapping project have been reported and commented on by practitioners. Thus mediator Austin Chessell reflected on Barlow's 2015 presentation of the Mapping findings in the context of how he puts some matters identified into his own practice in Divorce Magazine - see https://www.thedivorcemagazine.co.uk/mapping-paths-to-family-justice/. The findings have begun to have international reach through presentation at academic and practitioner conferences on efforts to fill the access to justice gap internationally (e.g. Rosemary Hunter presented at the Research Committee on Sociology of Law, Working Group on Comparative Studies of Legal Professions, Andorra la Vella, July 2016). They continue to have influence regionally (e.g. Barlow and Ewing presented at Resolution: East and West Sussex, Kent and Surrey's Dispute Resolution Day, June 2016 and Hunter's presentation at the Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, Oxford, November 2016). The findings have been reported by family lawyers on their websites (e.g. Farrer and Co.). They continue to be relied upon by those writing in practitioner and academic journal (e.g. Treloar, CFLQ, 2016: 28(2) on screening and Walker, Family Law Journal, January 2017 on legal information and advice) as well as in the leading practitioner handbooks (e.g. Lisa Parkinson (2014) Family Mediation, 3rd edn and Marian Roberts (2014) Mediation in Family Disputes: Principles of Practice, 4th edn) and MoJ reports (e.g. Pereira et al (2015) The Varying Paths to Justice: Mapping problem resolution routes for users and non-users of the civil, administrative and family justice systems). 
It is hoped our findings will reach a wider international and practitioner audience through our recent and forthcoming publications. First, our book chapter this year (Hunter et al (2017) Access to What? LASPO and Mediation in: A Flynn and J Hodgson, eds., Access to Justice and Legal Aid Comparative Perspectives on Unmet Legal Need) will enable our findings to be compared with developments in other jurisdictions this field. Second, our forthcoming Creating Paths Briefing Paper is aimed at practitioners and policy makers. Finally, our book of the Mapping findings (Barlow A., Hunter R., Smithson J. and Ewing J. (2017) Mapping Paths to Family Justice: Resolving Family Justice in Neoliberal Times) is to be published in the Palgrave Socio-Legal Studies series in April 2017. 

As noted previously, in 2014-2015 and again in 2015 and 2016, our findings had already achieved some significant impact. It was reported in an article in the March 2016 issue of the Family Law Journal (see further Brian Cantwell, 'Exploring a multidisciplinary approach to the practice of private law' (2016) 46(2)) that a family law practice in the North East of England is now offering a joined up service based on the findings of the Mapping Paths to Family Justice study. 
Throughout 2015, the Mapping Paths to Family Justice findings had already begun to inform and influence the development of the proto-type of Relate's online family mediation tool 'Relate Rechtwijzer'. They were also relied upon in Relate's critique of the problems facing separating couples and their analysis of the support needed by people in their policy and research report 'Breaking up is hard to do' Relate: London, November 2015. The report is available at https://www.relate.org.uk/files/relate/publication-breaking-up-is-hard-to-do-report-dec2015_0.pdf 

The findings were also used by the Ministry of Justice in revising their family mediation materials for separating families published in February 2016. 

In terms of future plans, this collaborative work with our collaborators through our Co-creation Impact Accelerator Account Award, Creating Paths to Family Justice Phase 2 during 2016 will be consolidated in our Briefing Paper to be published in Spring 2017 and it is anticipated that annual meetings will be held with this group of experts going forward. 
In 2014, our findings had already had some impact with Policy Makers and with Practitioners and we have had the support of our Project Advisory Group who represent the range of Family Dispute Resolution practitioners as well as researchers at the Ministry of Justice.
Aspects of our findings have been used by the Government Task Force on Family Mediation which published its report in June 2014, in which some of our findings (reported in June 2014) were footnoted.
In addition the Cabinet Office's Innovation Unit contacted us in October 2014 in order to discuss our methods and findings on the party and practitioner experience in order to inform their own research into why people do or do not take up family mediation and what makes it likely to be successful or not.
The Ministry of Justice asked the PI, Anne Barlow to attend an OECD conference on Alternative Dispute Resolution in Paris on 10/11/14 in order to present the research findings on out of court family dispute resolution.
Family Dispute Resolution Practitioner Professional Associations (Family Mediators Association; Resolution) have invited us to present findings on DR best practice and matching processes to parties and cases at two annual conferences and have discussed how to spread best practice and be more alert to screening power imbalance and lack of emotional readiness with us. 
Relevant practitioner journals have asked to publish summaries of different aspects of our findings. Practitioners writing in such journals (e.g. Bull, The Review, September 2014; Stevenson, Family Law Journal, November 2014) have separately engaged with our findings, suggesting how the research should be taken notice of and used to improve best practice. 
A family practice in the North East of England is currently using our findings and recommendations to pilot a model of 'joined up' service and direction of clients to the most appropriate form of dispute resolution and/other sources of support.
The relationship agency One Plus One has agreed to work with us to develop an online tool to assist parties and practitioners to assess emotional readiness before attempting mediation with the aim of improving mediation success rates.
A challenge which has been overcome is to bring a number of different agencies with similar but competing agendas together to consider the feasibility of pooling resources and expertise to use the research findings to improve family dispute resolution. Further impact work is planned with the Ministry of Justice, Department for Work and Pensions, One Plus One, Relate, Family Mediation Council, Resolution, CAFCASS to assess feasibility of further online pre-mediation screening in line with our research findings.
A further current challenge is the lack of funding available to agencies such as Relate and OnePlusOne to enable them to take their planned activities informed by our findings forward in the way we all agree is most appropriate. Whilst Relate's OFDR (RR) is on hold because of financial constraints, they are in talks with potential funders about a learning event following the piloting of RR and have asked the Creating academics to be involved in this which has been agreed in principle.</gtr:description><gtr:id>44C71CDF-F0FC-449D-A8A9-7E1D5FBEE3B0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54326871610ef0.57346611</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Mapping Paths to Family Justice study first aimed to provide an up-to-date picture of awareness and experiences of three principal forms of alternative or out-of-court family dispute resolution (AFDRs): solicitor negotiations; mediation; collaborative law. On awareness, we found that there is recognition of these alternatives to court in the general population, though 45% of our National Omnibus sample had heard of none of them. Less than half (44%) had heard of mediation; this rose to over two thirds among the divorced/separated population. Solicitor negotiations was poorly-recognised as a means of avoiding court even by the divorced/separated, with less than half (48%) aware of it. Media/internet are key sources of information to the general public about AFDRs but for those divorcing/separating since 1996, solicitors were the major source for all AFDRs, including mediation.
Nationally, two thirds of those who had experienced the lawyer-led AFDRs were satisfied with process and outcome, compared with under half (41%) of those who had mediated their dispute. However, in our follow-up interviews with parties, almost three quarters were satisfied with their experience of the mediation process, although far fewer with the outcome. Those who were not satisfied had often felt pressured into mediation. Perceived quality of the practitioner was key to satisfaction in all AFDRs. Overall in our follow-up sample, Mediation was seen as improving communication in around 40% of cases, whereas under a quarter of Solicitor Negotiation participants felt they benefited in this way. Generally people felt well supported by having their own solicitor or collaborative lawyer, allowing them to 'know where they stood' on finances or in relation to children. In Mediation, good communication outcomes were highly correlated with successful resolution. Collaborative Law was very well liked (combining support with a non-partisan approach) but like solicitor negotiations, was criticised for cost.
Concerning norms brought into the processes by parties, we found this was highly gendered and differed in relation to children and finances. In children matters, parties did not feel they were steered in a particular direction, in contrast to financial disputes.
Considering which AFDRs are most 'appropriate' for which cases and parties, we concluded that one size does not fit all. We recommend introducing a neutral triage system (conducted by practitioners knowledgeable about all AFDRS) open to directing people to the appropriate process. Some cases are unsuited to mediation (e.g. where violence/control or mental health issues exist or one party is not 'emotionally ready'). Suitability for AFDRs depends largely on the disposition of the parties, not the nature of the case. For collaborative law or mediation, there needs to be willingness to engage and communicate; relatively low conflict; an equal power dynamic and openness to compromise. The lawyer-led AFDRs are more appropriate where there are highly complex financial issues, power disparity. Only solicitor negotiations are appropriate where there are entrenched positions, control/mental health issues or a vengeance agenda. Mediation can help in high conflict children cases to improve communication and does well for financial disputes where there is a highly skilled mediator. 
Whilst we found many mediators were trained for child inclusive mediation, we identified few parties who had experienced it. We identified a lack of confidence by some practitioners and some parents around this process and we consider the voice of the child in AFDRs needs further attention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Having followed our Pathways to Impact plan to include representatives of the range AFDR processes, we actively engaged and consulted with the practitioner community throughout the project. The Law Society, National Family Mediation, Family Mediators Association and Resolution all contributed to aspects of the project and received our findings well.
Our final conference was attended by an audience of 70 practitioners, policy makers and academics interested in out-of-court family dispute resolution, including David Norgrove who chaired the Government Task Force on Family Mediation (of which the PI was also an invited member), and some of our initial findings were included in the Task Force Report in June 2014.
Having been asked to give keynote addresses and other presentations by national mediation associations and collaborative law practitioners, we anticipate that our findings will shape and influence training of mediators and collaborative lawyers, in particular, and the professional associations have confirmed this is the case. 
We are currently concluding a collaborative joint venture with One Plus One who provide educational online relationship support tools to help parties assess emotional readiness for mediation to help prevent inappropriate cases and prepare parties for mediation.
We are also currently taking the research findings to a further stage of impact work, following the award of Impact Accelerator funding in April 2015. We are working with One Plus One, Relate, the Ministry of Justice, CAFCASS, Resolution and the Family Mediation Council to consider how feasible it would be to build out from the Emotional Readiness online tool, developed with One Plus One to use other aspects of the research findings to inform the development of a further online 'screening tool' (currently being developed by Relate) to assist parties and practitioners to more effectively 'explore and diagnose' appropriate and inappropriate cases for family mediation. This would aim to offer or direct parties to more specialist help before attempting mediation where necessary, particularly in high conflict disputes. We are also actively assisting Relate in developing their online mediation service (Relate Rechtwijzer) in our second phase Co-Creation ESRC IAA Award Creating Paths to Family Justice, due to complete by the end of November 2016. Our work with our other collaborators on this project - Ministry of Justice, Resolution, Cafcass, Family Mediation Council - aims to address the confusing array of online information for people separating about how to resolve family disputes.
In terms of taking scholarship forward, we have secured a book contract with Palgrave Macmillan. The proposal for the book, 'Mapping Paths to Family Justice: Resolving Family Disputes in Neoliberal Times' was positively reviewed and will be published in 2016.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2A3188C6-63E9-41DC-832E-574F1C412357</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54326750e84233.22083474</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/law/research/frs/researchprojects/mappingpathstofamilyjustice/keyfindings/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Government Task Force on Family Mediation by PI Anne Barlow</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7035F5A6-31C0-4053-A32D-B97982951C16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Task Force advocated that as failure of a partner to attend the pre-mediation MIAM was a key reason for family mediation to fail and subsequently the Minister for Justice Rt Hon Simon Hughes MP announced legal aid funding for both parties (rather than just the legally aidable party) to attend the MIAM free of charge.

Your insightful review of and extensive feedback on the prototype service and the rich discussions you facilitated in the Creating Paths workshops significantly shaped the re-design of the OFDR service. Your focus throughout on bringing in the user insight from the Mapping Paths to Family Justice research was highly effective. It allowed us to put in context and extend the user insight we were gathering in parallel from the user testing of the prototype service. I believe this approach has also embedded a stronger user-centred and evidence-based focus for the expert practitioners and service leaders present in the workshops. We have provided more detail in the attached impact form. I hope you can see from this the extensive impact your Creating Paths to Family Justice project has had to shaping Online Family Dispute Resolution (OFDR) service. It has led to comprehensive and practical improvements of the tool's design itself, of quality assurance procedures in the service management specification, of the practitioner selection and training requirements, of the communication and marketing approaches, and our efforts to find a sustainable social business model that can support affordable access to justice. We regret we were not able to complete the full programme originally planned. Unfortunately, we have experienced ongoing delays with the public launch of the ODFR service. The delays are primarily due to: 1) Managing the risks of Relate's planned substantive investment in the public launch of the service at a time of consultation about a major structural change in the Relate Federation; 2) Protracted contract negotiations with our technology suppliers; and 3) Securing partnerships that bring co-investment and additional know-how - in particular legal and commercial expertise - in order to sustainably offer an affordable service and to manage the larger than anticipated costs of developing a well-designed tool appropriate for the England &amp;amp; Wales jurisdiction. On behalf of Relate, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and all your colleagues on the Creating Paths to Justice project team. We would be very happy to respond to any questions your funder has about the impact of the project and contribute to case studies or similar.

I would like to take this opportunity to capture Relate's feedback on the Mapping Paths to Family Justice research that you and your research team led. I write in the context of a major innovation project that Relate has been carrying out: the development of an Online Family Dispute Resolution (OFDR) service. Our ambition is for this development to help fill the gap in affordable access to justice and relationship support for separating families in the current climate of austerity and legal aid cuts.

Your research has been very useful and informative throughout the entire development process. I would like here, however, to comment in particular on how it has informed the early stages of our development:

Firstly, it helped us to shape our concept proposal that resulted from our initial Discovery Process (March to October 2014). The research helped us to determine the problem statement and key design requirements for our development. Here your rich insights into the experience of people going through separation were particularly helpful to identify gaps in support and unmet needs in the current landscape. This and the quantitative research also helped to inform our initial business case that secured the internal go-ahead for the development.

Secondly, the research helped to drive key workstreams in our Prototyping and Proof of Concept stage (November 2014 - October 2015). This phase was funded through the Google Impact Challenge UK 2014. This rich qualitative research of the Mapping Study helped to inform the OFDR service blue-print and develop user personas. Both are critical for the successful design of a digital service. 

The research also helped us to establish and test the viability of developing a sustainable operating model for the service. In this way the Mapping Study contributed significantly to the successful proof of concept for the OFDR service.


On behalf of Relate, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and all your colleagues on the Mapping Team. 

Yours,


Laura Dowson
