Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a long-term, incurable condition, affecting 1% of the adult population. It causes joint pain and stiffness, which overtime can result in damage. In RA the body's immune system (which is designed to defend against infection) becomes too active and mistakenly attacks the body's own tissue. Drug therapies that treat RA do so by targeting the immune system. These are called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 

The problem
Patients with RA experience frequent and severe infections, with twice as many hospital admissions compared to people without the disease. Serious infections are the tip of the iceberg, with over 30% of patients reporting non-serious infections each year. When a patient has an infection, their clinician will stop their DMARDs. Without treatment for RA, disease activity worsens and the disease may 'flare'. Interrupted treatment regimens are associated worsening disease and increased joint damage. 

The research question
Current belief is that the increased risk of infection in patients with RA is a side effect of drug therapy. However, we propose that the active inflammatory process in RA is an important cause of susceptibility to infection. We believe that this is because chronic inflammation paradoxically suppresses the immune system, putting patients at greater risk of infection. This is supported by clinical experience where patients with more severe disease experience more infections. It is currently not known how much the disease state contributes to the body's ability to resist infection. We want to answer this question.

Study aim
Our research will address how much the disease state contributes to infection susceptibility. Our goal is to study the clinical and laboratory features of a large group of RA patients to identify which of these characteristics put them at greatest risk of infection, independent of drug therapy. 

Study plan
The TACERA (Towards A Cure in RA) dataset has acquired extensive clinical information and blood samples on 270 patients with newly diagnosed RA prior to starting treatment. It is one of the richest datasets generated in recent years combining large amounts of clinical and laboratory data. Importantly, this is &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot; data because patients were treated as they would be in routine clinical practice. All infectious events have been captured throughout the study, and so the high risk group has already been identified. In this study we will compare the patients who have had an infection with those who did not. Initial work will identify any differences in their clinical characteristics (e.g. age, smoking, disease severity). The TACERA dataset has detailed analysis of the patients' blood samples prior to starting DMARDs, with the measurements of the expression of thousands of genes that control the way the immune system functions. We can look at this data and see if there are any specific differences between patients that developed infections compared to those who did not. This will help identify patterns associated with the risk of infection. 

We will then investigate changes in the blood after starting DMARDs, to identify changes in the immune system associated with an increased risk of infection. We will compare these patterns to those seen before therapy was started. This will enable us to assess the relative contribution of the drug and the disease on the risk of infection.

Study impact
We anticipate being in a position to use a combination of blood test results with clinical features to determine for every patient their risk of developing an infection. This test may contribute to a scoring system that considers other risks factors for infection, and may be relevant to patients with many inflammatory disorders. In clinical practice this means we could identify high risk patients and personalise their care, preventing infection, improving safety of treatment, and optimising long-term outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience frequent and severe infections. The current dogma is that infection is a result of the pharmacological agents used to treat the disease. Evidence for this is not robust. It is recognised that the inflammatory state in RA is immunosuppressive. This is supported by patients with active disease having more infections. We hypothesise that the active disease state in RA is the dominant risk factor for infection.

Aim: To investigate the extent to which disease-related immunological signatures are predictors of infection. 

Objectives
1.To characterise infection in early RA 
2.To determine the cellular and molecular signatures that are predictors of infection 
3.Develop a therapy decision tool that stratifies for infection risk

Methods: A dataset derived from an established early RA cohort will be used (TACERA). This contains extensive clinical, cellular and molecular data on 270 patients with RA and a comprehensive prospective capture of all infectious events from diagnosis to 18 month follow-up. A Delphi exercise will be conducted to support grading of infectious events. A case control approach will be used to identify clinical, cellular and molecular signatures associated with infection. Validation analysis will include an 'extreme infection' phenotype as well as a survival modelling of 'time to event' approach. Cellular and molecular signals associated with infection will be analysed at 6 months after the initiation of DMARDs to assess the impact of drug therapy on infection. The large SERA cohort (n=1200) will be used to validate the results of this study. 

Scientific opportunities: A clinically valuable risk prediction tool will be developed using a biomarker sets based on the cellular and molecular signatures that best predict infection. This will contribute to a web based 'infection risk score' to identify 'high-risk' patients and inform decisions regarding RA drug therapy and infection.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The anticipated output of this research will: 

1) Deliver and then publish a severity grading system for infectious events in clinical studies, 
2) Identify and validate clinical, cellular and molecular predictors of infection in early rheumatoid arthritis and 
3) Develop a therapy decision tool that is used in clinical practice to stratify for infection risk. 
 
These will be accomplished by the end of the fellowship and have direct impact on a wide range of beneficiaries. We predict that the research outputs from the 'oRAcle' study will also benefit other parties across a range of institutions in both the short and longer term. At this point, we believe that the main beneficiaries, both in the UK and globally, are likely to include:
 
1. Patients with newly diagnosed early rheumatoid arthritis 
2. Patients with other autoimmune conditions who are treated with immunosuppression e.g. lupus, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease
3. Clinicians from across a range of disciplines, such as rheumatologists, dermatologists and gastroenterologists, who treat patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases.
4. NHS England , through the financial impact of identifying high risk subjects (e.g. admission costs)
5. UK business economy (reduction in yearly cost of sickness absence)
6. Private sector (i.e. pharmaceutical organisations)
7. Health policy markers within international, national, local or devolved government
8. Rheumatoid Arthritis charities (NRAS)
 
We predict by the end of this fellowship that we will be able to identify and risk stratify susceptibility to infection. The impact of the project will therefore be to reduce the burden of infectious disease in RA, improving patient experience. This will enhance patients understanding of their own disease and allow the provision of personalised care. My initial patient focus group work has demonstrated how debilitating infection is for patients with RA, physically, mentally and financially. The reduction of infectious events and improvement in the treatment of RA will have major impact on patient quality of life. The implication of these findings may not only been beneficial to patients with RA but also to patients with other immune mediated inflammatory conditions, who are also treated with immunomodulating therapies.
 
Clinicians managing patients with RA will benefit from this project because this study will develop an infection risk score and infection risk guidelines for use in the clinical setting. This will provide support to the supervising rheumatologist when commencing drug therapy, or managing infection in patients with RA. Our works seeks to challenge the current belief that medication is the key driver of infection in RA and provide a robust evidence base for clinical decision making. Improving national guidelines in this area will impact on health policy makers, who may incorporate infection risk stratification into their policies for financial gain. 
 
Reducing infections in RA will have immediate financial benefit. The cost of an infective admission in RA ranges from &amp;pound;2888 to over &amp;pound;6000, placing a major burden on the NHS. Work disability may also ensue from infectious events and is particularly relevant in RA, given that the burden of disease is within the working age population. Preventing infections and improving subsequent disease control should reduce absence from work and improve individual and societal economic prosperity. 
 
From a commercial standpoint there is the potential for the biomarker tool to be commercially developed and patented for use in the NHS or the wider health care arena. If we identify that the disease state is the dominant contributor to the risk of infection, this may benefit pharmaceutical companies when developing future drug therapies. There is the potential to utilise our infection risk stratification for use in drug development trials and in the disseminating their results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238423</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R001332/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
