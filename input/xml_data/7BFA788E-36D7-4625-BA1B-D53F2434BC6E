Rivers, mobility and monumentality in the land between Avebury and Stonehenge: The Vale of Pewsey project</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M008304/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Late Neolithic period represents a key stage in our human history sitting as it does on the threshold between the Stone Age and Bronze Age. At this time a suite of cultural and ideological changes swept through Britain, including the introduction of the first metalwork. These cultural developments also involved the rapid construction of enormous ceremonial monuments, indicating a period of intense religiosity. Nowhere in the British Isles is this more evident today than within the Wessex landscape, with the construction of the major monuments at Avebury, Stonehenge and Silbury Hill.
This project will take a new perspective on understanding the prehistoric landscape of the Wessex region, pioneering a holistic approach that uses connectivity and mobility as central themes, challenging archaeology's traditional focus upon place (Leary 2014; Kador &amp;amp; Leary in prep). The project will consider Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age monuments as nodes in a ceremonial and pilgrimage nexus. It will focus on the sacred importance of water and the use of rivers as route-ways linking ritual and ceremonial architecture. It appraises these monuments as interrelated through their connections to the river, representing a linked chain of cult centres that people journeyed to, and therefore takes the river valley and associated monuments as a single entity for study. This contrasts with the dominant views of the area that focus on just Stonehenge (for example Darvill and Wainwright 2009) or the interaction and duality between Stonehenge and Durrington Walls (such as Parker Pearson and Ramilisonina 1998 or Parker Pearson 2012), and moves interpretation on from discussions of centralised social polities and fixed notions of power.
The project, led by the University of Reading in collaboration with the Wiltshire Museum and English Heritage, will examine the internationally important prehistoric landscape between Avebury and Stonehenge, linking for the first time the spatially separate components of the same World Heritage Site. The work will focus on the upper reaches of the River Avon in the Vale of Pewsey where recent aerial photographic work has mapped a plethora of prehistoric monuments and ceremonial sites. These include Marden henge - a large Neolithic complex with extraordinary internal features, including a now demolished huge mound, an internal henge, and a unique recently discovered Neolithic ritual building with associated evidence of feasting.
The project will take place over three fieldwork seasons (2015 to 2017), followed by a full programme of analysis, archiving and publication (2018 to 2019). It will comprise investigations on various nested scales. These will include detailed, targeted, open area excavations aimed at understanding activities undertaken within and between the monuments, and a programme of test pitting to discern linkages between them and the River Avon. A programme of coring, test pitting and fieldwalking along the river and in the wider landscape will investigate the environmental history of the Vale, testing hypotheses of natural and human environmental disturbance in areas where monument complexes developed.
The project will form part of the University of Reading's field school, a credit-bearing undergraduate module; the running and infrastructure for which will be funded separately by the University. Summary assessment reports will be produced at the end of each season and the Integrated Archaeological Database will be made available via the project website. The major academic output for the project will be a substantial monograph. A synthesis of the work will be published in the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society. Other outputs will include regular updates on the project website, including fieldwork summaries, blogs, site diaries, and finds reports. There will also be an annual exhibition in the Wiltshire Museum, and a public symposium on the archaeology of the Vale of Pewsey.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's inclusive ethos, combined with opportunities for public participation in a wide range of activities embracing varying interests and capabilities, will promote social cohesion, health and wellbeing within communities living in the Vale of Pewsey. This project will provide public outreach opportunities, engaging, amongst others, farming communities and military families, to build awareness and enthusiasm for their historic environment and to preserve the hidden history of their local area. The project therefore ties in with the AHRC 'Connected Communities' theme. The area is also a popular tourist destination with numerous holiday-makers, day-trippers, walkers and cyclists, providing further outreach opportunities. Current interpretations focus very much on the monuments themselves but this project will enable these diverse audiences to engage with the landscape context of Stonehenge and Avebury in new and innovative ways.

The project will benefit government and local authorities by providing a direct feed of data into Historic Environment Records and Conservation Management Plans to enhance the protection, management and promotion of the Vale of Pewsey's archaeological heritage. National bodies and advisory groups will be able to draw upon the project as a model for how to pursue major research targets within a collaborative framework; an approach of direct relevance to current policy, encouraging greater cohesion between regional, local, voluntary bodies and the private citizen in the exploitation of heritage assets.
Project Partner, the Wiltshire Museum, will develop a temporary exhibition on the site, as well as run a shuttle bus between the museum and site for the duration of the fieldwork. It will also host a public symposium on the archaeology of the Vale of Pewsey at the end of the field work. The project will help the museum meet its strategic aim of public education in archaeology and will benefit from the input of new material and interpretations to enhance its existing displays. The research will also contribute to the interpretation and public presentation of other prehistoric monuments, including the Avebury &amp;amp; Stonehenge WHS.
The project will undertake fieldwalking with the Wiltshire Archaeology Field Group, and engage with other societies, such as the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, and the newly-formed Stonehenge and Avebury Archaeological and Historical Research Group. These groups will benefit from opportunities to collaborate in academic and agenda-setting research that examines a seminal period and area, and to adopt, through knowledge transfer, scientific methodologies used on the project to enhance their own in-house expertise, which can be deployed on future projects.
Prehistory is taught within the National Curriculum at Key Stage 2, and this project will work with the existing links of Project Partners (the Wiltshire Museum and English Heritage) and of Widening Participation Schemes of the University of Reading, to actively and directly engage with local schools and their students. We will also work with the Young Archaeologists Club, which introduces children to fieldwork and scientific investigation. We will offer archaeological experience and generic skills in preparation for Higher Education or the work place through placements on the site to A-level students. Schools will benefit from a variety of experiential learning environments tailored to the enhancement of teaching across disciplines. The location of the site near to Stonehenge will provide an added attraction for schools, both local and more widely across the south of England. We will build on the significant expertise built up at Silchester, which was attended by over 100 A-Level and work experience placements per year.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in oral history project</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>179FB78F-1961-491B-9B90-064E27C37E0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jim Leary was interviewed and recorded for an oral history project organised by the Wiltshire Museum, Devizes.
