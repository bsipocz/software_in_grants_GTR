In humans, parental life-histories (e.g., diet) and not genetics are significant predictors for the development of various heritable health risks (e.g., diabetes, obesity). Moreover, these disease risks have increased in frequency an order of magnitude within a few decades. These processes are thought to reflect a small snapshot of the larger adaptive evolutionary process. Indeed, parental effects may have consequences on an evolutionary time-scale, buffering or facilitating a population's response to rapid environmental change. Yet classical genetic models of evolution inadequately explain how rapidly traits adapt and change in response to changing environments. One theoretical explanation is that family environments can accelerate these processes. However, the biological mechanisms through which parents may drive adaptive evolutionary change has yet to be elucidated. My project will explore the idea that epigenetic mechanisms might be mediating this process. Epigenetic mechanisms are the biochemical marks and signals that ultimately determine how accessible DNA is to factors within the cell that allow it to be expressed. I have previously shown that these epigenetic factors are induced by changes in the parental and social family environment and can be inherited by offspring from their parents. I propose to examine whether epigenetic mechanisms can also drive adaptive evolutionary change using the burying beetle (Nicrophorus vespilloides) as a model system. This species has a rich and complex social family life but a short lifespan, making rigorous evolutionary epigenetic studies over the course of many generations (e.g., 25+) in this system tractable and feasible.

My collaborators have exploited natural variation in care in the burying beetle to establish two types of experimentally evolving populations in the laboratory, which vary only in the family environment that larvae experience during development, and in which the same family environment is created for successive generations within populations. In Full Care populations (FC), parents remain with their young throughout development. In contrast, in No Care populations (NC), parents are removed just before their offspring hatch. This manipulation has revealed that burying beetles are highly responsive to the family environment, and removal of care induces rapid evolutionary change in morphology and behaviour. For example, larvae evolving under NC become more competitive for resources and develop larger mandibles relative to their body size; these traits are correlated with increased larval survival over generations. I plan to investigate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in driving these adaptive evolutionary changes by combining analyses of epigenetic and genetic variation with detailed analyses of parental effects in the egg. This study will be the first to experimentally determine whether epigenetic mechanisms enable the family environment to influence adaptive evolutionary change. Understanding the interaction between genetic and epigenetic change under changing environments and the degree of flexibility afforded by these systems has broad implications for the study of how traits become heritable between generations with applications for the fields of behavioural ecology, conservation, medicine and epidemiology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Predicting the rate at which populations can evolve and adapt in a rapidly changing world is a major challenge for contemporary evolutionary biology. Classical genetic models of evolution inadequately explain how rapidly traits adapt and change in response to changing environments across generations. One theoretical explanation is that social and family environments modulate the inheritance of traits and thus the response to natural selection. Epigenetic mechanisms (i.e. the biochemical marks and signals that change the expression levels of genes), are one avenue through which these effects can be achieved. Though a role for epigenetic mechanisms in mediating adaptive evolutionary change has been hypothesized, there is little empirical data to support the dynamics of these changes on an evolutionary timescale. Parents facilitate the transmission of environmental cues as well as their DNA to their offspring. The evidence that many of these effects act via the regulation of gene expression suggests that the family environment could play a significant role in facilitating adaptive evolutionary change via epigenetic mechanisms. I plan to investigate the role of epigenetic inheritance in driving adaptive evolutionary change in the burying beetle (Nicrophorus vespilloides). I will use long-term, controlled populations that have been evolving in the absence of parental. These populations show a cascade of adaptive evolutionary changes. Using this model, my objectives will be as follows: 1) to determine the transcriptional consequences of removing parental care across ecological (1 generation) and evolutionary (15+ generations) timescales; 2) to assess both epigenetic and genetic changes to establish the mechanism through which changes in gene expression can arise in these evolving populations; 3) to characterize parental inputs (via the egg) to determine how parents could contribute epigenetic signals to mediate behavioural changes in their developing offspring.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is growing public interest in the link between the environment, health and lifespan, and how parental lifestyle factors can have long-term impacts on the health of offspring. My research will highlight how these topics are relevant not just to humans, but how an awareness of the environment and its impacts on subsequent generations can apply to organisms as diverse as humans and insects. Understanding how our genomes are shaped by the environment is critical for understanding how our decisions and activities impact our health as well as the health of our offspring and grand offspring. Moreover, understanding how evolution works enriches appreciation of the natural world, and our place in it, and is key to understanding major societal issues (e.g. antibiotic resistance and the threat posed to the natural world by climate change).
 
To broaden the impact of my research on public appreciation of science and to ensure that my results reach a wide audience, I will:
1) Attend free training courses provided by University of Cambridge and BBSRC on 'Introduction to public engagement and science communication' and 'Translating your research into a hands-on activity'.
2) Develop a strong online presence for my project using Twitter and my personal website, work with the University's press team when papers arising from my research are published. I will also write popular science articles for online resources such as The Conversation.
3) Contribute to public outreach events such as scientists in schools, publicly available seminars, the Cambridge Science Festival and SoapBox Science events.
4) Work with a professional web developer, Samuel Galson, to implement a web-based, user-friendly version of my results to help effectively communicate topics in genetics, epigenetics and patterns of evolution in our changing world (e.g., extreme climate, human intervention, disease risk). These materials can be used for in-class demonstrations and will be made publicly available through my Twitter/website for public use.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>303353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R01115X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F9C365-02D0-4623-9A73-8CA09DA0FFF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Evolution &amp; populations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>20FF6FDE-28DB-4D9D-99E6-8470C745EA60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transcriptomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
