Its cost to the UK economy is particularly bothersome in light of projected future economic instability. Public Health England recently reported that the cost of overweight and obesity to the UK economy is &amp;pound;15.8 billion, annually. Almost one third of this economic burden is carried directly by the NHS. Recent years have seen an alarming rise in the incidence of obesity during pregnancy. This is particularly concerning as maternal obesity during pregnancy increases the risk of obesity in offspring. The mechanisms through which maternal obesity may promote obesity in offspring, however, remain to be fully clarified. Obesity is characterized by the excessive expansion of fat (adipose) tissue. Adipose tissue may expand through production of new fat cells (adipogenesis) or enlargement of existing fat cells by hypertrophy. Adipogenesis occurs in two distinct phases: during development, where it is referred to as developmental adipogenesis, and in adulthood, where it is referred to as obesogenic adipogenesis. Obesogenic adipogenesis occurs in response to a chronic high-fat diet stimulus. Remarkably, our preliminary findings in mice suggest that obesogenic adipogenesis is in enhanced in offspring of obese mothers, while developmental adipogenesis is unaffected. This suggests that enhanced adulthood adipogenesis, which represents a potential 'risk factor' for obesity, may have its origins in utero. Our preliminary studies have also revealed that treatment of obese mothers with the anti-diabetes drug metformin (which is routinely prescribed in pregnancy to treat gestational diabetes), during pregnancy and lactation, attenuates the enhanced obesogenic adipogenic response in offspring of obese mothers. The mechanisms underlying the enhanced obesogenic adipogenesis in offspring of obese mothers and the role of maternal metformin treatment in modifying it remain largely unknown, however. The main purpose of this proposalis to uncover the mechanistic basis behind this developmental programming of obesogenic adipogenesis in offspring from obese mothers as well as establishing the role played by metformin in modifying this response, by using an array of molecular biology and physiological approaches. This study will allow us to unravel a potential mechanism through which maternal obesity may predispose offspring to obesity themselves and explore potential therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recent studies have shown that adipogenesis may be enhanced in offspring of obese mothers yet these studies only reported in vitro findings. Thus, key questions remained unanswered, such as whether maternal obesity resulted in offspring adipose tissue hyperplasia in-vivo and whether it affected developmental or obesogenic adipogenesis. This is particularly important as these two adipogenic processes have recently been shown to require distinct subpopulations of adipocyte progenitors and utilize different signalling pathways. Our unpublished preliminary findings have revealed that maternal obesity increases obesogenic adipogenesis in offspring but plays no role in developmental adipogenesis. Furthermore, this increased hyperplastic response in offspring adipose tissue following maternal obesity is attenuated by maternal metformin treatment during pregnancy and lactation. We discovered that mRNA expression of the adipocyte progenitor marker CD34 is upregulated in the adipose tissue of offspring from obese mothers, suggesting an increased presence of adipocyte progenitors in offspring adipose tissue in response to maternal obesity. The purpose of this proposal is to uncover the precise molecular mechanisms behind the developmental programming of obesogenic adipogenesis and establish how metformin impacts upon it. We hypothesize that the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is a key mediator in this process given that we have recently shown it to regulate adipocyte progenitor proliferation (Merkestein et al. Nature Communications, 2015). Furthermore, in our prelimary studies, FTO mRNA expression was elevated in fibroblastic cells isolated from embryos of obese mothers. We will test this hypothesis using a range of molecular biology techniques and mouse models of maternal obesity. This proposal not only serves to establish the precise molecular mechanisms underlying a new phenomenon but also aims to generate clinically relevant outputs for obesity treatment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has the potential to benefit non-academics. This will be in the form of:
A) Pharmaceutical industry
B) Clinicians
C) Wider public

The pharmaceutical industry are potential beneficiaries. For example, we have spoken with collaborators from MedImmune who are currently screening for activators of adipose tissue metabolism using in vitro methods and have expressed an interest in potentially using the mouse models we propose to generate here, to investigate the effects of their compounds on adipogenesis in vivo. See Pathways to Impact section for further details. Beyond our collaborators, the pharmaceutical industry in general, and particularly those interested in diabetes drug therapy may benefit from the knowledge of how the anti-diabetes drug metformin acts to inhibit adipogenesis. 

Clinicians are also potential beneficiaries of our research which has implications for obesity treatment and prevention. To this end we intend to foster links with clinical colleagues at the Southampton General Hospital to assess developmental adipogenesis in a human context. We have recently established an exciting collaborative link with Prof Dennis McGonagle at the University of Leeds who has agreed to supply us with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to study the effect of obesity-associated FTO risk alleles on adipogenesis in human cells. The findings of the current proposal have the potential to justify investigating developmental adipogenesis in human cells and as such our data would be of huge benefit to clinicians interested in the developmental programming of adipogenesis. Furthermore, clinicians in general, particularly those who prescribe the drug metformin, which is commonly used to treat gestational diabetes, will benefit from the results of our study which assesses the mechanistic basis behind a novel role for this drug in adipogenesis. 

Our research will also potentially benefit the wider public. This could have a major impact on public health. For instance, disseminating the knowledge that maternal obesity may have a lasting effect on the health of future generations could, not only serve to educate the wider public in scientific developments relevant to health and wellbeing but also lead to lifestyle changes in individuals. This could slow or even reverse the disturbing trends in maternal obesity. An example of an initiative with which we intend to engage in disseminating our research to the wider public is LifeLab (details of which are given in Pathways to Impact). Obesity prevention rather than treatment is the most reliable and cost-effective way to tackle the problem. Thus the nutritional implications of our research (i.e. that maternal nutrition during the pregnancy and early postnatal periods could have long lasting negative health consequences in offspring) indicate that easily incorporated lifestyle changes in expectant mothers may be the most effective way to combat the obesity pandemic. Therefore, initiatives such as LifeLab wherein local school children are made aware of important scientific discoveries and their relevance to their own health, are perhaps more useful (and certainly cost effective) than any pharmaceutical or clinical endeavor to treat or prevent obesity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>416666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P011683/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
