Reductions</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L018616/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>PACIFIC is a multi-discipline programme, across 12 UK universities, that supports a future nuclear fuel cycle in the UK. We aim to provide a world-class programme of relevant research into the manufacture, performance, and recycle of current and advanced nuclear fuels. For the first time in a major UK academic research programme, we will integrate the two Themes of Nuclear Fuel and Separations Technology into a single programme with a common goal. 
In the Fuels Theme, our aim is to provide a scientific and technological underpinning to understanding the damage mechanisms that occur in nuclear fuel and cladding materials throughout their operational life and during storage. Our objectives are to:
1. extend molecular dynamics models to predict key properties of advanced fuels;
2. identify promising single component and composite materials for advanced fuels and to develop appropriate manufacturing routes.;
3. investigate the potential for improved TRISO coated fuel particles by employing a duel SiC/ZrC layer;
4. assess the performance of advanced fuels and coatings under a range of conditions; and
5. investigate the mechanism of Pellet-Cladding Interaction failures in LWRs.
The first Fuels project addresses advanced fuels and coatings. This Project will employ a combination of advanced modelling and experimental techniques to identify promising new fuel materials, and to explore the mechanisms and effects of radiation damage in both current and advanced fuel materials, including coated fuel particles. Specific Tasks include:
- Fuel Modelling
- Advanced Fuel Manufacture
- Advanced TRISO Coated Fuel Particles
- Materials Characterisation and Irradiation
The second Fuels project concerns a failure mechanism known as Pellet-Cladding Interaction (PCI). This project will focus on developing a mechanistic understanding of PCI by bringing together metallurgical, mechanical engineering, chemical and radiation aspects; by a combination of experimental investigations and underpinned by computer simulation.
In the Separations theme, the projects aim to provide a proof of concept for an integrated flowsheet capable of providing a product suitable for fast reactor fuels from a thermal fuel feed. Our objectives are to:
1. Prove that U, Pu and MAs can be separated to the required purities and in a mixed product for conversion to fast reactor fuel.
2. Prove that the liquid product from a hydrometallurgical separation process can be converted to the required form for fast reactor fuel manufacture.
3. Prove that a new hydrometallurgical separation process can operate within current solvent extraction technologies.
4. Prove that new technologies are available that will offer benefits over current solvent extraction technologies.
The project on Minor Actinide Separations will investigate new hydrophobic extractants use in separation of MAs from lanthanides, group actinide separations and Am/Cm separations. Specific Tasks include: 
- Direct Monitoring of Speciation in Minor Actinide Separations
- Optimising Interfacial Transfer Kinetics during Minor Actinide Separations
- Actinide Behaviour and Radiolysis Effects of Complexants in Minor Actinide Separations
- Ligand Structure-Activity Relationship Development
The project on Advanced Separations Technology includes the following tasks: 
- Develop a better understanding of conventional solvent extraction technology 
- High efficiency extractions using intensified processes
- Continuous Chromatographic Separation of Actinides and Fission Products
The final project concerns Product Conversion to Fuel, and will develop the fundamental molten salt technology to take the product from a PUREX plant and convert it efficiently through direct reduction to metal, considering proliferation resistance and waste minimisation. Tasks include:
- Establishment and optimisation of the process for direct reduction of spent fuel
- Decontamination and immobilisation of pyroprocessing wastes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PACIFIC programme will create a significant body of knowledge on closing the nuclear fuel cycle in the UK and a set of new researchers whose skills will be critical to the successful implementation of the Government's nuclear strategy in the coming decades. It is vital that the knowledge and skills created are supported, nurtured and maintained after the end of PACIFIC, so during the programme lifetime steps will be taken to facilitate this. Furthermore we aim to disseminate the results of our research amongst a wide audience, including non-specialists and the public. Therefore our pathway to impact will be through two routes: Knowledge Management, and Outreach and Public Engagement.
1. Knowledge management for PACIFIC needs to consider three environments:
- Within the programme
- Within the UK nuclear community
- Within the international nuclear community
The overriding priority of the consortium members must be to publish with an emphasis on submitting outputs in open-access journals. From a perspective of knowledge retention, storage of scientific and engineering information from data collected in this programme is best carried out using public domain systems. Whilst this covers printed and documented knowledge, much of the learning from R&amp;amp;D comes from interaction with fellow researchers. PACIFIC will create a team of Project Leaders who will establish an effective network with their team of Co-I's through regular meetings.
Within the UK nuclear community, we will ensure that the knowledge created is transferred into and adopted by industry. We will also prioritise the creation of 2-way knowledge exchange to ensure PACIFIC is informed by the needs of UK industry for most effective impact. Many of our partners have provided added value contributions (e.g. CASE studentships) whose shared supervision will lead to research closely aligned to and informed by the &amp;quot;industrial pull&amp;quot;. 
Within the international nuclear community, knowledge will be mostly concerned with using the results to further collaborative programmes for benefit to the UK.
2. Our Outreach and Public Engagement strategy is driven by three criteria; who (will need to be informed), why (will they want to listen) and how (will we get them the information they need, in the form that best suits them). 
Who and Why
There are three constituencies that will benefit from learning about PACIFIC and its activities:
- Industry: interested in the technical knowledge and skills created on PACIFIC and in a form which they can use to support their own commercial and technical strategies. 
- Long-term Nuclear Energy Strategy. PACIFIC will inform the activities of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board (NIRAB) and the Nuclear Innovation and Research Office (NIRO) 
- The Public: a well-informed and supportive public is vital to the future implementation of nuclear energy. The public will want to know how research will address their concerns on safety, energy security and waste.
How
- Annual Seminars where we presents our research to an open audience.
- Research Almanacs that summarises the results and provides analysis on the impact against the Long-term Nuclear Energy Strategy and Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap.
- Themed Workshops to disseminate knowledge on specific issues
- Website: providing a repository and showcase for key information and outcomes of our research.
- Press Articles describing the aim, scope and results of PACIFIC.
- Small Scale Initiatives - third party public engagement opportunities, including: media interviews, public lectures, debating forums, Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique, Science Week activities.
- Training &amp;amp; Development - mentoring and developing our researchers to be competent in the skills and expertise that are valued inside and outside of academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3053898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:id>39C21515-E1DC-48A4-A5CC-E115712E1356</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary collaboration involving chemistry and chemical engineering.

(18-19 June 2014, University of Manchester)
The goal of the first workshop was to bring together researchers with an interest in the key area of Pellet Cladding Interaction (PCI), and together with key industrial partners discuss what is known, what needs to be investigated and how future research can be carried out in a coherent way, avoiding fragmentation and producing the most impact. Attendees included representatives of a range universities, research institutes and industry with participants coming from the Australia, France, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K. and U.S.A.
The key outcome of the workshop is an agreement to form a research consortium to coordinate work in the area of PCI (PACE - Pellet-Associated Cladding Degradation). It was agreed that the complex nature of the PCI phenomenon required improved understanding of a number of interdependent material behaviours. Combining the strengths and capabilities of a range of institutions interested in working in this area with the knowledge and experience present in industry will provide a strong platform to achieving this goal. The aim of the proposed consortium will be to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the PCI phenomena.
Key industrial partners (Westinghouse, EDF, Studsvik and Rolls Royce) provided presentations detailing their perspective on PCI and the resulting discussions led to the development of a number of potential research projects to be pursued by the consortium members. 
Since the workshop, the PACE consortium has proceeded to have biannual progress meetings, where current and future projects are discussed. PhD projects associated with PACE are underway at Manchester University and Imperial College London as well as at Queens University in Canada and Boise State University in the US.

(18-19 June 2014, University of Manchester)
The goal of the first workshop was to bring together researchers with an interest in the key area of Pellet Cladding Interaction (PCI), and together with key industrial partners discuss what is known, what needs to be investigated and how future research can be carried out in a coherent way, avoiding fragmentation and producing the most impact. Attendees included representatives of a range universities, research institutes and industry with participants coming from the Australia, France, Sweden, Switzerland, U.K. and U.S.A.
The key outcome of the workshop is an agreement to form a research consortium to coordinate work in the area of PCI (PACE - Pellet-Associated Cladding Degradation). It was agreed that the complex nature of the PCI phenomenon required improved understanding of a number of interdependent material behaviours. Combining the strengths and capabilities of a range of institutions interested in working in this area with the knowledge and experience present in industry will provide a strong platform to achieving this goal. The aim of the proposed consortium will be to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the PCI phenomena.

The method has also been demonstrated for composite UO2 pellets containing Mo. Work in underway to extend these findings to advanced fuels, notably uranium silicide.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We and others will extend these results to include advanced fuel materials, and will further explore the properties of fuels produced by this method. Some industrial collaborators (NNL, Westinghouse) will likely wish to consider how the technology can be extended to large-scale manufacture in tonne quantities, and to compare the economics of the process with established technologies, especially for advanced fuel types. Other partners (Rolls-Royce) may wish to explore the technology for other nuclear applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>90DD6265-0A7A-4315-AC42-48291B92974B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0bff681f355.27690533</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
