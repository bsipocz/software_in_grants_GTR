It focuses on the work and reception of the prolific Jewish sexologist and activist Magnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935), who is best known today for his homosexual rights activism, foundational studies of transvestism and opening of the world's first Institute of Sexual Sciences in Berlin. But Hirschfeld was also a chronicler of the effects of hate and violence against lesbians and homosexual men and other groups of people. Publishing both in German and English and influenced by his literary as well as medical training, he wrote, for example, about the death of Oscar Wilde and how it affected homosexual men at the turn of the last century; he conducted the first statistical surveys of lesbian and homosexual suicide; and he published books on war, nationalism and racism in which he collated evidence of different forms of collective discrimination and their impact on individual lives. A well-known figure amongst contemporary writers and artists, he was instrumental in the production of a series of films about aspects of sexual discrimination, famously starring in Anders als die Anderen [Different from the Others], a silent movie about homosexual blackmail released in German cinemas in 1919. Hirschfeld's homosexuality as much as his Jewishness, and his cultural activities as much as his political activism, were at the centre of several verbal and physical attacks on his life. Having travelled extensively between the 1890s and 1920s, he eventually left Germany for good in 1930 because of the increased threat of Nazi persecution. When he returned to Europe from a world lecturing tour two years later, Hirschfeld witnessed in a cinema in Paris news of the destruction of his Institute, which culminated in his bust being paraded through the streets of Berlin before it was set alight in the first of the Nazi book burnings. 

A Violent World of Difference excavates this complex archive for the insights it provides into the role of violence in the shaping of modern queer identity and culture. Engaging with the recent 'negative turn' in queer history - the focus on difficult experiences in the queer past and their legacies - and current scholarship on cultural politics, feelings and modernity, the research examines the narratives about lesbian and homosexual death, suicide, injury and persecution in Hirschfeld's work to show how such suffering was understood at the time. It brings together analyses of sexological literature, literary and popular culture, film and photography to demonstrate that traumatic experiences had a significant impact not only on the individuals subjected to them but also on the shaping of a wider modern queer culture. By paying attention to Hirschfeld's travels and the translations of his work, the project further traces the transnational contours of queer suffering, revealing that violent attacks on lesbians and homosexual men created emotional shockwaves that rippled far across the geopolitical boundaries of the modern world. In so doing, then, this research also tells a broader story about how 'identity' was experienced, transmitted, damaged and sustained in the transnational shaping of modernity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A core objective of this research is to engage with potential users and disseminate its findings beyond academia. The Fellowship begins and closes with two events aimed specifically at engaging 1. non-academic and 2. professional audiences (see also Pathways to Impact; Workplan): 

1. In February 2014 I will present a public talk on Hirschfeld hosted by the Raphael Samuel History Centre, a research and educational centre devoted to encouraging the widest possible participation in historical research and debate. Aimed at the local lesbian and gay community and the wider public, the talk is timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the LGBT History Month campaign, a UK-wide initiative that fosters public understanding of the diversity of queer life in the past and present. My talk will discuss Hirschfeld's contribution to the emergence of an international lesbian and gay rights movement and his role in pioneering transgender and intersex rights. It will use Hirschfeld's work to reflect on debates about equality and sexual rights, which are once more at the forefront of public and political discussions in the UK (where they focus on the recent introduction of gay marriage) and worldwide (where the criminalization and active persecution of homosexuality in over seventy countries remains a vital political concern). The Raphael Samuel History Centre has close links with London's queer communities and regularly attracts audiences of around 200 people to its public talks. According to feedback conducted on a recent queer themed event, 70% of its audience are non-academics. My talk will further be advertised via the BiGS mailing list, which has links with non-HEI networks such as Gay's the Word bookshop, the Birkbeck Alumni network, and the LGBT History month website. I will pitch a journalistic article based on this talk to the THE and propose shorter write-ups to the gay online magazine Polari, and the UK's popular lesbian magazine Diva, for which I have acted as a consultant in the past. 

2. In December 2014, the last month of the Fellowship, I will organize a workshop on Queer Suicide for health professionals and educators. Suicide was a major concern for Hirschfeld. From the evidence I found, he was the first modern doctor to pay detailed attention to lesbian and gay suicide, gathering statistical information and collecting an archive of suicide notes, many of which were directly addressed at him. The workshop will discuss this difficult archive with professionals whose job it is to provide advice and care for lesbian and gay people suffering from depression, anxieties and suicidal thoughts, or who teach the medical professionals dealing with these issues. It will draw on the Department's existing links via its MA in Medical Humanities (for which I have given guest lectures) with the Kent, Surrey and Sussex Deanery, and the links I developed with health professionals through my contribution to Critical Sexology (a seminar for humanities scholars and health and legal professionals). The workshop aims to initiate dialogue between humanities scholars and medical professionals to consider the usefulness of knowledge about the history of lesbian and gay suicide for health workers today (see Pathways to Impact for details of proposed contributors). I will submit a write-up of the event to the medical journal The Lancet, which in its 'Perspectives' section publishes brief non-medical papers on issues related to medical practice and research. 

The Fellowship would allow me to organize these activities while completing the research and writing for the monograph. The book will publicize an important archive of social, cultural and political attitudes towards queer women and men and document the emotional impact of the hate and persecution they experienced, 1900-1950. It will provide a valuable resource for academics and non-academic wishing to engage with the cultural history of violence against queer women and men.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91340</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>academic symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21B57415-D384-41C5-9DEC-5DFEDE50EC4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Homophobia Rewritten: New Literary and Cultural Perspectives on Violence and Sexuality, Keynes Library Birkbeck, 13 June, was a symposium I organised. It brought togetherr postgraduates, ECRs and established scholars from the UK whose work investigates cultural representations of homophobia and forms of resistance to it. The keynote was presented by Professor Alison Donnell (Reading University). 

The event stimulated academic discussion and led to the exchange of papers.

One of the issues that came up in the lead up to the event is that someone with a conviction for homophobic assault contacted me, expressing a wish to attend the event. In consultation with the university registrar, head of security and support from my School, we decided to close the event to the public to make it safe to attend. This sparked lively debate about homophobia in everyday and academic life including in relation to strategies on how to deal with it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>564330bbb57519.48342820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://violentworldofdifference.wordpress.com/tag/homophobia-rewritten/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with humanities scholars and medical professionals</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A84A391C-3542-4887-959A-98DA78BF71CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Violence in Queer and Trans Lives: A Dialogue Across the Humanities and Health Professions
I organised this workshop on 8 October 2014 to bring into dialogue researchers in the humanities and health professions, who, like me, work on the difficult aspects of queer and trans lives with one of the world's leading psychiatrists and expert on trans and intersex children and adolescents. The event aimed to explore what humanities and health researchers on queer and trans lives might learn from each other. The number of participants was deliberately kept small to maximise the potential for discussion and enable the identification of possible ways in which to develop this conversation further. Next to me, invited participants included:
--Vernon Rosario, a leading, UCLA-based, clinical psychiatrist - and trained historian of medicine - with special interest in trans, intersex and issues of gender and sexuality more broadly.
--Monalesia Earle, a social worker and PhD student working with me on a thesis about contemporary queer women of colour representation.
--Peter Hegarty, professor of psychology at the University of Surrey with special interests in gender and sexuality.
--Katherine Hubbard, a PhD student working on a project about Rorschach tests and the 'hidden' homophobic history of psychology
--Churnjeet Mahn, a literary scholar from Surrey's English Department, who is working on an AHRC funded project with young queer refugees.

The event opened an important dialogue with wider LGBT constituencies. It was booked to capacity (70 seats).

Several people came up to me after the talk, or emailed me later, to ask for further details about my research and share their own stories of growing up gay or transgender during the fifties, sixties, and seventies. It turned out that for many of them Hirschfeld's work had played a real role in developing understanding of their bodies and desires.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56432d004faa32.30539214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://violentworldofdifference.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/17-feb-2014-and-again-with-feeling-thoughts-on-different-from-the-others/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The activities below, which I organised as part of the award, indicate the kind of impact it already had and its potential for further impact development.

My project-related blog, A Violent World of Difference (http://violentworldofdifference.wordpress.com), has now had over 7,000, which indicates that my research continues to reach a significant online audience.

I have also contributed to as well as organised events that engage wider public audiences with my research on the history of homophobia. I was an invited participants in the Annual Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer History and Archives conference 2014, a public event held at the London Metropolitan Archives, where I led a public workshop on wills and queer legacies from the collection (c.100 attendees). 
More specifically, my findings have been used as part of an LGBT History event I organised for the general public in February 2014. Hosted in the Birkbeck Cinema, which was full to capacity, I screened the first pro-homosexual movie, Anders als die Andern/Different from the Others (1919), a silent film featuring Hirschfeld. This was followed by a panel discussion with experts in the histories of film, law and gender. According to a short questionnaire, which was filled in by around 50 members of the audience, the event introduced members of the public to new knowledge about the gay past, and in many cases changed their understanding of the past as it showed how love and community flourished even at times of persecution. Such changes in perception are important to changing persistent and pernicious cultural stereotypes that associate queer identities with lonely, misery lives.

A conference I organised, Homophobia Rewritten: New Literary and Cultural Perspectives of Sexuality and Violence, brought together PhD, ECR and established academics working on the cultural representations of homophobia and forms of resistance to it. The keynote speaker, Alison Donnell, recently completed an AHRC-funded project on the Caribbean Queer, bringing my work in dialogue with other research funded by the AHRC. An unexpected challenge here was that someone with a conviction for homophobic abuse wanted to attend the event. In a meeting with Birkbeck's registrar, a union member, the diversity officer, a member from HR and the manager of the School of Art it was decided to close the conference to the wider public for safety reasons. The conference was then able to go ahead as planned, featuring around 30 presenters and chairs and a special contingent of postgraduate participants. It was an extremely productive and successful conference, prompting much dialogue and cross-disciplinary exchange. A direct outcome has been that two of the postgraduates who met at the event, one from literature, one from psychology, are now collaborating on a project about (queer) women and comics. Furthermore, the circumstance that prompted the conference closure to the public indicates the importance of my research in helping to identify and challenge homophobia.

Finally, my findings have also been used to stimulate a workshop on Violence in Queer and Trans Lives: A Dialogue Between the Humanities and Health Professions. Here my work on the AHRC project provided the focal point of a discussion featuring next to me my PhD student Monalesia Earle, who is a social worker as well as an emerging expert in contemporary queer women of colour representation; the psychologist Peter Hegarty and his PhD Katherine Hubbard, who work on the homophobic history of psychology, Churnjeet Mahn, a literary scholar who is currently working on an AHRC funded project with young queer refugees, and Vernon Rosario, a clinical psychiatrist with an expertise in queer and trans issues. The event modelled how a dialogue between the humanities and the health professions may take shape. My research findings prompted Professor Rosario to consider the uses of historical research in his clinic, and I am exploring how this dialogue may be developed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD813A88-2D4B-453C-A0B9-5A6DB006C702</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545251b495b6a9.94752102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I am currently completing an AHRC-funded study, A Violent World of Difference: Magnus Hirschfeld and Queer Modernity. It analyses a neglected archive of cultural and scientific texts, film and photography from the first half of the twentieth-century. This archive was collected and partly produced by the physician and social reformer Hirschfeld (1868-1935), who aimed to document the effects of persecution, social rejection and physical attacks on lesbians, homosexual men and other people whose bodies and desires did not fit social norms.

My research to date has discovered new evidence that deepens understanding of the many ways in which queer lives came under attack. A key finding has been that homophobic violence not only impacted on the lives of the victims, but that it affected the queer women and men who directly or indirectly witnessed such attacks. I have found, for instance, that the trial and death of Oscar Wilde deeply affected other homosexual men including Hirschfeld himself who took part in memorial events for Wilde and used Wilde's tragic fate to support his campaigns for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Furthermore, I discovered that Hirschfeld was the first scientist to produce statistics of homosexual suicide, and so doing he significantly demonstrated that there is a connection between social ostracism and suicide.

I have also found, however, that the early homosexual rights movement had gendered boundaries as it often excluded women or misrepresented their concerns. Furthermore, I discovered that some of the early homosexual rights activists were implicated to varying degrees in the upholding of racial oppression and other forms of social injustice. 

In summary then, my findings to date have uncovered a hitherto 'hidden' archive that testifies to the suffering caused by homophobia and other forms of discrimination and persecution. I have also developed a better understanding of the exclusive boundaries of modern homosexual rights politics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have already been able to discuss some of my findings with health professionals and the wider public as well as with other scholars. These discussions indicate that there is a real need for, and interest in, learning about the difficult history of violence against lesbians, homosexual men and other queer people.
