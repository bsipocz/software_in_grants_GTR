We also have new ways of recognising pain and distress, and have a better understanding of how we can prevent these during research procedures. In order for this new understanding to have a real impact by refining animal research so that it is conducted in the most humane way, we need to disseminate information to research workers as widely as possible and in the most easily accessible way. 

The provision of training to all those involved in animal research is a key requirement in the new European Directive that controls animal research (2010/63/EU). This provides an excellent opportunity to incorporate &amp;quot;best practice&amp;quot; into the training of research workers throughout Europe. It is equally important that more advanced training is provided to those who need it, and that effective training materials (e.g. video demonstrations of procedures) are made available. Providing high quality educational materials is time-consuming, and so is often beyond the scope of individual institutions. This project will develop new training materials and new means of delivering them to individuals involved in research with laboratory animals. We will expand and update our current internet-based-training materials, and create new material for delivery both 'on-line', and as downloadable resources that can be incorporated into training courses run by individual research facilities. We will also develop tutorials on the new web site and will provide seminars on-line ('webinars').</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A strong evidence base for best practice in refinement has been developing over the last decade. However, effective dissemination and implementation of this information is difficult to achieve. This project will develop the infrastructure to underpin effective initial and continued training of individuals involved in animal-based research. We will build on the success of our current web-based materials and significantly expand this resource and provide a single internet portal to access training materials and other relevant information.

We will:

a) Update these existing resources to reflect current best practice and to incorporate new data from the peer-reviewed literature. 
b) Extend the delivery system to incorporate e-learning modules. 
c) Incorporate the resources into training materials provided on UK Home Office training modules, and elsewhere and integrate the new material into our specialist training courses in anaesthesia and pain and distress
d) Provide a new (webinar-based) method of delivery of these courses.

Training resources will be provided in two specific areas; the assessment and alleviation of pain and distress, and anaesthesia and perioperative care. We will also integrate the existing NC3Rs blood sampling microsite into the new website architecture. The combination of web-based information and e-learning tutorials, downloadable content for trainers, incorporation of support material for UK Home Office modular courses, and delivery via webinars and in &amp;quot;conventional&amp;quot; seminars and workshops will provide more effective dissemination of best practice in these areas. This will assist in the rapid introduction of refinements into many areas of research, and provide a framework for longer-term development of educational and training resources in laboratory animal science.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64555</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/L000873/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
