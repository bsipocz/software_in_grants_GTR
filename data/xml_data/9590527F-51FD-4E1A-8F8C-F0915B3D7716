World</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L003821/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Puritans were zealous Protestant activists who emerged as some of the most radical thinkers in early modern England. From their first appearance they were led by Presbyterians who agitated for a popular form of church government and were suspected of political sedition. This suspicion was later confirmed to some minds by those puritans who opposed the crown during the English civil wars. The official suppression of leading Presbyterians from the early 1590s was followed by nearly a half century of silence until their public resurgence in the mid-seventeenth century. Unpublished manuscripts in the library of Trinity College Dublin reveal an entirely new trajectory for the development of Puritanism and radical claims to independence during these four 'lost' decades. The manuscripts themselves represent the 'hidden' archive of Walter Travers, a leading Elizabethan ideologue. Some of these manuscripts are written in cypher, requiring careful decoding. My project will explore these materials and publish them, initially as an open access online resource targeted both at an academic and at a more general audience, and subsequently as a 250,000 word book with OUP. It will also explore the development of puritan claims to independence outside of Britain with ramifications for the wider world of Protestantism across Europe and the emerging American colonies. It is intended to speak not only to historians but to those interested more generally in the history of religious and political dissent.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While this project has a range of academic beneficiaries, it also has a direct relevance to the public. The concept of independence is not only crucial to current understanding of individual liberty but to virtually all political relationships in today's global society. Although the concept of liberty and independence is studied in national contexts (eg North America), there are few sources available to the public which explore how the concept of independence developed in Europe, Britain and America. 

Beneficiaries will therefore include:

(i) General Public: Research material emerging from this project will be made available to the public by a website devoted to the Independence Project. This will help to bridge the divide between academic and public knowledge of independence and liberty. It will provide a corrective to the lingering myth of American exceptionalism. 

(ii) Public Sector: This project draws extensively from newly identified manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin. The PI will establish a partnership with TCD to exhibit the manuscripts in their collection in the Long Room. 

(iii) Commercial: This fellowship will also involve a partnership with Michael Mendelsohn, CEO of Patriot Pictures, who believes such collaboration will be mutually beneficial. My initial meetings with the project partner have already proved fruitful and inspired a new module at UEA on 'Conspiracy and Crisis' which is related to the proposed research in this fellowship. The project partner has agreed to provide training in communicating this research to a public audience. He has also expressed interest in optioning the results for a feature film, commenting that the project has great commercial potential.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>182380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College Dublin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Independence Exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>21888163-B2EA-433C-9C4F-33F354FC86F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Physical and online exhibitions</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6021a2332a6.57679206-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Restoring of manuscripts and curating exhibition</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Director collaborating with the Library to launch a physical and online exhibition of manuscripts related to the Independence Project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rubicon Productions</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Discovering Independence</gtr:description><gtr:id>23BA0138-6CAB-4CDD-9B65-47108AC60582</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Television documentary</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d600bd7397c1.77372547-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Overseeing television documentary development through direction, production, etc.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Research team provided interviews for television documentary.

One of the program directors reported that the African fellows learned from our collaboration about the power of narrative to create positive social change. They embraced the notion that so many former African slaves created narratives of captivity and freedom to galvanize opposition to the slave trade. They had not before realized the centrality of black voices to the anti-slave trade and antislavery movements. They believed that this could be a model for them in their respective African countries. They want to use the power of stories to mobilize youth and minority populations to effect change. They see narratives as being useful in two contexts-one, to emphasize the shared cultural narratives, ie, the founding of their nation, religious narratives, etc. as a way to overcome factionalism and tribalism. And two, they see focusing on individual stories, rather than general policy and vague argument, as the way to engender support for change. They recognize that people will gravitate toward stories of freedom/triumph as examples that resonate emotionally with constituents and inspire them to want to make reforms. For example, one young woman who works on girl's and women's rights said she would like to use narratives of triumph-survival of domestic abuse or examples of successful women leaders-to mobilize support for her cause. Another example was a fellow who is working to mobilize the youth vote-he wanted to focus on specific narratives, primarily examples of young legislators who were trying to challenge older oligarchs in their parliament.

This inspired these African leaders to make more use of narrative in their initiatives for pursuing social justice in their respective countries. 

The editorial board of the Journal of History of Ideas invited us to publish a special issue in their journal based on the proceedings of our meeting. They intend to make this available to the general public through open access, which will be a first for the journal and represent a significant step in making intellectual history accessible to broader audiences.

The open access special issue is intended to coincide with national broadcast in the US of a television documentary featuring the PI's research at Trinity College Dublin and interviews from the team of experts who met at Monticello. This documentary is currently under development with Rubicon Productions, an Emmy award winning team specialising in historical programming in the US.

In June 2016 the project is also partnering with Trinity College Dublin Library to launch a public exhibition featuring the manuscripts at the heart of this research project. An online exhibition will outlive the physical one, which attracts over 500,000 international viewers annually.

Research findings, articles and further expert interviews will remain available to the public through the project website for at least the next thirty years at: historyofindependence.com</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5AAEBE59-F440-47E7-8777-C5389020D9BB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d8b6ad1479f1.53516759</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Independence introduced a new way of thinking about freedom as the absence of arbitrary interference. As an icon of American identity, the Declaration of Independence represents the first national 'birth certificate' of its kind. It has since become a global story with over half the countries in the world declaring their own Independence. 

According to the historical record, Independent freedom was supposed to have suddenly burst into the English speaking world with the outbreak of the English Civil Wars during the mid-1640s. However, the project's research on a collection of manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin Library reveals that it was actually born over the course of extensive debates which took place underground for nearly half a century before it was supposed to exist. 

Trinity College Dublin Library's 'Magna Carta' of Independence provides a key to understanding and reinterpreting this central concept of freedom in the modern world. Whilst it belonged to the same family of ideas as the ancient classical world, it transformed that tradition by grounding independence in the new testament scriptures.

? This allowed freedom to become universally applicable, cutting across social rank and gender. 

? This represented a crucial step towards the democratization of knowledge by recognizing individuals (including women) as arbiters of spiritual and political matters. 

? Moving beyond theories of resistance, this document legitimized the creation of entirely new societies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-National and international policy makers
