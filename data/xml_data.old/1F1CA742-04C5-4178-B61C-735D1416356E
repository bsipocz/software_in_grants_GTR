Moreover, among university students, inequalities continue to emerge with differences in dropout rates, degree class and labour market outcomes by socio-economic status. Any policy aimed at reducing inequality in university outcomes can only be successful if the underlying mechanisms are clearly understood. This proposal aims to understand how differences by socio-economic status in perceptions about own academic ability, beliefs about the factors to success at university, willingness to take risk and invest in the future, access to information and job search strategy contribute to inequality in university attainment and labour market outcomes of university graduates in the UK.

We first propose to use linked administrative data to provide a comprehensive description of the association between parental socio-economic status and dropout rates, degree class, employment, earnings, and participation in post-graduate education in the UK over the last decade. We then propose to explore specific mechanisms for the emergence of these inequalities and evaluate interventions that could reduce them. Earlier literature points to several factors which may undermine disadvantaged students' success at university. Students from disadvantaged groups tend to be more present-biased and less likely to plan ahead and invest in the future; they tend to have less information about their own academic ability and other relevant aspects of university outcomes; and they tend to have social networks containing more people in unemployment or on benefits. 

By conducting a new field experiment on a cohort of university students, we aim to assess whether interventions aimed at providing new information about the relationship between university outcomes and labour market outcomes, and at changing students' time perspective (i.e. the tendency to live in the past or only for the moment), modify students' beliefs, preferences, working habits, job search strategy and ultimately impact their academic and labour market outcomes. Using secondary data analysis, we will also explore whether early performance in university exams affects dropout and degree class differently by socio-economic characteristics, and examine whether socio-economic differences in access to social networks and local labour markets are partly responsible for inequality in employment and earnings. 

This proposal is highly innovative on several dimensions. It employs a variety of methods, such as randomised experiments, specifically intended to uncover causal relationships. It analyses several different datasets, including linked administrative records, a new field study involving panel surveys, and qualitative interviews. It adopts a multidisciplinary approach, combining models of decision making from economics and psychology and collecting measures of expectations, preferences, and other important individual traits. Most importantly, it focuses on the mechanisms through which, and the levels at which, inequalities in university attainment and labour market outcomes occurs and evaluate specific interventions: it therefore is ideally placed to provide concrete policy recommendation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries from this research include:
- Young people in the UK, and especially those from underprivileged background, who could achieve better university outcomes conditional on participating in higher education. 
- Civil servants, politicians and other policy-makers. Our research will directly evaluate the impact of two specific interventions aiming at improving higher education outcomes (including employment) of UK undergraduates, and will inform policy makers about the type of support that youths from disadvantaged backgrounds most need, and when the best time to provide support is. It will therefore provide valuable information that enables policy makers to review and improve their current policies and strategies. Our findings will be of direct relevance to - and inform policy decisions of - officials in the Department for Education, the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills, the Child Poverty Unit (which seeks to raising the achievement of disadvantaged children), the Equality and Human Rights Commission (which seeks to promote fairness and equal opportunity in the UK's future economy) and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
- Data owners, such as HESA, and DfE. Our analyses require the use of linked administrative datasets, the creation and validation of longitudinal identifiers (HESA Student Records), the use of consistent indicators of attainment and socio-economic status over time. We will work in partnership with these data owner organizations to create resources which will be of long-lasting value to the wider research community. 
- Practitioners and non-governmental organisations. Our project will benefit think-tanks and non-governmental organisations with an interest in higher education policy. As well as the Early Intervention Foundation, with which we are already in contact with, these include the Sutton Trust, Child Poverty Action Group, the Resolution Foundation. Interested practitioners include universities (in particular the University of Essex and the University of Leeds), including for example widening participation offices, and secondary school teachers and managers. They will gain a greater understanding of the type of interventions that can help improve access and university outcomes from young people from disadvantaged groups. 
- Media/the general public. We anticipate that the outputs of this project will be of interest, as issues related to inequality in higher education are popular topics with the media. Many people will relate to, or have an opinion about, our findings, so the public will benefit from a discourse about these topics.
- The academic community. Our findings will interest other academics working on higher education in the UK and elsewhere, on human capital investment and on inequality. They will also interest academics with a methodological interest in the use of new data (such as the combination of field and lab experiments). 
- The members of the project team. All researchers in this project will benefit from rehearsing and applying advanced analytical methods, and being involved in survey design and fieldwork. Skill development will also occur through interactions with government departments, third sector organisations and conference proceedings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>784519</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This 10-minute video presents the following information:
People's brains adapt and grow in response to learning opportunities. Example given from a study showing the size of key parts of the brain increased following language training.
? Structure of the brain, neurons, dendrites and synapses. New imaging techniques show that the structure of a neuron is not fixed, and new dendritic spines can grow quickly.
? This teaches us that we should think of the brain as a muscle: It grows with exercise. The more you challenge your brain to learn, retain and retrieve new information, the more dendritic spines you physically grow, the more you revisit the new connections you make, and the longer they will stay.
? Example: Study in which training one area of the brain using a computer game leads to improvements in other cognitive domains, that persisted for over one year.
? Mistakes and challenges are really important for learning. When you are finding something difficult, it is not that you are reaching the limits of your ability, but an opportunity to train your brain to get stronger in that area by creating new neurons or new connections.
? Example: brain activity highest after a mistake, but this is only true for those who believed that ability can grow. If you belief your ability is not fixed, you can learn from your mistakes.
? A poor mark does not mean you have low ability. You can train your brain to grow.
? This means the most effective kind of study is where you challenge yourself, giving four study tips:
o Testing. [Expand on this after: Writing notes, using flashcards, completing past papers, or using textbook questions. This is a form of active learning. More passive methods are only good for encoding information in memory the first time]
o Spacing. [Study time on a particular topic is better distributed among several sessions. It last longer and more brain connections get formed. Material reviewed several times stays in the memory much longer. Cramming might feel effective but doesn't give the brain the opportunity to store information in long term memory]
o Attending lectures and classes. [Especially complemented with note-taking and reading assignments].
o Avoiding bad situations. [Stress and lack of sleep inhibits formation of new brain cells and encoding of new information. Distractions like music or checking one's phone consume part of working memory so prevent encoding of information. Exercise improves blood flow to the brain]</gtr:description><gtr:id>5ECFBCCD-8C66-4540-A61A-69F210E3AF1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video was presented to half of the students enrolled in the BOOST cohort.
