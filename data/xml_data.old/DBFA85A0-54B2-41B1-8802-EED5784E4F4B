&lt;p>The witness provides a description and selects from a large database of examples the facial features that best match their memory of the offender. Good quality facial composites can provide investigative leads. However, laboratory research shows that participants generally produce composites bearing a poor resemblance to the target person, with composites created using traditional UK systems identified only about 20 per cent&amp;nbsp;of the time under favourable conditions. Two simple techniques have been developed by the co-investigator to improve composite quality:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>introducing a 30 minute delay between the face description and composite construction;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>asking the witness to attribute personality characteristics to the target's face (eg, masculinity, pleasantness). &lt;/li>

&lt;p>This project will evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in improving composite quality with relation to two variables of importance to real-world forensic settings: &lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>the delay between seeing a target face and constructing a composite;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether the witness knows (or does not know) to attend to the target's face.&lt;/li>

This workshop brought together specialists from across the UK in facial composite research to discuss:

? Who makes a good witness?

? When is the best time to make a facial composite?

? What is the value of an accidental witness?

? What are the best questions to ask the witness?

? What techniques during facial composite construction lead to a better likeness?

? How should composites be best displayed in the media?

Forty-five practitioners registered for the event, with 37 able to attend. Officers received funding to attend from their forces. In a follow-up survey 19/19 respondents reported finding the workshop useful for their job and 95% would recommend the workshop to a colleague.

Following the workshop a subset of operators reported using the Holistic-Cognitive Interview (H-CI) technique with witnesses. Those not using the technique reported that they lacked understanding and confidence in what was required. This suggests that hands-on training sessions to promote the H-CI would be useful.

Good quality composites can generate leads when a suspect has not been identified, and there is evidence that composites are used extensively. For example, based on feedback about one system we estimated that across 14 UK police forces 3000 composites have been constructed over 5 years. This project improves our knowledge of how to best create recognisable composites with witnesses and victims, and thus will contribute to the increased identification of offenders and the lowering of crime. Primarily, the effectiveness of two techniques previously identified as enhancing a witness's ability to produce a recognisable composite were evaluated when approximating conditions typical of forensic situations: (1) asking a witness to attribute personality characteristics to the face of the perpetrator they image in memory prior to composite construction (the H-CI); and (2) inserting a 30-minute delay between the witness seeing the perpetrator and producing a composite. The findings highlight the importance of examining the specific characteristics of a witness's statement about their memory: Obtaining information about their self-reported intention to remember the perpetrator, the length of the retention interval and assessing the amount of information they have recalled about the face, can prove useful in deciding whether applying these techniques are likely to improve or impair composite quality. We have also showed that changing the way in which composites are viewed by potential recognisers can improve the likelihood that those composites are successfully named. Viewing composites side-on, the perceptual stretch technique, improved recognition of composites under some conditions and appears to be a promising technique to apply in forensic situations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7604B258-6172-4014-9686-9FEC16AF9D4B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54457d73dc9bf4.05264952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An eyewitness may produce a visual likeness of an offender. Good quality facial composites prompt recognition by people familiar with the offender. However, research shows that feature-based composite systems, still in extensive use worldwide, generally produce poor likenesses. In standard police practice an eyewitness describes the offender using a Cognitive Interview (CI). This description is then used to select facial features (e.g. narrow noses) from a database and the witness chooses those that best match their memory (e.g. eyes, nose). Describing facial features can interfere with face recognition, perhaps because recognition is best achieved by emphasizing holistic properties of the face. This project examined the effectiveness of two techniques proposed to overcome this problem when using feature-based composite systems. First, following a (face-recall) CI, attributing personality characteristics to the face, thereby focusing on the whole face, can improve composite quality. Our results indicate this Holistic-Cognitive Interview (H-CI) is likely to be effective when the witness reports having attended to the perpetrator during the crime and/or provides a good level of detail about the face. In these circumstances, we found that the H-CI worked when administered 2 days after encoding the target, a delay typical in criminal investigations. Second, inserting a 30 minute delay between CI and composite construction was assumed to allow interference from describing a face to subside, leading to the production of a better facial likeness. However, when interviewed after 2 days, we found worse quality composites were produced with a 30 minute delay between interview and construction, an unexpected finding. We have since found in further research that the detriment of a 30 minute delay between interview and construction to also extend to a holistic-based system. We further illustrate how a novel technique for presenting composites (a perceptual stretch technique that involves showing the facial composite angled to the side) can increase the likelihood that composites are successfully recognised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel techniques for improving the quality of facial composites produced by witnesses using a typical modern feature-based composite system. The benefits of both techniques required replication and their effectiveness under more forensically-relevant conditions had not yet been tested. The findings have contributed to both theory and practice. They have provided important information concerning when the police should use these techniques with witnesses to improve composite quality. Data arising from our project have allowed us to make specific recommendations to relevant practitioners within the police concerning: (1) when use of the Holistic-Cognitive Interview (H-CI) with witnesses is likely to be most effective, and (2) that further benefit from the H-CI can be obtained by circulating the finished composite using a perceptual stretch technique (i.e. showing the facial composite angled to the side). Importantly, we have shown that this technique benefits the recognition of composites created with both feature-based and holistic-based composite systems. Notably, the results indicate that memory strength for the target face is important in determining the success of the Holistic-Cognitive Interview (H-CI) for improving composite quality. If a witness struggles to recall the face then it is likely they will be unable to apply the H-CI as intended and will not benefit from its use. Our work further indicated that inserting a 30 minute delay between the face description (elicited using a CI) and constructing a feature-based composite to be detrimental to composite quality. We have since found this detrimental effect to extend to a holistic-based composite system. Thus describing a face does not necessarily interfere with the ability to produce a composite, and may in fact be useful for composite construction if undertaken immediately before (for both feature and holistic-based systems). Our on-going work is directed at further understanding how these interview techniques work and how to tailor (1) the interview; (2) the composite system; and (3) the presentation format of the final composite to best aid witnesses to produce recognisable composites from both feature and holistic-based systems under varying forensic conditions. For example, during 2016 we have gathered data from the general public (visitors to the National Media Museum, Bradford) on their perceived effectiveness of a cut-down version of a holistic-composite system. Visitors watched a film of a staged crime and by following instructions on the screen were guided through the process of creating a composite of the perpetrator. Overall, 5,800 composites were created and the mean rating given by visitors as to how alike the composite seemed to their memory of the perpetrator was 2.8 (on a scale of 1, low likeness to 5, high likeness). Thus, despite working through relatively few selection and breeding screens, and the absence of any detailed artwork additions to the composite, visitors seemed to be positive about the composite produced. Further work can now investigate whether streamlining the full composite system to make it less time-intensive for police officers to administer can lead to composites that are effectively recognised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18A9705E-42C7-403D-BFFF-F27C3FEEDC5A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7360942184.32991b2f2c81e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to the training of facial composite operators within the police</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FEB0CFE0-DD3D-4776-AB54-C2F884A5B204</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our grant based work evaluated the effectiveness of a quick to administer interview technique (the Holistic-Cognitive Interview, H-CI). This technique had previously been shown to improve the identification of composites within the laboratory setting and we set about evaluating this technique under laboratory conditions that were more relevant to the forensic setting. Our findings demonstrated that the H-CI is likely to be of benefit when a witness reports trying to remember the face during the crime, when there is a short delay between seeing the face and composite construction, or when the witness provides a fairly detailed face description. The grant based work predominantly focused on a feature-based composite system (PRO-fit). However, a recent meta-analysis, confirms the effectiveness of the H-CI across both feature (E-fit, PRO-fit and Sketch) and holistic-based composite systems (Evofit) (Frowd et al., 2015, Journal of Forensic Practice). Shortly following the grant end we surveyed police officers in their use of the H-CI following a training workshop including 37 composite operators from 13 forces. Those not using the technique reported that they lacked understanding and confidence in what was required. This suggested to us that hands-on training sessions to promote the H-CI would be useful. Approximately one hundred police personnel across 10 UK forces have now been trained in how to use the H-CI. Training has also been extended to police forces in Romania, Israel and the US (Boston). Feedback remains positive: it is used as a matter of course with witnesses and victims provided that verbal recall of the face is fairly substantive, and operatives think that the witness can suitably understand the two additional memory aids making up the H-CI. We have provided a short guide for police operatives outlining use of the H-CI which is publically available at the following link: http://www.evofit.co.uk/training-support/.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d995b5a3a8b2.46223883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Practical, evidence-based information for improving how composites are produced and subsequently used to catch criminals.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DD75233-8E5F-4539-89D6-424ED0DCF073</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54458d9a3c8f82.12595812</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Our grant based work showed that asking participants to turn a facial composite to the side, thereby viewing the composite side-on (the perceptual stretch technique), improved the likelihood that composites constructed with a feature-based composite system 2 days after seeing the perpetrator would be successfully recognised. A 2 day delay before composite construction is typical in forensic investigations, and we suggested that applying this technique as standard is likely to be advantageous. Further, we also demonstrated the combined effectiveness of the Holistic-Cognitive Interview technique and perceptual stretch for both a feature-based (PRO-fit) and holistic-based (EvoFIT) system. This benefit of perceptual stretch has now been independently shown to generalise to two alternative composite systems (EFIT-V, a holistic system and E-FIT a feature-based system) by an alternative laboratory (Davis, 2015, Journal of Forensic Practice). However, feedback we gathered from individual operators expressed concern that publicising this technique may invite ridicule and undermine public engagement. Therefore a Perceptual Backdrop Image was created. This presents a composite image against a perceptual backdrop so that it can be presented directly to the viewer, without asking them to angle the composite. It has the same effect on the visual appearance of the image as physically turning the composite to the side. Software has been developed to allow a perceptual backdrop image to be produced as a standard output from EvoFIT and the same effect can easily be achieved using Photoshop for composites generated with other composite systems (e.g., PRO-Fit, EFIT-V, E-FIT). This has proved more acceptable to composite operators. Using a perceptual backdrop also ensures that the perceptual effect we are striving for is maintained (and the image is not altered) when images are published by alternative outlets other than the police (e.g., in newspapers).</gtr:description><gtr:id>45230F51-1DBC-47FA-8A65-37DB35A28969</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Police Service of Northern Ireland have been using the Perceptual Backdrop Image extensively when circulating composites for identification both within and external to their force.
