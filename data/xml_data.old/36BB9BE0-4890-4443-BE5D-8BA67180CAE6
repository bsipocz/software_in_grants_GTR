It is the original home of the famous tale of 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' and this gives the flavour of the whole. In its other engaging tales a Babylonian miraculously blasts snakes with his scorching breath; a Hyperborean mage draws a woman to her admirer with an animated cupid doll; a Jewish sorcerer exorcises a demon; an animated statue punishes a thief; and is mistakenly taken down to the underworld before his time before being returned to life; and a Pythagorean cleanses a haunted house of its monstrous ghost.The importance of the text, to which no monograph or commentary has been devoted in English, is threefold:1. Many of the Philopseudes' anecdotes constitute telling examples of traditional story-types (oral and literary) or folktales. Analogues may be found for the various tales in other ancient pagan texts, in early hagiography, and in the wider western tradition. But the Philopseudes' tales often constitute, crucially, the earliest attested examples of their story-type, for all that they are heavily reshaped by Lucian's satirical (and other) considerations.2. The Philopseudes' tales are of the highest importance for the study of ancient magic and magical lore, and for the study of beliefs about ghosts in the ancient world, fields that currently attract enormous (although often substandard) scholarly attention.3. The Philopseudes is a strategically important text within Lucian's satirical oeuvre, with significant affinities with many of his other pieces, whether devoted to symposia, fantasy, philosophy, charlatanry or 'Menippean' underworld themes. It is a text also with some strong affinities to the wider literature of the Second Sophistic, notably Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana, and it also salutes a great many canonical Classical texts.The purpose of this monograph project is to elucidate the structures and themes of the traditional tales that constitute the body of the text and, thereby, to appreciate Lucian's handling of them. The investigation fundamentally addresses two questions in counterpoise: What does an understanding of the traditional form (or forms) of the tales with which Lucian works tell us of his art and the strategies with which he has manipulated the material? And what does an understanding of Lucian's art, the stock-in-trade of recurring themes and the portfolio of agendas on display in his wider oeuvre, allow us to know (by a sort of subtraction) of the traditional form or forms of the tales with which he works?Each of the ten tales is considered in turn, with its own devoted chapter. In the case of each tale we begin by reconstructing from various sources (often subsequent to Lucian) the story-type with which the author works. We then seek to account for the modifications Lucian has brought to the story-type in his narrative. A diverse range of criteria is appealed to, including Lucian's immediate satirical project, the Lucianic stock-in-trade, allusion to canonical texts, and, most importantly, the knowing manipulation of themes from the lore of magic and ghosts. A discursive style of exegesis has been preferred to a line-by-line commentary format only after agonised reflection. When a commentary was initially contemplated it became apparent that the level at which the bulk of discussion was needed was the anecdote as a whole rather than the 'line'. Much of what is interesting and important about this text relates to the structure of its ancedotes and their relationship to analogue tales in other Lucianic and extra-Lucianic texts, and such issues can not be handled efficiently if the units of discussion are too granulated.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23134</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D000394/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
