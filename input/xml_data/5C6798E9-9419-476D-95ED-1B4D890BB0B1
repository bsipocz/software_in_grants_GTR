With Japanese cultural products exported on a global scale, Japanese notions of gender reach a worldwide audience, and it is therefore important to examine representations of gender and women's issues in contemporary Japan. The literary works of Japanese author Murakami Haruki, which have been translated into over 40 languages, attract such a broad global readership that they have inspired creators of cultural products such as film makers, artists, computer game programmers and dance choreographers, culminating with Times recognising Murakami as one of the world's 100 most influential people in 2015. This research project takes advantage of Murakami's international recognition to examine representations of gender and female characters in his widely read stories.

The project will carry out a comprehensive socio-cultural and literary analysis of gender and female characters across Murakami's stories, using not only the original Japanese literary texts and their English translations, but also transmedial productions including art, film and dance. The few existing criticisms of gender in Murakami's works have concluded that his worlds mirror Japanese patriarchy and that his female characters, as products of a male writer, are depicted as sexualised objects. This project challenges such previous conclusions. By exploring Murakami's works in the context of Japanese feminism and women's literature, this project uncovers his literary worlds beyond those of the lonesome male narrator-ones his global readers know so well-where female characters, protagonists and narrators are subjects in their own right. The processes of translation and transmedial production will also be intensely investigated to reveal the gender possibilities available to worldwide consumers beyond the Japanese text.

This highly interdisciplinary project reaches far beyond Japanese studies. Researchers specialising in disciplines as diverse as literature, gender, popular culture, translation and socio-cultural studies will directly benefit from the research. Furthermore, given Murakami's global influence and transmedial reach, this project also has excellent potential to achieve economic and societal impact among wide groups of beneficiaries beyond academia. In addition to general Murakami readers, these include the public sector and international organisations with an interest in current Japanese affairs, the commercial sector specialising in publishing and translation, artists and creators of cultural products, and the media outlets covering topics on Murakami, Japanese literature and contemporary Japan.

A series of project-related activities will be held in Newcastle to broadly engage as many potential beneficiaries as possible: a gallery installation of artistic interpretations by artists inspired by Murakami, film screenings of five adaptations and one documentary, a Murakami-focused translation workshop, a dance performance inspired by Murakami's breakthrough novel, Norwegian Wood, and an academic conference to conclude the events. Each activity will be open to the public, encouraging network building and paving the way for new knowledge and collaboration among diverse people with a common interest in Murakami.

The findings from this project will be effectively disseminated through several conference papers, culminating with two publications: first, a book with publisher Palgrave Mcmillan aimed at both academics and general readers, and second, an edited special issue on Murakami in the peer-reviewed journal Japan Forum. Besides disseminating research on Japan's most well-known author, this project leverages the high interest in Murakami as a unique opportunity to enhance knowledge to UK and international audiences on gender, women and Japan.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Murakami Haruki's literary works are a global source of entertainment and artistic inspiration. This provides the proposed project with excellent potential to achieve both economic and societal impact beyond academic communities. The PI has identified the following five main groups of beneficiaries that are likely to benefit from the proposed research project:

1) The public sector and international organisations 
Recognising the export potential of Japanese cultural products to the global market, in 2010 the Japanese government set up the Creative Industries Promotion Office within the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Under the concept 'Cool Japan', the government has since then actively participated in the export of culture. With Murakami as the leading Japanese writer, government funded organisations such as the Japan Foundation will benefit from the project because such organisations can leverage the established appeal (Murakami) of the research outputs to increase the effectiveness of their aim to enhance knowledge on Japanese culture (literature) and issues concerning Japan (gender).

2) The commercial/private sector
Translators and non-Japanese publishers of Murakami's works will benefit from the research because the project provides a platform (translation workshop) from which they can exchange experiences with translating Murakami's works. This will likely facilitate the creation of networks between international translators, funders and publishers of translated Japanese literature, which may lead to future translations of Japanese literature beyond Murakami, thereby benefitting the sector economically and creatively.

3) The third sector
Murakami's literary works have inspired many artists and cultural producers. Offering this group an opportunity to display their works (via the gallery, film screenings and dance performance) to academic and non-academic audiences will catalyse new collaborations and creative outputs. In turn, this may foster artistic and economic benefits for individuals (by increasing sales, contracts and funding) and institutions (by increasing visitor numbers to new exhibitions).

4) The media
International media have long found that stories about Murakami sell-in 2013, the national Japanese newspaper Asahi Shinbun established an ongoing special section in their online English edition entitled 'Chasing Haruki Murakami'. The project will benefit this group of journalists, allowing them to refine their investigative outputs by connecting his literature to issues concerning gender and women in Japan and elsewhere.

5) The wider general public
The project offers potential societal impact to Murakami readers around the world. The global interest in Murakami will function as a doorway to reach people who may otherwise have little interest in gender and women's issues. The research therefore has the potential to shift people's attitudes, awareness and understanding regarding some of the most important problems currently faced by the government, policymakers and the people of Japan, the world's third largest economy and soft power nation. Such change and awareness can extend beyond the Japanese socio-cultural context too; understanding a foreign culture encourages people to reference and compare with their own culture and the project can in that way increase awareness about gender and women's issues internationally, for example in the UK.

In addition to facilitating information on Japan's most well-known author, this project leverages the high interest in Murakami as a unique opportunity: while the project enhances knowledge to UK and international audiences on gender, women and Japan, it also provides international networking opportunities through its scheduled series of activities in the North East of England. The project can therefore contribute to advancing the local area's economic competitiveness within the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160357</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005322/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18BE3C84-714B-4BEC-A5E9-B1F27D03EA79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asiatic &amp; Oriental Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
