His entry in the city's burial registers not only tells us his cause of death, but also provides information about his status, father, age, medical treatment prior to his death, parish of residence, and the family members and ecclesiastical personnel involved in his burial. Adjacent to this description is a drawing of the unfortunate Rinaldi being bitten by the dog.\n\nBurial registers have long been used by demographic historians to reveal patterns of mortality and the impact of mortality crises on populations, particularly in the context of plague. My project on 'Death in early modern Venice and Nuremberg' will analyse why the Venetian authorities compiled such detailed burial registers, and consider how the Venetian records fit into a broader European development of increasingly detailed monitoring of the mortality of populations by early modern elites. It will build on demographic studies to situate their findings in a broader cultural context by analysing the meaning of the language used to describe death, and the significance of visual representations of causes of mortality.\n\nInspired by cultural history, it will draw attention to the meaning of individual deaths - like that of Rinaldi - and evaluate how these deaths were experienced communally. A key area of investigation will be the rituals of funerals and burials. By evaluating these themes in comparative perspective through detailed case studies of death in a Lutheran and a Catholic context, this project will shed new light on the impact of religious change on death at this time. The project will reshape our understanding of the intersection between political and religious authority and personal experience in a key period of transition in European history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is a general public interest in the topic of death, as it is a universal human experience. Beyond the scholarly community, the media and the wider public in general will be the main beneficiaries of my research. These benefits will be transmitted via two routes: media coverage of my research, and my participation - as a project team member - in a projected public engagement project entitled 'You are what you ate: food lessons from the past'. The latter project will be focused on the region of Yorkshire, and will benefit many members of the local community, particularly children, youth groups, and members of different religions and cultures.\n\nDeath has been a topic of considerable public interest in the Venetian context, due to a recent archaeological excavation of the city's Lazaretto Vecchio (old pest-house). This project received regular coverage in Venice's regional and local newspapers, Il Gazzettino and La Nuova di Venezia e Mestre; the excavation of mass plague graves was also mentioned in National Geographic News. Interest in the excavations rocketed in the spring of 2009 with the putative discovery of a Venetian vampire: the skull of a woman buried with a brick in her mouth. This received international media coverage (UK (including BBC, New Scientist, National Geographic, Telegraph, Metro); US (ABC, Fox News, Huffington Post); China (China Daily)). In January 2010, I was contacted by a BBC researcher who had read this story and wanted to learn more about burial sites and plague in Venice, demonstrating continued media interest in this field.\n\nThis research will have an impact on the culture of Italy and the UK. My detailed study of Venetian mortality will permit a more nuanced understanding of the recently-excavated archaeological material. My research will permit a definitive assertion that there is no supporting documentary evidence for beliefs that plague victims were feared as vampires, as has been asserted by an anthropologist associated with the excavation. My research will highlight other significant beliefs in religion and the supernatural in the context of death and share these with a broad audience. I anticipate that this impact will be realised within two years of the completion of the project.\n\nMoreover, my research has the potential to have an impact on the nation's health. My involvement in the 'Food lessons' project will comprise delivery of a public workshop to adults, entitled 'Eating yourself to death', which will draw on my research to highlight how death could ensue from overeating, obesity, 'holy' anorexia, malnutrition and dietary deficiency. These issues have a broader resonance in today's society, and the workshop will inspire reflection on our eating habits today, by eliciting similarities and differences between present and past. This impact will take place within the timeframe of the larger project, which will run for 36 months from June 2010.\n\nThe opportunity for those outside the scholarly community to benefit from this research will be significantly enhanced by my track record of designing and leading widening participation and outreach sessions. This has enabled me to develop my ability to deliver accessible, interactive and inclusive events. In addition, I will ensure that I cultivate relationships with the media by initiating and sustaining communication with journalists, and by publicising a detailed account of my research on my institutional webpage to encourage public and media enquiries. The efficacy of the public engagement project will be enhanced by the detailed programme of project management and evaluation which has been designed into the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Collaborative exhibition drawing on the research of several researchers at the University of Leeds.

Interpreting mortality in early modern Venice. Death registers from Venice, Milan and Mantua were analysed, with an innovative focus on their qualitative characteristics. This study found significant similarities in the format and method of composition of these registers. In addition, their content was shaped by legislative stipulations in all three cities. Variation in the content of the registers was significant with regard to references to medical practitioners and to burials. Iconographic representations of death scarcely featured in the Milanese registers, involved greater celebration of high status individuals in Mantua, and encompassed the greatest range of causes of death in Venice. These differences reflect the divergent priorities of each city's civic authorities. The study found that these registers contributed to a burgeoning mass of paperwork about health and disease which reflected a broader appreciation of the value of communication in the public health context.

2. Burying the dead: funerals, cemeteries and religious reform in early modern Europe. A comparative analysis of funerals and cemeteries in Lutheran Nuremberg and Catholic Venice unearthed unexpected results. The research hypothesis for this project posited confessional difference as the primary cause of differing approaches to burying the dead in these two contexts. While religious convictions did shape burial practices, the socio-political context emerged as a greater influence on practices. Most notably, rituals of death were affected by the relative importance of certain families in the Nuremberg context, whereas Venice's unique political system meant that the personal rather than political significance of family was more marked. Civic preoccupations with spaces of death also took different forms. In Nuremberg, the uniformity of graves in Nuremberg was a priority, whereas in Venice, overcrowded cemeteries were a public health problem to be tackled. Finally, although funeral orations are usually associated with the Protestant context, oral and written modes of memorialisation also featured in death rituals in Venice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1.
