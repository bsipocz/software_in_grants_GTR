The evolution of portable and handheld devices in the past two decades has further augmented the pervasiveness of electronics into our daily activities. In general, the majority of modern electronic products require a heterogeneous set of components. These products include common portable devices or sophisticated systems used in medicine and industry for safety, monitoring, prevention, or therapy. This system heterogeneity will be intensified in the future, since the primary demand for faster processing of the information is augmented by the requirement for accurate sensing and detection of environmental stimuli.
Although these devices have created a flourishing market, the design of high performance and low power computing systems beyond consumer demands remains an omnipresent challenge. The design of more powerful computers is driven not only by the need to answer important scientific questions but also to address new or on-going societal needs. A characteristic example is the data-centers which they offer a variety of services but the relating energy-cost is increasing at an alarming rate. To mitigate these issues scientists and researchers explore disruptive technologies. A promising technology is three-dimensional (3-D) or vertical integration. This emerging technology has appealed to both industry and academia for several reasons. For example, considering the case of portable products, a vertically integrated system can drastically reduce the size of the board, which hosts the various components, by stacking these subsystems into a multi-tier structure reducing the overall size and improving power consumption.
This project will contribute to the evolution of vertically integrated systems by providing new design techniques and innovative analysis tools for the power distribution network of these systems. To better explain the complexity as well as the significance of this task, consider the power grid that supplies our residences. A similar yet severely constrained grid provides current to each transistor within an integrated circuit. The design complexity of this network for vertical multi-tier circuits is much higher similar to the case where the electric installation of a multi-storey building is much more complicated than that of a house. The scale of the problem where billion of &amp;quot;consumers&amp;quot; (i.e. transistors) must be provided with abundant current underlines the need for faster and accurate analysis methods. In this project, the analysis will be complemented by optimization methods, as the resources for the power network are limited and compete with other resources. Using our civic analogy, think of a situation where phone and power cables compete for a limited open space.
Efficient solutions to this problem cannot resort solely to existing design methodologies and/or numerical techniques due to the size of the problem as well as the heterogeneity of the envisioned vertical systems. The proposed research therefore aims at advancing the analysis and design methods of power networks for integrated systems while considering the particular traits and constraints relating to these systems. The results of the project will boost this emerging technology, bringing vertical integration a stride closer to economical high-volume manufacturing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have an explicit impact on design technologies for future multi-functional systems including primarily but not limited to electronic components. The immediate impact will be to augment analysis and design capabilities for the interested stakeholders. Within UK prominent corporations, such as ARM and Imagination technologies can exploit the outcomes of the project to ascertain the benefits of vertical integration for their future products. In addition, UK small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), such as Silvaco can benefit from the project. Silvaco is active in design automation and the investigated numerical algorithms and devised techniques, such as the monolithic vs partitioned approach in addressing multi-physics problems can be useful in those tasks that have high computational requirements. Maintaining the strong position of these established companies and leveraging the growth of SMEs within UK translates to a healthier economic environment for the British citizens. To further emphasize this point, consider that the new research framework Horizon 2020, recently launched by the European Union, includes a funding instrument exclusively for enhancing the development of SMEs and other provisions for economic growth through innovative research across Europe. Consequently, the proposed project is on the right track benefitting to the extend it can the electronics sector which currently contributes to 5.4% of the national GDP, employing about 850,000 across UK according to the report on Electronics Systems Challenges and Opportunities (ESCO). This report was composed by senior representatives of the British electronics industry and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.
The success of this project will guarantee the design of highly robust vertical systems paving the way for the establishment of 3-D integration as a mainstream technology in semiconductors industry. Consequently, the implicit societal impact of the project will be considerable as this technology presents unique opportunities for energy-efficient computing, multi-functionality, and miniaturized products. These products in turn will satisfy customer demands but also contribute to important aspects of our lives including well-being, health care, and wellness. The distinct feature that vertical systems have and which also drives this research effort is that these systems can potentially provide the means to meet these social objectives with a smaller energy overhead and manufacturing cost as compared to state-of-the-art technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>501273</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Design Automation Conference (university demo)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AA9F700-C5CC-44D3-A8E0-76DFC1AB6111</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A beta version of thermal simulator was presented at the University Booth of the Design Automation Conference in USA, the most prestigious conference in the electronic design automation community (EDA).

In the current version, it supports high-level block design of a 3-D Integrated Circuit (IC) for architecture exploration of next generation integrated systems. System architects can refer to the output of the MTA to refine their designs in order to meet thermal budgeting constraints. 

Future versions will support physical design verification checking for reliability issues at very fine granularity (e.g., device level) by passing detailed layout information to the MTA. 

To fully support future 3-D IC designs, the MTA natively supports the 3-D structure of ICs. It is different from previous work, which support the more standard process in thermal simulations of creating a 3-D IC from multiple planar ICs. MTA only requires the 3-D information of the circuit geometry to construct the basic computational mesh for the thermal simulation. The current version of the MTA represents a new, fully 3-D computational model for such ICs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>94472148-5C9C-41B6-A2D0-2B6FA13F26CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not available yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56defc99a12277.97547456</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Manchester thermal analyzer</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have implemented a flexible thermal simulator, which computes the temperature profile of an integrated circuit by solving the heat equation numerically with the finite element method. Differently from state-of-the-art tools, the implemented thermal simulator has the ability to compute adaptively refined solutions in both space and time, which is an advanced feature for such a thermal simulator. These adaptive features add to the efficiency of our simulator since we can compute more accurate temperature profiles with more efficiency (i.e., less computational cost). The existing thermal simulator makes use of state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative solvers for the solution of the linear systems arising in computations. The thermal simulator that we have developed so far allows the user to take the details of the integrated circuit floorplan and produce a fully adaptive, transient thermal analysis. The new thermal simulator makes use of the existing, open source finite element library OOMPH-Lib.

Part of the development of the thermal simulator has required adding new functionality to the OOMPH-Lib finite element library. Specifically, the ability to read in more complicated meshes which represents the geometry and thermal properties of the integrated circuit. The developed software is flexible and lays the foundation for the fully coupled, non-linear thermal simulator, where the thermal properties of the chip are coupled to the power distribution network.

Part of the work has resulted in new ways of generating the computational mesh of the 3-D IC. We are the first research team to introduce an automatic 3-D IC mesh generator by using an in-house framework and GMSH, a well-known open source mesh generation tool. The developed framework supports a hierarchical description of the IC design, which enables designers to simulate thermal profiles at different granularities. MTA uses an XML file for the hierarchical IC description. The reason is because XML is well-suited for storing the data of the hierarchical structure of the IC. We also provide designers with an additional tool to migrate their designs from different simulators to the MTA. Currently, it supports the well-known architecture-level thermal simulator, HotSpot, but will handle other tools in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E11B3F10-FE0D-4219-8B72-A604F0408F21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A few downloads of the tool.
