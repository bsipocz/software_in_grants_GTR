routemap for policy makers and practitioners.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M010546/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our coastline is under increasing pressure both in the UK and worldwide. These pressures are caused by human activities - as more and more of us want to live, retire and holiday by the seaside - and also by changing climate and sea-level-rise. Many coastal areas are already showing signs of the combined effects of these pressures. This was demonstrated during the intense and prolonged storms that affected large areas of England in winter 2013/14. Coastal communities experienced damage to mainline railways, destruction of seawalls, rapid cliff erosion and flooding that affected life, health, livelihoods and the economy. We urgently need to understand the risks to our coastline and determine how we can best adapt our coastline to make it safer for us to live in an increasingly stormy world. It is ever more clear that traditional approaches of defending our coastline do not always work, are expensive to maintain and often have negative ecological consequences. In many locations, we are shifting from an era of defending the coast to one where we learn to adapt to a changing coastline. A recent article in Science Magazine shows that scientists and environmental managers agree that understanding and managing how coastal communities and ecosystems will be affected by a changing climate is the third most important environmental management question we need to answer in the next decade. 

In the UK, there is general agreement and growing legislative requirements for society to adapt to a changing climate, including how we manage the coast to reduce the risks of flooding and storms. For example, in England, Shoreline Management Plans have strong policy recommendations for the future management of our coastline. In many areas, it is recommended that the current policy of 'hold the line' (aka. defend the coast) is replaced with 'managed realignment' or 'roll-back' where we need to change how we manage the coast. What is currently missing is a clear scientific and policy pathway that helps coastal managers and landowners identify the best methods of designing and funding coastal adaptation options to deliver 'managed realignment' locally. This project will seek to address this gap by: 

1. Reviewing, compiling and publishing best practice examples from global research about how to adapt ecosystems and communities to climate change at the coast. 
2. Reviewing recent scientific research on how essential ecosystem services for society (such as clean water and reduced flood risk) can be maintained and ideally improved as we change how we manage our coastline. 
3. Scientific evidence from 2 will be used as the basis for a Routemap to help coastal landowners and managers best develop practical strategies for adapting our coastline and coastal communities to a changing climate. The project will also identify the key funding mechanisms and policies that can be used to make coastal climate change adaptation projects happen in local communities. I will test the Routemap with a variety of key groups (including core partners and members of the engaged network) that will use the tool to help future-proof our coastal communities such as local councils and businesses that operate along the coast. This will make sure that we have designed a tool that meets their needs and uses local case studies from Cornwall, Suffolk and Scotland to show its capacity. I will measure how the new tool has helped change how people work and the guidance they give.
4. As the project will be linked to an internationally funded project on coastal climate change adaptation, I will draw on this expertise to inform what we do in the UK. I will also showcase the results of the UK analysis worldwide, demonstrating the UK's world leading expertise in this field. 

To achieve Objectives 1-4, I involve people beyond my core project partners - who are leading UK businesses, government agencies and climate change adaptation charities (Objective 5).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121997</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Concrete in the Classroom</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with several new organisations</gtr:description><gtr:id>B9BC04D7-1BB2-46B8-A6FE-23D6FA68DE8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaborative project has extended the KE fellowship and NERC GI innovation project work into primary and secondary school classrooms in Edinburgh and beyond into the central belt of Scotland.

This event was designed to help highlight some of the challenges and solutions for helping to enhance or maintain ecosystem services along highly urbanised coasts where hard infrastructure is used to support policy decisions to 'hold the line'. As part of the event we asked participants to complete a short survey to let us know about their prior knowledge of how concrete can be modified to improve ecological outcomes at the coast. Several expressed an interest in learning more about these ideas and/or were unaware of them prior to meeting with us on the day. We've been asked to follow-up with Scottish consultancies and local government teams around this topic as an outcome of this engagement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5b93d25bf93.25950045</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sniffer.org.uk/knowledge-hubs/resilient-catchments/flood-risk-management/flood-risk-management-conference-2017/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk at the Local Government Association's Coastal Special Interest Group (March 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2EB1488B-EDE6-4E67-A9B9-631BFC949EC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by the Head of the Coastal Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Local Government Association (LGA) to give them an update on my climate change adaptation fellowship work thus far as part of their bi-annual meetings at DEFRA in London.

There were over 50 participants from local government, businesses and the third sector along with key government bodies in Scotland (e.g. NHS, SEPA and SNH). Key inputs of mine to the event planning were two-fold: 1) To help design the workshop contents and breadth of invitees and 2) to design a questionnaire for participants to complete upon arrival, to help gauge their baseline understanding and professional experience of considering climate change adaptation. This will be followed up with participants at subsequent focus groups planned in 2017. Glasgow City Council staff are currently analysing these data.

Prior to my engagement with the Edinburgh Adapts team, a large number of engagement sessions with practitioners, policymakers, key stakeholders and the public had taken place. However, no coastal risks or adaptation needs were identified. Edinburgh is a coastal city along a substantive proportion of its boundary. My engagement led to two coastal actions being added to the plan which has been approved and is formally launched later in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E5330D5B-0271-4C2B-BDC9-D7D9A7D3E52B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>57fcfd14260180.15312519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Edinburgh Adapts - Shaping the content of the Action Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E12D255A-83D0-4091-B8E1-D0F2B7EEC00B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This impact is a change in the content of the Edinburgh Adapts Action Plan. In the spring of 2016 Adaptation Scotland arranged for me to liaise with the Edinburgh Adaptation team as part of my fellowship activities. This was near the end of an in-depth consultation with numerous stakeholders and the public across Edinburgh. At the time, there were no coastal actions included in the draft Edinburgh Adapts plan. Yet, much of the Northern and Eastern border of Edinburgh is the coast, much of which (e.g. Portobello) is at risk under at changing climate. I led on the discussions between University of Glasgow and the Edinburgh Adapts team, which led to us finessing two actions (BE18 and BE19) for inclusion in the final version of the Adaptation Plan which was published in December 2016. The impact arising from this activity is broadening of the topics (i.e. the coast) and geographic coverage of the Edinburgh Adapts Action Plan which improves the environmental sustainability of the document (as it includes a key area of the city region that was overlooked prior to our engagement). Further activities are planned to help raise awareness of coastal climate change risks for Edinburgh to help deliver against our actions in the plan.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5c871edf133.20875386</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy
