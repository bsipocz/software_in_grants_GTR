A very good example of this is how Scottish tartan was revitalised in the 19th century by the allocation of clan names to particular colour and pattern sequences. Tartan continues to make re-appearances in the fashion market through designers such as Vivien Westwood and Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana. Another example of cultural revitalisation is how, in the 1950s, the basic twelve bar form of blues music was transformed into rock and roll and thence into rock music. This traditional form of music is continuously revisited and revitalised.

The researchers have been involved in a number of revitalising projects such as: at Leeds Cassidy has worked on a PhD project which examined traditional Korean Bojagi fabrics, used as wrapping materials, and experimented successfully with these to form fashion fabrics; at Lancaster Walker and Evans are working on two PhD projects exploring the role of design in the revitalisation of traditional crafts in Northern Thailand and Turkey.

The authors of this proposal wish to undertake a major study to examine both existing and new case studies and to provide a model to enable future designers to use traditional cultural products, patterns and processes as new, contemporary products, patterns and processes. Apart from journal papers the outcomes will include a book consisting of case studies and an explanation and discussion of the proposed model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will be researchers, practitioners, and educators within the design community and producers, suppliers and consumers of culturally relevant designs, products and practices. The following strategies will be used to achieve impacts of the research beyond academia:

- Early engagement of project aims with appropriate stakeholders such as The Crafts Council, Royal Society of Arts (RSA), etc.
- Consultation with design practitioners though networks such as the Design Council, the Design Business Association (DBA), etc
- Dissemination of in progress and final research outputs through a curated public exhibition at the Peter Scott Gallery, Lancaster, UK
- Publication of a book summarising the research undertaken within the project.

The impact upon the beneficiaries of the research is thus: design practitioners will be provided with a framework which will allow them to effectively explore culturally relevant designs, products and practices, and how in turn these might be revitalized using contemporary technologies, processes and communication strategies; consumers will be provided with fresh and exciting designs, products and awareness of processes of cultural relevance; commerce and industry will benefit from the development of commercially sustainable modes of engagement with culturally relevant designs, products and practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>607878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - 31st World Cultural Council Award Ceremony &amp; Aalto University Academic Summit, Finland: Creativity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7564C040-7104-4502-9C0B-9A543ED2041D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote: Creativity - the imperative of solitude, 31st World Cultural Council Award Ceremony &amp;amp; Aalto University Academic Summit, November 18, 2014, Helsinki, Finland.

Participants were encouraged to select culturally significant design, product and practice that was meaningful to them (often drawn from their own culture) and use this as a mechanism to explore the veracity of the revitalisation strategies. Hosted at the University of Helsinki, 17 undergraduate craft education students plus 3 staff members comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of the eight revitalisation clusters. Participants applied these strategies to an example of a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with. Positive feedback was received from participants with results demonstrating how the strategies could be employed to generate novel outcomes that hitherto may not have been considered. Key insights identified the need to refine and simplify strategy descriptions and to provide a breadth of examples to best convey the possibilities of the revitalisation strategies.

The workshop comprised 1) an overview of the Design Routes project including its aims and work to date, 2) group engagement with revitalisation strategies through worksheets and examples of strategies, and 3) a discussion and feedback session. Participants were encouraged to select culturally significant design, product and practice that was meaningful to them (often drawn from their own culture) and use this as a mechanism to explore the veracity of the revitalisation strategies. The workshop in Estonia was hosted by the Estonian Native Crafts Department in the Viljandi Culture Academy at the University of Tartu. 18 students studying Estonian native crafts plus 4 member of staff comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of each revitalisation cluster. Taking a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with, each group considered how they could use these strategies for revitalisation. Key insights included the value that the structure of the taxonomy of revitalisation clusters and strategies provided to the ongoing work of the Viljandi Culture Academy with participants, including staff, noting how this aligned with their approaches, and the potential to use these strategies to revisit many native Estonian crafts. Valuable feedback was gained from the participants across the workshops that helped to i) understand how to effectively articulate the overall concept of revitalisation, ii) refine how individual strategies were described, and iii) how best to collectively communicate these strategies as a prospective tool for revitalisation.

This talk was one of the engagement events that accompanied the DESIGN FOR LIFE exhibition at Brantwood.
At this event, food was served that had been designed by children at the local school after visiting and based on what they had seen at the DESIGN FOR LIFE Exhibition. The food was prepared by the Brantwood Chef.
The talk generated much discussion and a lively debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a4a90d73d637.88020005</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.designforlife.website/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - Tokyo University of the Arts, Japan: Design for Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADE76B7A-DE07-4E9B-9CFE-DD144E98783A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote Talk: Design for Sustainability, Technical University of the Arts, Tokyo, Japan 26 Oct 2016

The event enabled the researchers to discuss their research with the general public on a one-to-one basis. The exhibition received excellent feedback from visitors, with comments referring to 'an array of fantastic and diverse subject areas' and praising 'the ability to speak to researchers during an exhibition and to discuss your own ideas.' The feedback also captured the project's impact, with many visitors suggesting that they intended to further explore some of the diverse topics highlighted in the exhibition, including the traditional craft of smocking, which was used to represent the Design Routes research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d97397615074.05236818</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://publicengagementleeds.wordpress.com/curious-encounters-with-objects-past-present-future/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - Anadolu University, Turkey: Practice-based Design Research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13287E36-0A1C-4146-AE74-EFFA72960320</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote Talk: Practice-based Design Research for Sustainability, Faculty of Design, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, 21 April 2016.
