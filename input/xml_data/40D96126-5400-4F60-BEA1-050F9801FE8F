Households in these contexts resort to informal tools, such as gifts and inter-personal transfers, to share idiosyncratic risk. Such informal risk sharing occurs within social networks, with family networks, particularly, forming a ?natural? risk sharing institution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research aims to deepen our understanding of risk sharing in family networks, focusing explicitly on the role of network structure (representation of who is related to who). This is likely important because many informal tools employed for risk sharing rely on bilateral relationships. Therefore, who one is linked with and who their links are further linked with will shape both how risk is shared and the amount shared.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Specifically, this research will use unique data from Mexico with information on family ties and socio-economic variables to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>provide empirical evidence on the importance of network structure for risk sharing&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>investigate empirically predictions from theory that networks of higher value provide better insurance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>investigate whether altruism, or mutual caring, in family networks allows for more risk sharing when risk sharing arrangements need to be self-sustainable. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this research will be of interest to both academic and non-academic audiences. On the academic side, it will be of interest to researchers in a number of disciplines, including those studying risk sharing and insurance, the role of networks and social protection issues in low and middle income countries in particular. This will include primarily academics working in the fields of economics, public policy and sociology. The non-academic beneficiaries of this research will be policymakers in low and middle income countries, International Financial Institutions and NGOs and insurance companies working on developing micro-insurance products for the poor.
On the academic front, this research will generate benefits by providing evidence on the importance of explicitly considering network structure (an exact representation of who is related/connected to who) in characterising informal risk sharing in developing countries. A small recent theoretical literature suggests that this is likely an important determinant of whether and the amount of risk sharing that can be supported in a network. Yet, almost no empirical evidence exists on this, due to a scarcity of suitable data. This research overcomes this using a rich data source from Mexico. Further, it will provide evidence of the importance of network value in shaping informal risk sharing, with a key innovation being to approximate the value of a network from available information on wealth. The research will also broaden understanding of risk sharing by developing a theoretical model, which differs from existing models by allowing for altruism between links, and testing its predictions empirically. More generally, it will provide evidence on the importance of considering network structure in understanding the role of social networks in developing countries. Though the latter has been investigated by recent research, very few studies, particularly empirical studies in economics consider the former, though this has been shown to be important in fields such as sociology. Finally, it will make methodological contributions to the empirics of networks in economics, currently a small but growing research area.
On the non-academic side, the results of this research will have important implications for the design of development policies, including social insurance policies, and for the creation of insurance products for the poor (also called micro-insurance). There is a lot of interest and on-going debate among policymakers in low and middle income countries regarding the introduction and expansion of social insurance services. There has also been much interest in providing micro-insurance from insurance companies, policymakers and NGOs, and designs are currently being piloted in a number of countries around the world, with poor take-up of these proving to be a challenge. Careful design of these policies and products is important in determining take-up and also in improving welfare. Better knowledge of existing arrangements and the role of network structure in particular, can help with this and also provide information on the likely demand for such services. 
To maximise impacts, I will disseminate results of the research through:
1. Academic Seminars and conferences, such as the Latin American and Carribean Economic Association meetings, and seminars at UCL and IFS and other institutions in Latin America.
2. Academic papers to be submitted for publication in top peer-reviewed journals, and to the IFS working paper series. 
3. Non-technical summaries will be published in the form of IFS Briefing Notes and IFS observations. These are freely available from the IFS webpage. Short summaries will also be submitted for publication on the Vox Lacea blog.
4. Organisation of a non-technical workshop at the IFS, inviting stakeholders from institutions including DFID, representatives from NGOs such as Oxfam among others.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>176100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Economic Society Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B2331446-D32E-43DF-AAF2-AA3CBB0F22A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked discussions with members of the audience, who suggested other fruitful avenues to consider.

Study findings were presented at seminars and conferences to ensure academic integrity of the analysis and interpretation of results and one of the papers has been submitted to (and for which a revision has been requested) academic journals. Though many findings from the studies are more interesting for academic audiences, two key policy-relevant findings have emerged: First, the paper on Malawi showed that extended families may not always succeed in protecting household well-being, indicating a need to strengthen social safety nets through policy intervention in this context. Second, the papers relating to Mexico indicate that risk sharing is better in extended family networks that provide more opportunities for risk sharing. Thus policy interventions that increase the opportunities for risk sharing provided by such networks could improve informal insurance. These findings have, in parallel, been disseminated to wider audiences through policy briefs and newsletters aimed at non-academic audiences including the general public, as well as presentations at conferences attended by policymakers (including the Chief Economist of DFID, Stefan Dercon) and journalists. These dissemination activities are on-going: one paper from this grant will be presented at the leading economics conference in Latin America (the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association annual conference to be held in Colombia this year), which will be attended by policymakers in the region as well as local journalists and academics. This will raise the profile of the study findings within the region.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0AA8E72D-44BD-44D4-A50E-6219F1EEECCA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deabe62375f6.72542297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded under this grant aims to improve our understanding of the features of extended family networks - and particularly of the architecture of these networks - shapes the extent to which they can help households in low income countries cope with the multitudes of risk they face. It does so by empirically analysing hypotheses grounded in economic theory, using data from rural Mexico and Malawi. Three research questions were addressed within this grant: (1) How do socially close connections (i.e. parents, siblings and children of the head and spouse residing outside the household) and socially distant connections (i.e. the family of one's siblings' spouses; as well as uncles, aunts, cousins) affect how well a household's consumption is protected against idiosyncratic fluctuations in its income?; (2) How does the extent of risk sharing in response to idiosyncratic crop losses vary with the number of a household's connections?; and (3) To what extent does the quality of a connection matter in its effectiveness in providing risk sharing?

The findings are as follows:
(1) Socially distant connections provide more opportunities for risk sharing in rural Mexico, and this is more important for risk sharing than the additional trust and enforcement provided by socially close connections. (2) In rural Malawi, households with more risk sharing connections (specifically, brothers of the wife who norms indicate should play an important role in ensuring the wellbeing of their sisters' families) achieve worse risk sharing, which is consistent with models where households getting a good shock benefit more from walking away from a risk sharing arrangement with a group of other households, when they are part of a larger group of households. (3) The quantity and quality of connections, where the latter is measured according to a household's wealth; both matter for how well protected a household's consumption is to fluctuations in its income.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Results from this research indicate that: (1) Policies and interventions that influence risk sharing opportunities might also indirectly affect the effective functioning of social network based insurance. However, the magnitude of any such effect is unclear, and worth further investigation. (2) The findings from the Malawi study indicate that extended family based insurance need not function well, suggesting a role for government policy. The research also raises some important questions for future academic research: (1) The within-village extended family network is a small part of the entire extended family network. How do risk sharing considerations, and other economic incentives influence who remains in the village, and who leaves? What effect do they have on migration and marriage choices? (2) This research has focused on the response of consumption to income fluctuations of crop losses. However, households might choose to keep consumption stable by cutting back on investments, such as putting off purchasing farm equipment or inputs such as fertiliser; or withdrawing children from school. A natural question is then how do network features affect these investment choices?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>669EDAE4-61D4-4010-9A14-4F93898A4E52</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56785066afa640.73138083</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A research assistant and I developed and programmed an efficient algorithm to identify family connections between households based on surname combinations and age restrictions.
