&lt;p>The North American group have focused on the making of publics in early modern history; while the UK group has addressed contemporary practices of public making. However, the two groups share some significant questions, analytical approaches and methods. We aim to bring members of the two groups together in conversation to explore these differences and similarities in question, method and analysis. We are interested to assess:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the significance of historical period&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the effects of the social, political and cultural contexts of possibilities and practices of public making&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consider how the methodological and analytical orientations might be developed further. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>There is a very strong commitment to seeing this network as a means of developing future scholarship and future scholars, darwing on existing practices in the two groups towards the development of early career researchers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What can we learn from these different 'publics'? What can they tell us about the way publics are formed and how public interests rise and fall?&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We think it is important to distinguish between immediate and potential impacts of this proposal, given that it is a proposal to establish a network with a view to developing future collaborations.

The immediate impacts are likely to be:

1. the enlargement of a space of intellectual inquiry that has high salience in contemporary social and political life: the identification, engagement and mobilization of publics. This concern is a recurrent one, linking a variety of fields of social endeavour: from artistic practice to the governance of public services, or from the impact of academic work to the participation of communities in self-development. This makes this intellectual focus a significant point of interest.

2. the overcoming of some some intellectual and organizational boundaries (of time, space and discipline) that currently inhibit the development of a more coherent and integrated approach to the topic.

3. the development of an international network through which early career reserachers may be supported in the development of this issue.

4. the exchange and development of initiatives that involve forms of making public knowledge and constructing public engagement around the academy.

The longer term impacts are likely to be:

1. the development of research, knowledge and analysis associated with practices of public making that will have policy and practice implications beyond the academy.

2. the enrolment of audiences and collaborators interested in the theory and practice of public making in heterogeneous contexts.

3. the creation of spaces and resources for critical reflections on the conditions, possibilities, media, limitations and failures of public making practices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>McGill University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for the Public Life of Arts and Ideas (IPLAI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Making Publics</gtr:description><gtr:id>2659A201-1D78-49BA-997A-A53965AE209A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop for early career scholars around issues of Making Publics (held summer 2014).

The aim was to create a stimulating yet supportive environment to develop research interests, questions and material. The event was thought to be very successful in these respects.

The workshop led to the creation of a network of early career scholars which then became the organisers for a series of three further seminar/workshop events in the UK (hosted at the LSE, University of Kent and University of East Anglia).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55b7b0db85a762.81748962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://publicsnetwork.wordpress.com/about/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has no findings as such, since the grant was to sponsor a collaboration.
The collaboration has been productive in three key respects:
(1) it energised a network of early career scholars (2013-2014); and took UK early career scholars to North America and brought North American early career scholars to the UK.
(2) it fed into new collaborations (e.g., with IPLAI in Montreal) around public engagement questions;
(3) it linked to emerging work on policy and practice (around the Participation Now project at the OU, involving Mahony and Stephansen))
(4) it fed into conference panels (e.g., Crossroads in Cultural Studies, 2014) and planned publications around issues of public making.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CD8BBAC3-EE01-4AB1-9D3F-C408D2AC0E1C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55b89c953f35e2.46085386</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The funding was to support an exploratory collaboration between researchers from the Publics Research Group at the Open University, UK and scholars involved in the Making Publics Programme in Canada and the USA.
The aim was to explore theoretical and methodological overlaps between the two programmes, and consider the implications of differences in time and space between the two.
The project was organised around a series of workshops and seminars (two in North America and one in the UK) which would bring together both established scholars and early career researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The common concerns of this collaboration have been developed in several ways:
(1) in the practices of IPLAI at McGill University (http://iplai.ca/);
(2) in the work of the Participation Now project at the Open University (http://www.open.edu/openlearn/society/politics-policy-people/participation-now)
(3) in planned articles about public making practices; and the analytical implications of comparison across time and space.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99C3FC6C-A821-463D-A210-A6E820179A21</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55b89f31721b40.25893391</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDBDB500-A2D8-45AC-A678-83FEB3157B9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The work of public engagement</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communicazioni Sociali</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd60b7937532813d1db0173325cf2c56"><gtr:id>bd60b7937532813d1db0173325cf2c56</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mahony, N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55b7a8ec217a98.20439929</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C6330E9D-F7CD-49A3-BBC7-4A2FBCA42B46</gtr:id><gtr:title>Public crises, public futures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cultural Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/239b94ebb4b125e98c53f6db122bed43"><gtr:id>239b94ebb4b125e98c53f6db122bed43</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mahony N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>55b61cbfddcaa1.93517821</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J019771/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB55E3F-FFEA-4BE8-9850-37FB373F4D31</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
