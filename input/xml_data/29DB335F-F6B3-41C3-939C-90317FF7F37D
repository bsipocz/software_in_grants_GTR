multi-UAVs</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J012564/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In March 2011, Japan suffered from its biggest earthquake and devastating tsunami. Severe damage were inflicted on its Fukushima nuclear plants and more than 100,000 people had to be evacuated after the radiation levels became unsafe. Workers were not able to operate on site, preventing them from securing safety at the atomic power plant and averting a major radiation leak. One month after the disaster, in order to assess the severity of the damage to the nuclear plant from above, a small aerial vehicle equipped with cameras was sent to take pictures and videos of the affected areas. The video footage obtained brought valuable information to the rescue teams that could not have been acquired otherwise. But the use of aerial vehicles still remains limited by the fact that they require a remote operator at transmission range to control them. It is also necessary to have an operator to control the camera and interpret the data.

In order to work autonomously, these systems need to be highly intelligent and rational so that they can become reliable: they must have high levels of knowledge to accomplish their AI-complex missions which occur in any other information environment. This implies that they should adapt to any unexpected situations such as recent changes not reflected in prior information on the environment and possible loss of GPS due to obstructing buildings or indoor exploration; reliable operation under such conditions would, for instance, enable them to return safely to their base station. In a multi-UAV setting, they should additionally be able to communicate with each other to simplify their goals, to learn from each other's information, and to update and share their knowledge. Given that any mission is unique in terms of deployment areas, tasks and goals to be achieved, etc., and can be critical in the sense that human lives may be involved, the implementation must be verified to be correct with respect to a formal specification. A famous example of an implementation error and a failure to comply with the specification is the self-destruction of Ariane 5 in 1996 immediately after take-off, caused by a numeric overflow due to an implementation that was not suitable for all possible situations. In 1996, the Lockheed Martin/Boeing Darkstar long-endurance UAV crashed following what the Pentagon called a &amp;quot;mishap [..] directly traceable to deficiencies in the modelling and simulation of the flight vehicle&amp;quot;.

To achieve the reliability required, we will need to develop a formalism that represents the sets of actions each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can perform while allowing capture of the kinetic constraints of the UAVs. We will then verify that the behaviours of each UAV modelled using this formalism lead to the individual or overall goal of the mission they are to achieve. These need to be extended from individual behaviours to a cooperative level amongst the multiple UAVs. Next, we plan to link the low-level code to high-level abstraction and verify it via advanced model-checking techniques. Finally, logical tools will be used to exhaustively reason about learning as a result of information flow among UAVs and their environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used for civil and science purpose such as natural disasters, humanitarian relief, environment, weather and storm tracking. The most important reason for use of UAVs is the avoidance of risk to human health. A prime example is the recent catastrophe in Fukushima, Japan, where a UAV was imported from the US to record videos and take pictures of the damaged nuclear plant. To date, widespread use of UAVs is still limited by one major challenge: safety and reliability. Consequently they cannot be used autonomously, which severely constrains their potential. With autonomous capabilities, teams of UAVs could be deployed with minimum human intervention. These UAVs could collaborate to achieve a given task, whilst being more reactive to environmental hazards than under the control of human operators. Such teams of UAVs would ultimately achieve better results and be more cost-effective than UAVs acting in isolation under the control of human operators. Large teams of UAVs could be easily mobilized and deployed in international missions as emergency response teams.

Our research will address this lack of reliability and safety via a cross-cutting framework that will range from engineering details to verification and logic and reasoning of UAVs. We will demonstrate the efficiency and validity of our approach by implementations on real quadrotor UAVs, in scenarios where they are likely to be used: search and rescue. The outcomes of our research will apply not only to UAVs but to any autonomous systems (cars, planes, or underwater vehicles). There is a very broad range of direct beneficiaries of our research in all sectors of society. The immediate beneficiaries are academic researchers and manufacturers of autonomous systems and the users of these systems. Medium-term beneficiaries are non-technical users that would benefit from off-the-shelves cost-effective verified systems. In the long term, we expect that the outcomes of this research will become the standard framework used by manufacturers of autonomous systems to provide users verified safe and reliable platforms.

UAVs can be used in a great range of applications that span from remote sensing, to surveillance, wildfire detection and management, law enforcement, pollution monitoring, TV broadcast relay, etc. The global unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) market, worth an estimated US $7.1 billion this year, is expected to grow by 4% over the next ten years, reaching US $10.5 billion in 2021, according to a Lucintel report. The growing interest in UAVs combined with a low market penetration rate makes the timing of this project ideal to have a real impact in contributing towards the development and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles.

We anticipate an uptake of our results to yield new investments in verification technology and industrialization of the processes that we develop. Where current state of the art involves outsourcing testing to low-wage countries we expect a shift towards automation and development of such automation tools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>636717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Techcity insider - Audio podcast</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C67C0296-05F1-4126-990B-82F0ACA96B14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Podcast produced with TechCity: &amp;quot;TECH TALK 31: Swarm robotics - inspired by the biological studies of insect and bird colonies - sees large numbers of single robots deployed together to produce a collective behaviour to solve problems.

The goal and unique contribution of this ambitious project is to cross-cut this entire infrastructure, ranging from high-level behavioural specifications, to embedded software, and even to low level details of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

We have developed new logics to reason about learning as a result of, e.g., concurrent navigation and communication, and formally verified their implementations in the embedded control software by means of automated program analysis, and validated our implementations on a multi-UAV platform.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project will yield numerous artefacts of value to other groups, including a coherent package of a logic describing high-level rules, a corresponding decision procedure, a verification tool that links such rules to an implementation, and a prototype UAV team that runs such an implementation, together with elaborate models of low-level aspects of the UAV platform. At the end of the project, in order to facilitate exploitation and experimentation by other researchers, we will release our data and tool set under open-source, research-friendly licenses to ensure the widest possible dissemination. If appropriate, Oxford University may release some of our verification software under other licenses that allow commercial exploitation.

As part of this work, a major infrastructure for automated analysis of software packages has been established. It enables us to analyse more than 22,000 source packages of a Linux distribution, containing more than 400 million lines of C code, in a timely fashion. Among the results are more than 700 public bug reports, of which
