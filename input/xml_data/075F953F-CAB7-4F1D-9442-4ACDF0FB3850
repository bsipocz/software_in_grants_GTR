However, this enthusiasm is marred by widespread recognition that young males may be significantly under-represented and a strong case can be made for addressing the gender imbalance in singing. Additional effort at boys' inclusion is justified not only to ensure future availability of adult male singers but at least equally by the demonstrable social and educational benefits of engaging more boys in an activity that will promote their well-being. Evidence indicates a further imbalance in social class and need to widen participation. A clear relationship has been demonstrated between educational opportunity and the misperception that the youthful, high voice is 'weird' or 'unnatural'. Confusing messages are also given to young boys by popular TV shows. The research shows a particular need to educate junior choir leaders, including primary teachers, about the capability of the young male voice, to provide enhanced opportunity to exploit it and above all, to provide younger boys with appropriate role models of singing by older boys and young men.\n\nThe key aims; \n\nDevelop a supportive infrastructure through which any boy, regardless of social background or circumstance, can be enabled to progress in choral singing\n\nProvide clear role models of singing as an enriching activity for boys that counter negative stereotypes\n\nEducate those who work with junior age children about the young male voice and the difficulties faced by boys who enjoy singing\n\nFurther enhance understanding of the 'missing males' syndrome in singing by knowledge exchange between expert researchers and practitioners\n\nThe National Youth Choir of Great Britain has the potential to realise the aims detailed above through the intermediary role of two large university faculties engaged in children's workforce development. The NYC maintains a Northern and Southern choir for ten to fourteen year olds to nurture voices until they reach an appropriate standard for the National Youth Training Choir. The Northern choir would be linked to the lead institution, Edgehill University, and the Southern choir to the University of the West of England. These can provide a venue and focus of activity for networks of junior choirs. Advanced technical development for the project will be provided the University of York. Each region would address the question of how the previous research results can be used to create networks and events that nurture boys' singing through role models. It is possible to draw on a successful pilot scheme already developed by the principal applicant through the Choir Schools Association. This indicates that key roles for the NYC are:\n\nTo provide advice on eclectic, high quality repertoire to nurture junior voices to audition standard\n\nTo provide boy singers as role models through an interactive e-book \n\nTo provide young male leaders to refine performance at regional events\n\nThe key roles for the HEIs are:\n\nTo maintain networks of junior choirs committed to the project\n\nCreate two key resources to be used and support teachers in their use (an e-book on the young male voice and supporting web pages, using boys from the NYC)\n\nFacilitate and host regional events\n\nA detailed evaluation of every stage of the project that will provide significant new research data of high value to choral practitioners will be a key function of the lead HEI. This structure dictates a two year life cycle for the project. Year one: identification of the repertoire and recording of this during NYC courses (held twice a year); production of the e-book and demonstration material. Year two: regional meetings of leaders for training/distribution of the e-book; use of the materials in junior choirs; regional singing days and concerts to celebrate and showcase success.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186313</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film featuring vocal coach Jenevora Williams and boys from the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain</gtr:description><gtr:id>76FD90F1-7B9D-4F32-8535-5D7D6A333196</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved understanding of vocal health amongst young male singers</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-6746165237.153103a7135b20</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Vocal Health</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.martin-ashley.com/student-pages/survival</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Series of sound recordings demonstrating the cambiata voice.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8093D0AC-1EF1-4E9F-82EB-4923A6E1F50E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The cambiata singing method is being adopted across the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54609a991060c2.40752187</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>NCYGB and ABCD Cambiata Choirs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.martin-ashley.com/sound-archive/boys-keep-singing</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film featuring Professor David Howard and boys from the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain</gtr:description><gtr:id>A36CFB7F-C2D7-4A0D-9E23-FC4B25165BEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved understanding of voice production by secondary school music teachers and choir directors working with 11 - 1r4 age group</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8350694457.395649a7134590</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Vocal Science</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.boys-keep-singing.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film featuring Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral Choir in which the impact of singing in a large, resonant space is demonstrated.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A118AB8-A735-49D4-A573-99B7FE97645F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased understanding of performance venue.

The Music Plan requires the setting up of music &amp;quot;hubs&amp;quot; that are required to develop a singing strategy. Music hubs have been using the research to develop their singing strategies through recognition of the extent to which they need to engage boys. The National Singing Programme (&amp;quot;SingUp&amp;quot;) has used the research to inform a ne programme &amp;quot;Sing Up Secondary&amp;quot;. Secondary schools have used the research to develop new singing activities for boys, including outreach to primary schools and the development of continuity across primary/secondary transition. Ability to track the project website shows the materials being used in over 500 secondary schools, mainly in the UK but also globally including Australia and Kenya. The Association of British Choral Directors is using the research findings to establish networks of teachers and conductors across its UK regions. Oxford University press has commissioned a new &amp;quot;cambiata choral series&amp;quot; based directly on the research. This has resulted in composing and arranging commissions for individuals working in the creative industries.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2006</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7ECF04BA-1BF7-47FC-A80A-A3B9582F9E09</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545c876203ab12.27778556</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project investigated the understandings of adolescent voice change held by teachers and by school pupils. In particular it sought to establish patterns of success and failure associated with the retention of boys in choral singing between the ages of 11 and 14, a time when it is well known from previous research that large numbers of young males are lost to this activity. Five key success factors were identified for choral settings and presented in a series of filmed outputs based on the peer2peer education principle: 



1. A real commitment to boys' participation in the arts, supported by the senior leadership team



2. A willingness to organise the timetable to avoid wherever possible a clash between singing and sport



3. A willingness to experiment with opportunities for boys to explore voices without the presence of girls, such as setting music classes by gender or the provision of parallel, single sex extra-curricular activities.



4. Knowledge of and the ability to apply key research findings on the changes that happen to boys' voices between the ages of ten and fifteen.



5. A willingness to celebrate the achievements of boys who sing, for example through performing to primary school children as ambassadors for the school. 



Of these five points, it was found that for the teachers it was new subject knowledge and improved understanding of voice development in boys that motivated changes in practice. For the boys, it was the freedom to discover their voices in a situation where they were protected from girls' comments and judgements. Boys were found to be significantly more sensitive to this issue than commonly recognised and the research demonstrated that boys quickly and readily changed their attitudes when moved to a single sex setting.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research can be used wherever there is a desire to engage boys in singing, particularly between the ages of eleven and fourteen. This would include schools, both within and without the normal curriculum. It would include any community music activity, for example, youth choirs, church choirs, informal singing groups etc. It has some relevance to other situations where it is desired to broaden boys' outlooks and engage them in cultural and artistic activities. It has a significant degree of relevance in educational and youth work settings that address such issues as homophobic bullying or gender equality.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F3C8CD34-DCA3-469D-9FF8-1F2AAA303022</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5846667798.093217761e164</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.martin-ashley.com/boys-keep-singing</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Digital audio recordings of &amp;gt;1000 adolescent boys' voices, analysed for speaking fundamental frequency and, in the case of singers, singing range.</gtr:description><gtr:id>320A9A73-9089-4FFF-B24A-358369B201B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of a smartphone app that assess the pubertal status of a boy through analysis of the pitch of his speaking voice and comparison of the result with the database.
