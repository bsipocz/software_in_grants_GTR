Roughly speaking, this concept of self-organised criticality means that a system evolves towards critical states that, when nudged, topple and cause avalanches of all distances and time scales to happen throughout.

The prototypical sandpile model is on the planar grid but the preferred mathematical setting is on a graph. At the heart of this model are its toppling dynamics: if a sandpile grows too high then the pile topples and does so by donating grains of sand to its neighbouring piles. These neighbouring piles may themselves topple, and the process continues until the system reaches some stable state.

Although it has been shown to be a poor model for modelling general sandpiles, it has been shown to be a good model for many other and more important things. Examples are plentiful and include forest fires, social media, and even dose response analysis in toxicology. The model also explains the cascading effects that have been observed in these systems. Many rich results emerged when mathematicians began to study the sandpile model on abstract graphs and these studies have also provided links to many other parts of mathematics.

Very recently, the author conducted an in-depth study of the sandpile model on the complete bipartite graph, unearthing new and surprising results. One such result is that recurrent states (similar to critical states) can be uniquely represented as staircase polyominoes, geometric objects that are like dominoes with many cells but which are enclosed between two staircase shapes. This observation led to a new link between polynomials defined on these polyominoes and the subject of diagonal harmonic polynomials in algebraic combinatorics, one of the more fertile hunting grounds for algebraic combinatorialists in the last decade.

Our proposal is to follow the success of this by applying the analysis to more general classes of graphs that are regular or recursive in some way. The purpose is to perform a classification of recurrent states of the sandpile model on these graphs and determine what other combinatorial objects they are linked to. Further to this we will turn the initial work on its head to build a new tool in bijective combinatorics that will relate tilings of general lattices to recurrent states of the sandpile model. This will provide new insights into the theory of lattice tilings, and also unsolved problems in this broad area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is fundamental research in graph theory and enumerative combinatorics and
its immediate impact will therefore be on both these communities.

The topic at the heart of this proposal has been shown to be a good model of various real-world systems and our research will therefore have an impact on these applications. The way in which it will have an impact is a body of results that classify the behaviour of sandpile systems whose underlying graph structure possesses some type of recursive or regular pattern.

The sandpile model has been advocated by scientists to be be a good way to model certain types of brain behaviour (Scientific American, April 2014), and this idea has been receiving a lot of attention lately. Three dimensional molecular grids whose vertices are connected to nearest-neighbours in a regular way are an example of what we would consider a recursive structure, and so there is a clear and definite impact that our work has on theoretical models of brain activity.

As we have made clear in the Pathways to Impact statement, we plan to provide societal and economic impact by popularising the easier-to-access part of our work using social media and blogs, particularly those related to national mathematics competitions and recreational mathematics.

Final year projects of computer science students in the university will be used to showcase instances of our work. These projects are presented to industrial visitors on project demonstration day and this will provide both educational impact and industrial impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>283425</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Connections of the abelian sandpile model to certain objects, called permutation tableaux, which in turn are intimately linked to another physics model, namely the (Partially) Asymmetric Exclusion Process.
