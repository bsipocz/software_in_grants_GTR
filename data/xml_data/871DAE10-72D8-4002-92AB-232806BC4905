Consequently, there has been a focus in both academic and activist work on contesting homophobia. Such a project has an urgency that must not be denied given that the buggery laws remain widely intact and every day stories of harassment, violence and fear are reported. Indeed, Faith Smith asserts that 'the taboo of homosexuality would seem to define the present moment in the region' in her 2011 collection of essays Sex and the Citizen (2011b: 6). However, it is my perception that unless there is a more thoroughgoing challenge to what is knowable and livable in terms of sexual lives then decriminalizing homosexuality and extending sexual citizenship to LGBT peoples will not be sufficiently transformative. 

As a literary critic what strikes me is how a whole range of Caribbean writers repeatedly represent queer possibilities and suggest a much more flexible understanding of what is sexually and amorously available for description. In the face of continual assumptions about the impossibility of non-heteronormative lives, my project highlights stories of sexual relations, encounters and behaviours that do not necessarily correspond to the dominant framework of 'gay liberation' but that nevertheless collectively assert the realities of queer Caribbean lives. My monograph, Caribbean Queer: Desire, dissidence and literary constructions of Caribbean subjectivity, will make an original intervention in the field of Caribbean sexuality studies by contesting heteronormativity, rather than contesting homophobia. 

Because the persuasiveness of my argument lies in revealing the persistent literary disruption of sexual normativities, my book examines early works alongside contemporary ones, works that have been critically acclaimed alongside those that have received almost no attention; works by so-called LGBT writers and so-called straight writers; works that clearly articulate a guiding preoccupation with questions of sexual identification and those in which the words gay, homosexual or queer are never mentioned but which nevertheless represent the social density of Caribbean queer lives. What emerges from reading all these different works alongside each other is their collective capacity to undo the sufficiency of our inherited but invented categories of sexual description, mainly queering heterosexuality but also perhaps asking us to pause before we invest further in homosexuality and a schema of stable binaries. This work will help to shape more creative thinking among new and early career researchers as it empowers them to think in much more expansive and pliant ways. Taking these observations into conversation with other researchers in the UK and the Anglophone Caribbean, as well as with groups advocating for LGBT rights, will enable a fruitful and challenging dialogue to emerge in which the question of traditions and translations of cultural meaning will need to be addressed very directly. Public engagement with these issues is also vital and the project will use literature as a tool for opening up questions of sexual categorisation and understanding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The fact that Caribbean sexualities is a subject of heated exchange among the media, political arenas, healthcare providers and the church, as well as the general public, means that the potential non-academic beneficiaries of this fellowship are remarkably diverse and likely to be significant in numbers. 

One of the central objectives of the fellowship is to communicate the world of diverse and unruly sexual identities and imaginings as it is described in Caribbean literary works within a more general conversation about how people have been defined historically and how these definitions and understandings may need to be revised in order to give due weight and affirmation to non-heteronormative people and communities who have been excluded and stigmatized. The public-facing elements of this conversation will generate public engagement with academic research as well as with a heated and urgent societal issue. The panel discussions allow for very direct engagement and conversation between different stakeholders that will be filmed for open access via the International Resource Network. The literary readings exploit the empathetic capacity that literature evokes as a tool for bridging difference and opening up new possibilities for representing and receiving ideas around sexuality. In this way, the project contributes to the cultural enrichment of all its participants.

My work during this fellowship aims to contest narrow and exclusionary ideas of Caribbean sexual normativities and to foster visibility of a diversity of voices and perspectives on this issue. In this way it aims to create the conditions for a more equal, just and positive social fabric in the Caribbean and the diaspora and therefore is beneficial to the health and culture of these locations. The collective and collaborative aspects of the fellowship aim to foster a transformative understanding of sexual diversity that makes exclusion seem unwarranted and therefore have the potential to improve social cohesion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80338</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The wall mural was the closing event of the Sexualities in the Tent workshop and was an entirely unscripted act of artistic co-production.

The results of hearing Lawrence Scott and Bernadine Evaristo read was to inspire a lot of the audience to think about the impact that creative writing can have in shifting social perceptions and normative values.

My presentation was entitled 'Queer States of Mind' and, with a particular focus on Jamaica, this talk explored how the history of laws governing Anglophone Caribbean sexualities normalize the heteropatriarchal politics of church and state decrees and de-naturalize consenting human desires outside this paradigm. Reading Thomas Glave's 2013 prose meditation, 'Jamaican, Octopus' alongside Shani Mootoo's 2014 novel Walking Sideways Like a Crab I explored the potential of non-realist, non-rationalist literary works to re-engage discourses of the natural in a creative way so as to re-imagine how a queer state of mind - post-gender and even post-species - might issue a distinctive and positive challenge to models of erotic citizenship in the region.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b632635902a1.41060859</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.madness.ulg.ac.be/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica on 'Embracing Jamaican Sexualities' initiated and organised by PI.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B34A0C7C-146E-4779-B178-803D559AC44F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop, organised by the PI in collaboration with Dr Annecke Marshall of the Institute for Gender and Development Studies brought together a wide range of individuals and organisations working on the topic of LGBTIQ rights. The organisations who presented include: Caribbean Dawn; Eve for Life; J-FLAG; PRIDE in action; Quality of Citizenship Jamaica; National Anti-Discrimination Alliance and J-Flag. There were also individual presentations by Taitu Heron on Gender-based Violence and the LGBT Community In Jamaica, by Dean Ellen Grizzle from UTTech Kingston on Building Tolerance in Education and a recorded presentation by Javed Jaghai on Media &amp;amp; questions of representation.

There was a mixed audience of educators, academics, health workers, activist, students and the general public. Participants were very frank with each other and the workshop stimulated a great deal of discussion about who among the LGBTI communities has visibility and access to media representation and who is more invisible. The reasons behind this situation were also explored - e.g. how HIV/AIDS and the repeal of the buggery law has left lesbian and bi women behind in terms of research and visibility &amp;amp; how class and locational politics remain key obstacles to overcome in building solidarities. The different activist groups broadly agreed that there was a need for more collaboration and information sharing. The plight of trans people was highlighted and we were able to circulate the links to Dwayne's House more widely.

The event opened with the first screening in Jamaica of &amp;quot;The Abominable Crime&amp;quot;, a documentary by Micah Fink/Common Good Productions. [Jamaica, 2013] that follows the lives of LGBT individuals both in Jamaica and in exile. The event closed with a stirring and provocative reading by Thomas Glave, the American-Jamaican writer and activist and with a theatre piece by Uoptis, '&amp;quot;WHO AM I? MAN? LETS TALK'.






As a result of the workshop LGBT activists - both groups and individuals - were able to contact each other and to act in fuller awareness of each other's experiences and beliefs. Several participants sent written feedback to suggest the value of workshopping across different organisations and interest groups and the uniqueness of the forum that the workshop provided. 

After the workshop I was able to put the filmmakers of The Abominable Crime in touch with the Caribbean section of the International Research Network which resulted in screenings in Guyana and elsewhere. I was also able to connect with colleagues in Toronto and Barbados so that screenings could be arranged in those locations.

The need to preserve anonymity in the context of the acute homophobia of Jamaica means that it is hard to gather evidence for much of the impact of this event within Jamaica. News of this event has, however, led to further invitations to speak and engage in discussions in Reading, UK as part of the Jamaican Cultural Conference; in Bristol as part of the Jamaica Rising Festival and in Brooklyn, USA as part of a panel on Contemporary Issues in the Caribbean.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f9a7236c6e4.17538044</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://pulitzercenter.org/event/the-abominable-crime-fink-documentary-homophobia-university-west-indies-mona-kingston-jamaica</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad on 'Sexualities in the Tent', 12-13 July 2013, initiated and organised by PI.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE8C514D-2211-4EAC-8643-5F372DC79415</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The different activities of the two-day workshop generated different results. The evening session on Friday 12 July was open to the public and focused on creative expressions of plural sexualities with calypso, literature and performance poetry. This busy session resulted in increased awareness of the existing range of Trinidadian cultural outputs that have already articulated a range of sexual possibilities and help to contest the idea of queer impossibility within the Caribbean region. The Saturday day-time session was a closed session of invited participants and offered a forum to share thoughts and work with others through presentations by academics, researchers, activists, service providers and NGOS in the field of LGBT and sexualities study. The workshop had no pre-planned outcomes but it did lead to future collaborations and publications. 


As a result of the events, lots of people commented on how valuable it had been to them in terms of raising awareness and improving understanding.

After my talk, lots of audience members came to ask me for names of authors and novels so that they could go and read the works that I had referred to for themselves.
