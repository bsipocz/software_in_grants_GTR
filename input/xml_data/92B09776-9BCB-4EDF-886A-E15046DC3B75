Babies with chromosomal abnormalities have complex problems, often associated with developmental disability. Parents faced with this knowledge have to make difficult choices; some opt not to continue the pregnancy. Testing for chromosome problems involves an 'invasive' procedure (e.g. amniocentesis) which can sometimes cause a miscarriage. Major chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Down's syndrome) can be detected using a technique called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Smaller and less common imbalances require the baby's cells to be grown and examined. This procedure (karyotyping) is slow, labour intensive and only detects large imbalances that can be seen down the microscope. Array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) is a new molecular test that can rapidly detect smaller (sub-microscopic) imbalances. When used in children with undiagnosed developmental disability it has detected imbalances (not detected by karyotyping) in 10% of cases. There is very little experience of using aCGH on fetal samples but small studies suggest it may detect 5-10% more imbalances than karyotyping. However, performing and interpreting array CGH is complex as not all imbalances cause problems - some are inherited from a parent and others appear not to have any adverse effect, so more tests are needed to understand the significance of a newly detected imbalance. We now know that the baby?s genetic material (DNA) is present in the mother?s blood and research has shown that this DNA can be used to diagnose Down?s syndrome. This means that we may be able to detect babies with this condition non-invasively by taking a sample of the mother?s blood, thereby avoiding the miscarriage risk associated with invasive testing (NIPD). This study will recruit 1500 fetuses being karyotyped because of an abnormality detected on a scan. NIPD will be performed using the mother?s blood sample. Arrays will be performed on villi and amniotic fluid cells in 6 genetics laboratories using agreed guidelines. In addition to the standard karyotype information, clinicians/parents will be informed of imbalances detected by aCGH where the significance is known (based on similar cases reported in the medical literature). We need costs for the arrays and the scientists to perform them. NHS costs are requested for midwives to recruit parents. In addition, we will find out what parents, health professionals and commissioners think of the new technology. We will make recommendations as to whether array CGH should replace fetal karyotyping.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The study will evaluate the efficacy of prenatal array CGH and address the hypothesis that array CGH detects more de novo pathogenic chromosomal imbalances than standard karyotyping. It will also evaluate NIPD for Down?s syndrome. DESIGN: Multicentre experimental study with cost analysis and qualitative sub-study POPULATION: Trios (fetus+parents) will be recruited from 11 Fetal Medicine Centres across England &amp;amp; Wales. Fetuses with (a) structural anomaly identified at the 11-14 or 18-21 week screening scan or (b) isolated nuchal translucency &amp;gt;3mm identified at the 11-14 week screening scan, undergoing karyotyping. INTERVENTIONS: Cell free DNA will be extracted from maternal plasma samples for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of Down?s syndrome. In all cases with a normal PCR aCGH using either either a 60K or 135 K oligonucleotide array will be performed on fetal DNA extracted from villi or amniocytes in 6 molecular cytogenetic laboratories. Where the array identifies a putative copy number variant (CNV), further studies on parental/fetal DNA will be conducted using parent versus parent (sex mis-matched array), FISH or MLPA. Standard amniocyte/chorion villus G-banded karyotyping will be performed in all cases as per current clinical guidelines. OUTCOMES: Primary ? (1) Detection of pathogenic chromosomal imbalances by karyotyping and pathogenic CNVs by by array CGH. CNVs will be defined as pathogenic, benign or of uncertain clinical significance based on size, gene content and inheritance pattern. (2) sensitivity and specificity of NIPD for Down?s syndrome. Secondary - (a) Detection of chromosome imbalances and CNVs of uncertain clinical significance; (b) Turn-around times for array CGH, karyotyping and NIPD; (c) Costs to NHS and personal social services of array CGH and karyotyping and cost per additional pathogenic CNV detected by array CGH (and associated follow up testing) relative to karyotyping; (d) Parent and health professional attitudes to array CGH: a qualitative sub-study will determine views on array CGH and desirability and feasibility of replacing karyotyping with array CGH in prenatal diagnosis. SAMPLE SIZE AND ANALYSIS: A sample of 500 cases from each of the target populations will give in excess of 90% power to detect a difference in detection rates at the 5% significance level assuming that karyotyping and array CGH detect pathogenic imbalances in 5% and 10% of cases respectively. For the qualitative sub-study, semi-structured in-depth interviews will be undertaken in 12-15 health professionals and 12-15 parents. Using the Wilson method and 1500 cases for evaluation of NIPD, for a sensitivity of 100% the 95% CI will be 97.7-100%. TIMETABLE &amp;amp; PROJECT TEAM: The team led by Robson (Fetal Medicine) and Chitty (Genetics) includes expertise in Clinical Genetics, Molecular Cytogenetics, Health Economics, Statistics and Sociology as well as lay representation. Team members have collaborated extensively on prior/current NIHR grants. The large number of collaborating centres ensures that the study can be completed over 3 years.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1506204</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D76CCC7-96BE-4284-9BAF-39ACF92AECA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Perspective on the technical challenges involved in the implantation of array-CGH in prenatal diagnosis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diagnostic Molecular Pathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b708a2598ba7786507a8ee8eb4ba6882"><gtr:id>b708a2598ba7786507a8ee8eb4ba6882</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Callaway JLA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54648c023b7ce0.01296116</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BFF8B9CE-2E6B-44F0-A3ED-FA182E9B3896</gtr:id><gtr:title>Confined placental mosaicism: implications for fetal chromosomal analysis using microarray comparative genomic hybridization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Prenatal diagnosis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6e5cdcff5600af496aaed271b0739ebb"><gtr:id>6e5cdcff5600af496aaed271b0739ebb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karampetsou E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0197-3851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5464902cf21880.64962382</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E55BBEE6-EA97-4243-BB6A-1D81BC2BF76D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The clinical utility of microarray technologies applied to prenatal cytogenetics in the presence of a normal conventional karyotype: a review of the literature.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Prenatal diagnosis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6efa8715ad98238a81380a8a50d8e407"><gtr:id>6efa8715ad98238a81380a8a50d8e407</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Callaway JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0197-3851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54648f211d3a38.59000716</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_12031</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>3BEA012A-C817-4067-8BE1-05331EBB5152</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.2  Evaluation of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
