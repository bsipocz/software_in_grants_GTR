However, a smORF could either be used to make a short protein (called a peptide), or it could just be 'junk' DNA - distinguishing between these two possibilities is not easy. An animal genome typically contains tens of thousands of 'normal' genes, but it also contains hundreds of thousands of smORFs of less than 100 amino acids. Given that using only computer methods it is almost impossible to predict which of these smORFs are made into peptides and which are not, the prevailing strategy has been to simply ignore them. Our research team uses multidisciplinary, cutting edge laboratory and computational techniques to detect which smORFs actually get made into short proteins, and thus, are actual active genes. This is important because, by so far ignoring these smORF genes, we could be missing the solutions to many biological and medical problems, and we may have attributed some solutions to the wrong genes.
Our previous work indicates that there is a class composed or about 800 smORFs that offers the best chance to i) understand general principles of smORF function, and ii) produce peptides with functions of biomedical importance. Our previous work suggests that this class of smORF produces short proteins that locate to the membranes of cells and other cell organelles; and that these short membrane proteins work as repressors (or 'brakes') of normal proteins (i.e. those longer than 100 amino acids). In this project we plan to corroborate these hypotheses by:
 A) characterising in detail the molecular function of two smORF peptides, for which we already know their general function, and the normal proteins that they are regulating. The first smORF peptide regulates a type of cell-to-cell signalling that is involved in cancer and stem-cell-biology; the second peptide is needed by the cells of the immune system to digest bacteria, but in the presence of a specific pollutant called TMT, can produce brain damage.
B) corroborating that these 800 smORF peptides localise to cell membranes, using a cutting edge technique that we have developed in our laboratory. In addition, we aim to identify also the normal proteins that these smORF membrane peptides may be regulating.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) encoding peptides of less than 100 amino-acids are emerging as a fundamental and pervasive gene class, found in the hundreds of thousands in metazoan genomes. Our laboratory has pioneered the identification and functional characterization of smORFs, using Drosophila as a model system, and showing that smORFs are translated in their thousands (Ladoukakis 2011, Genome Biology; Aspden 2014, eLife), and that their peptides can have important functions in development and physiology (Galindo 2007, PLoS Biology; Magny 2013, Science). Nonetheless, the vast majority of smORFs remain uncharacterized and key questions remain, such as whether smORF peptides have a wide variety of functions (as do canonical proteins) or specific molecular roles (as do microRNAs for example). We have identified a class of smORF encoding putative membrane peptides, which offer the best chance to i) understand general principles of smORF function, and ii) produce peptides with essential cellular functions of biomedical importance. Our published and preliminary data suggest that smORF membrane peptides work as negative regulators of canonical proteins. Here we plan to corroborate this hypothesis by:

A) characterising in detail the molecular roles of two smORFs, involved respectively in Wnt signalling (a cancer and stem-cell-related cell signalling cascade); and in endocytotic membrane traffic (regulating macrophage phagocytosis and neurodegeneration);

B) testing the membrane association of this class of smORF peptides at the genomic scale with a further development of our ribosomal profiling technique; and identifying binding partners and characteristic binding domains.
 
As in our previous and successful work in this area, we will use a multidisciplinary combination of developmental genetics, cell biology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry, using and developing new cutting edge-techniques in Drosophila and in vertebrates.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries: This is a basic research project, and the short-term beneficiaries will be academic. The general public will obtain health benefits in the longer term, since we focus our research on peptides likely to have basic cellular and signalling functions of biomedical importance: in addition to this project, we have already characterised peptides involved in embryonic development, heart arrhythmia and immune function (Galindo et al. 2007, Magny et al. 2013, Pueyo et al. in prep.). In the medium term, economic benefits can arise from our engagement with industry partners to bring about these long-term benefits, and to disseminate our technical advances. 

Application and exploitation: We have previous experience of using the University's pipeline for IP exploitation with our smORF peptides. Here we have identified the following opportunities arising from this project:
1) An agreement in principle with Dr. Bassett (Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University) to design a library of constructs allowing CRISPR-based mutation of the smORF peptides identified in this project, to be commercialised by his facility. 
2) Synthesis and commercialisation of a library of smORF peptides for pharmacological screening. Feasibility agreed in principle with our previous industry partner Dr. Perez-Alonso (Valentia BioPharma and Imegen- Spain).

Communications and dissemination:
Mixed Industry-Academy: I will continue to be involved with Oxford Global (since 2010), as a speaker and advisor. This company organises conferences with mixed contribution from industry and academia, targeted to an industry audience, aiming to increase the dissemination of knowledge between academia and industry, and to create business opportunities for both. 
I will be an invited contributor to a workshop at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Center, aiming to establish guidelines and consolidate the list of found and yet-to be validated human protein products. This effort will aid the genomic research community in general and all industry, clinical and academic users of human genome data. Following on, we plan to help Dr. Harrow to annotate the vertebrate peptides studied in section 3.2 of our project.
Academy: In addition to this, we regularly present our results at national and international academic venues (see CVs and academic beneficiaries for details).
Online and general public engagement: We follow open-access guidelines in the publication of our results. Our laboratory web pages include links to copies of our articles downloadable from a University repository. We work with the Sussex Press Office to prepare press releases of our research, and we endeavour to reach the general public ourselves, through magazines, web sites, TV channels, and Twitter. 

Capacity building: Our team develops not only cutting-edge technical skills but also professional transferable skills though our own activities and University courses. These include: 1) presentational skills, at weekly group meetings, conferences and our annual retreat; 2) writing skills, through writing progress reports, conference abstracts, scientific papers, and grant applications; 3) data handling through the analysis of large scale data-sets using Galaxy, spreadsheets, EMBOSS suite, TopHat and Python and Perl scripts in Unix and Windows environments; 4) project management, at our retreat and in regular meetings with the PI. In addition, the supervision of the postgraduate technician (Sarah Bishop) will enhance Dr. Pueyo's leadership skills, and continued IP and Spanish industry contacts should broaden his career options outside academia. Dr. Magny will have an active role in web dissemination and monitoring of Twitter coverage of our research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>739114</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have corroborated that a small gene, called Pegasus (Peg for short) produces a peptide that regulates a cell signal. We have generated a transgenic fly carrying a modified Peg peptide, and we see it co-localising with the cell signalling machinery. We have also generated Peg mutants using CRISPR gene editing, and corroborated that Peg is needed for the development of the fly. 
We have observed that Peg affects targets of the cell signal, as expected from our initial hypothesis that Peg encoded a signal regulator. Also as expected, the Peg gene interacts strongly genetically with other such regulators. 
In summary, we have been able to corroborate our initial hypothesis that Peg encodes a regulator of cell signals. Work continues to establish the molecular basis of this function.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once this work on the Pegasus gene is close to be submitted for publication we will present our work in conferences to academic, healthcare and industrial audiences.
Once it is published in an Open access journal, it will be available to such audiences worldwide.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F9FDE24-AE9A-4FD9-8C06-7C7C62C24BD0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deb686b81a71.21149048</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BABADA49-F9FC-435B-A422-C60D2E677BF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Classification and function of small open reading frames.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
