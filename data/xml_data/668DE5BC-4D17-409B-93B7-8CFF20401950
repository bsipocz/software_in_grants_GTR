This process of DNA replication occurs in the S-phase of the cell cycle and is performed by complex protein machines, which are assembled onto DNA at chromosomal sites known as replication origins. These machines unwind the DNA double helix to form &amp;quot;fork&amp;quot; structures, at which the copying occurs. During the S-phase, origins &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; each releasing a pair of &amp;quot;replication forks&amp;quot; that travel in opposite directions away from their site of initiation. DNA replication is completed when forks from adjacent origins merge. Problems that occur during both the initiation and elongation phases of replication are well known to cause chromosomal alterations and catastrophic mutations that are instrumental in the ageing process, and in the development of age related diseases such as cancer. However, very little is known about the mutagenic potential of replication termination, when replication forks merge. Unlike replication initiation, replication termination can occur at any site in the genome and this makes it difficult to study. My laboratory has pioneered the use of site-specific replication fork barriers to focus termination at specific chromosomal locations. Using this approach we have discovered a novel process by which deletions of chromosomal DNA can occur during replication termination. The aim of this project is to determine exactly how these deletions arise, and the various factors that govern their occurrence. Deletions of chromosomal DNA erode the genetic information that is vital for maintaining the health and function of cells. By understanding the mechanisms that cause these deletions, and the factors that influence their frequency, we will be better placed in the future to assess an individual's capacity for healthy ageing, and to devise measures for assuaging the worst effects of the ageing process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Problems that arise during DNA replication can cause genomic alterations that are a major driver of ageing and age related diseases such as cancer, as well as being instrumental in the development of many human genetic disorders. Replication fork barriers are one common problem encountered, which can cause the dissociation of replisome components (fork collapse), and act as hotspots for replication termination, where replisomes from adjacent replication origins converge. Collapsed forks can be rescued by homologous recombination, which restarts replication. However, replication restart is a relatively slow process and, therefore, replication termination frequently occurs here by an active fork converging on a collapsed fork. In preliminary work we have discovered that this type of non-canonical fork convergence in fission yeast is prone to trigger very high frequencies of deletions between repetitive DNA sequences. We hypothesise that deletions occur during replication termination via a novel mechanism that we call inter-fork strand annealing (IFSA). Due to the abundance of repetitive DNA elements in the human genome, we suspect that IFSA presents a major and completely novel threat to human genome stability that likely contributes to ageing and age related diseases. Using a combination of state-of-the-art genetic, live cell imaging and biochemical approaches, we aim to establish the validity of our model, and uncover the key factors that influence it. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for promoting and suppressing IFSA will provide a platform for future studies that could ultimately lead to the development of new approaches for minimising the deleterious effects of ageing, including novel diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics for diseases such as cancer.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have discovered a new threat to genome integrity that could reduce healthy lifespan and increase age-related diseases such as cancer. By determining the molecular mechanisms that govern this novel process, we will aid future endeavours to develop new strategies for improving lifelong health and well-being of humans. 

The biomedical implications of our work fit within BBSRC's key challenge area &amp;quot;Lifelong Health&amp;quot; under its Strategic Research Priority 3 (&amp;quot;Bioscience for health&amp;quot;).

Beneficiaries will include:

Scientists engaged in the fundamental research on DNA replication, DNA repair and genetic recombination as well as clinicians will be the immediate beneficiaries of our work. The outputs of our research will stimulate further basic and translational research that ultimately will benefit the nation's health through the development of new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools. Other beneficiaries include NHS and other healthcare professionals. 

Students: The molecular mechanisms of DNA replication, DNA repair and genetic recombination are core topics for most students of molecular biology, and the novel process of genomic deletion that we will uncover will likely feature in future additions of standard text books (e.g. Lewin's Genes XI). Our findings will contribute to a more complete description of the mechanisms that cause genomic alteration, as well as those that attempt to limit it, and thereby enhance the molecular biology curriculum to the benefit of future students.

Wider Public: The researcher that will be employed on this grant, together with the PI, will pursue outreach activities through participation in Departmental Science Open Days (e.g. putting on practical demonstrations in molecular biology or microscopy), talks at local schools and providing work experience for school pupils.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>389618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P019706/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6FACFC06-C057-4BBC-8936-6881298CB318</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ageing: chemistry/biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3FE6EA5-4508-4525-8DA5-4D78DF7F3BAC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell cycle</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1163A5D2-CE35-4C7E-904E-6FB2B5FA0C2A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Multiprotein complexes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>74ACE9F6-9B7F-4464-A13F-4DA8063390E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Recombination</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
