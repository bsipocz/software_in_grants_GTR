In the younger age group, this is mainly caused by single gene diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa whilst in the elderly population age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes significant morbidity. Recently, diabetic maculopathy is also emerging in middle age as a significant cause of incurable blindness. What links all these diseases together is loss of photoreceptors, or the light sensing cells that line the back of the eye in the outer retina. Recent developments in gene therapy have shown that it might be possible to alter the micro-cellular environment of the photoreceptors using a viral vector to correct gene defects. The viral vector now established to achieve this is the adeno-associated virus (AAV), a very small particle with no known toxic effects in humans. The viral vector is used to deliver a gene into the photoreceptor cells and the gene then can accomplish its therapeutic effects. Gene therapy for retinal disease therefore has great potential in the future treatment of these currently incurable conditions.

Of all single gene causes of retinitis pigmentosa, X linked disease due to defects in the gene RPGR is the most common. At the same time, X-linked retinitis pigmentosa is regarded the most severe form of retinitis pigmentosa. These patients experience restriction of the peripheral visual field and night blindness already within the first two decades of life. Additionally, glare, involuntary pendular movement of the eyes, colour vision disturbances and reduced central visual acuity are characteristic features. As a result, patients typically become legally blind even before completion of their secondary education. Because of its severe clinical symptoms in patients and its relatively high occurrence compared to other monogenetic disorders, this specific disease is one of the top candidates for the development of a genetic therapy.

The RPGR gene is small enough to fit into AAV, but the expression levels will need to be high to prevent retinal degeneration. The general aim of this project is to optimise RPGR gene expression by applying new developments in AAV vector technology. The focus of the project is to develop a vector that is suitable for use in a clinical trial. For this work, different cell cultures, human samples and existing animals models will be used to achieve optimised treatment results. The proposed project will be carried out in the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford in collaboration with Professor Matt During at the Ohio State University.

The development of gene therapy treatments for single gene defects such as RPGR will be highly relevant to patients affected by that particular disease, but the technology in general has much broader applications to other causes of retinal degeneration such as diabetic maculopathy and AMD. This is because the vector being developed could be used to carry other genes, which might have other therapeutic effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with great genetic and phenotypic variability. Indeed, many different genes have been identified to cause RP, however, approximately 10-20% of all cases feature mutations in the coding sequence for Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR). The overall goal of the proposed project is to lay the ground for a phase I / II clinical trial on the safety and efficacy of gene replacement therapy in patients with mutations in RPGR. As expression levels need to be high enough to convey a therapeutic effect, this project will emphasize the optimisation of transfection and expression efficiency.
 
To achieve this, I will optimise the expression cassette of human cDNA sequence to increase expression efficiency within the transfected cells by codon optimisation of the therapeutic gene sequence. I will analyse performance of resulting sequences through quantitative expression essays in cell culture, human tissue samples and in vivo experiments. 

Secondly, I will test transfection efficiency of modified vectors with targeted alterations of vision capsids, which are reported to escape proteosomal degradation in the target cell to further optimise transfection and expression efficiency in vitro and in vivo.

Once the AAV vector is optimised in terms of expression efficiency, I will use clinical grade viral vectors for in vivo experiments in the existing genetically engineered knockout mouse model. In vivo analysis will use the same state of the art diagnostic equipment and protocols as commonly implemented in clinical trials, such as non-invasive retinal imaging (SLO) and functional testing (ERG). Ex vivo methods will include analysis of transfection and expression efficiency by means of western blot and realtime-qPCR. Rescue of the mouse model phenotype (opsin mislocalization) will be analyzed by immuno-histochemistry.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In terms of further development from the laboratory research outlined in this proposal, there are a number of commercial private sector companies both in the UK, Europe and worldwide (e.g. Oxford BioMedica, Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics, AstraZeneca) focusing on gene therapy and related services, which are likely to indirectly benefit from the newly generated knowledge. Especially in terms of increased understanding of innovative ways to increase transduction efficiency and expression characteristics with codon-optimisation and use of vectors with altered capsid structure. Intermediate- and long-term benefit for public and private sector researchers will be the further translation of the results of the proposed project into a clinical application. However, this step will firstly and foremost benefit the patients with the respective retinal degenerative disease, which otherwise would render them blind, as currently no cure exists for this form of continuous loss of light sensing photoreceptor cells. As a clinician about to undertake a predoctoral fellowship, I am not an expert on how biotechnology developments funded by the MRC might be developed commercially, but I am aware that Isis Innovations has a track record of doing this within Oxford where appropriate.

Since photoreceptor loss is a common final pathway also in other, more prevalent blinding disorders, such as AMD and diabetic retinopathy, one could argue, that advances in the development of novel therapeutic options against photoreceptor cell loss might be also beneficial for the development of future applications in these highly prevalent disorders. AMD and diabetic retinopathy are by far the most common reason for blindness in the industrialised nations. The demographic change will greatly increase the absolute number of affected individuals and challenge the health systems of developed societies. Visual disability is not only regarded an extremely frustrating disability with considerable loss of quality of life, but also has a substantial and increasing socioeconomic impact as working age is likely to increase in future. Therefore, any advances in the development of novel treatment options in retinal blinding disorders have the potential to impact on the nation's health and wealth, while substantially increasing the quality of life of patients affected by these visual disabilities.

The proposed research project is planned for 3 years and new insights into the potential pitfalls and solutions for this form of gene therapy are expected within this timeframe. As clinician scientist, I am foremost interested in translating new knowledge into clinical useful applications and my sponsor, Professor MacLaren, is one of the leading clinician scientists with pioneering expertise in the clinical application of retinal gene therapy: &amp;quot;Gene therapy: New hopes to halt blindness&amp;quot; (BBC 6 O'clock News and News at Ten: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15489494, 28/10/11). Indeed, he is currently leading the world's first multi-centre gene therapy trial to treat photoreceptors in patients with probably the second most prevalent x-linked retinal degeneration (after RPGR), known as choroideraemia (NCT01461213). This local clinical and scientific expertise in combination with pre-established logistical pathways, specifically trained study personnel in the eye clinic and legal knowhow all make the actual translation of the research results into a clinical trial extremely likely. Nevertheless, this is pioneering work in a sensitive area of biomedical research. Hence consultations with the respective local and national competent authorities will take time and additional funding will have to be secured before such a venture can be carried out in the clinical setting. I predict that the first patient with this particular retinal blinding disorder might be treated within 5 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
