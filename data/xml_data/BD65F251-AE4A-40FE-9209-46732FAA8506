One person in every ten infected people progress to disease during their lifetime, leading to two million deaths a year worldwide. BCG vaccine is the only vaccine against TB but it isn't very effective in the developing world. It provides protection against the development serious forms of TB in childhood, but provides little protection in adults. The reason for this is unknown but we think it may be due to specific cells in the body called regulatory T cells. This is what we would like to investigate. Our aim is to study these cells and their relationship to BCG vaccination so that we can we can help develop a vaccine that will provide better protection for children and adults against TB.200 babies will either be vaccinated at birth (100 babies), or at 4.5 months (100 babies), and immune responses will be compared between the 2 groups. This will enable us to study the development and regulation of the immune response to TB before or after BCG vaccination.We are measuring immune responses in blood taken at birth, 4.5 and 9 months of age. All children will have a special skin test at 4.5 months to examine for reactivity which might be explained by exposure to other bacteria like TB in the environment. The children are followed up monthly for a routine health check throughout the trial and then every 3 months until 3 years of age.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BCG is the only available vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) yet its protective efficacy is highly variable for unknown reasons. The most widely accepted explanation is that natural immunity to atypical mycobacteria renders BCG less effective. Twenty two percent of 3 month old Gambian infants exhibited a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) without BCG vaccination, suggesting priming by environmental mycobacteria. Recently, specialised regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to control immune responses to self / foreign antigens. We hypothesise that Tregs are induced by exposure to environmental mycobacteria and attenuate the immunogenicity of BCG. 200 babies are being recruited at birth and randomised to receive BCG vaccination either immediately (n=100) or at 4.5 months (n=100). We are examining immunological responses to various mycobacterial and M tuberculosis specific antigens at birth, 4.5 and 9 months of age by flow cytometry, cytokine secretion and gene expression. All participants have a TST at 4.5 months to examine for reactivity which might be explained by environmental mycobacterial exposure. Each child is followed up monthly during the trial for morbidity and anthropometric assessment and then every three months until 3 years of age.We will assess whether the immune response to BCG is attenuated in those with pre-exposure to environmental mycobacteria, and whether Treg levels are related to the quality of the immune response to BCG. This study aims to create a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the poor efficacy of BCG in the developing world and should help in the design of strategies to increase the protective efficacy of BCG. Moreover, further insights into the role of Tregs in the development of TB specific immunity in early life may provide novel approaches for the development of the newer generation TB vaccines that are being developed throughout the world. One vaccine approach has been to prime with BCG and boost with a recombinant TB antigen, and our findings are likely to be particularly applicable to those taking this TB vaccine approach.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1705168</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Harvard University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Harvard T.H.
