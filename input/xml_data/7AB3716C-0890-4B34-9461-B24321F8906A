They carry out all of the functions that sustain life, from metabolism through replication to the exchange of information between a cell and its environment. They are coded for by a 'blueprint' in the form of the DNA sequence in the genome, which describes how to make them as linear strings of building blocks. In order to function, however, most macromolecules fold into a precise 3D structure, which in turn depends primarily on the sequence of building blocks from which they are made. Knowledge of the molecule's 3D structure allows us both to understand its function, and to design chemicals to interfere with it.

Due to advances in molecular biology, a number of projects, including the Human Genome Project, have led to the determination of the complete DNA sequences of many organisms, from which we can now read the linear blueprints for many macromolecules. As yet, however, the 3D structure cannot be predicted from knowledge of the sequence alone. One way to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; macromolecules, and so to determine their 3D structure, involves initially crystallising the molecule under investigation, and subsequently imaging it with suitable radiation. 

Macromolecules are too small to see with normal light, and so a different approach is required. With an optical microscope we cannot see objects which are smaller than the wavelength of light, roughly 1 millionth of a metre: Atoms are about 1000 times smaller than this. However X-rays have a wavelength about the same as the size of the atoms. For this reason, in order to resolve the atomic detail of macromolecular structure, we image them with X-rays rather than with visible light. The process of imaging the structures of macromolecules that have been crystallised is known as X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is like using a microscope to magnify objects that are too small to be seen with visible light. Unfortunately X-ray crystallography is complicated because, unlike a microscope, there is no lens system for X-rays and so additional information and complex computation are required to reconstruct the final image. This information may come from known protein structures using the Molecular Replacement (MR) method, or from other sources including Electron Microscopy (EM).

Once the structure is known, it is easier to pinpoint how macromolecules contribute to the living cellular machinery. Pharmaceutical research uses this as the basis for designing drugs to turn the molecules on or off when required. Drugs are designed to interact with the target molecule to either block or promote the chemical processes which they perform within the body. Other applications include protein engineering and carbohydrate engineering.

The aim of this project is to improve the key computational tools needed to extract a 3D structure from X-ray crystallography experiments. It will provide continuing support to a Collaborative Computing Project (CCP4 first established in 1979), which has become one of the leading sources of software for this task. The project will help efficient and effective use to be made of the synchrotrons that make the X-rays that are used in most crystallographic experiments. It will provide more powerful tools to allow users to exploit information from known protein structures when the match to the unknown structure is very poor. It will also automate the use of information from electron microscopy, even when the crystal structure has been distorted by the process of growing the protein crystal. Finally, it will allow structures to be solved, even when poor quality and very small crystals are obtained.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal incorporates five related work packages.

In WP1 we will track synchrotron-collected data through computational structure determination, to find whether the most useful data can be recognised a priori using established or novel metrics of data quality and consistency. We will then enable data collection software to communicate with pipelines and graphics programs to assess when sufficient data have been collected for a given scientific question, and so to prioritise further beamtime usage. We will also communicate extra information about diffraction data to structure determination programs, and so support the statistical models and algorithms being developed in WP4.

WP2 will improve the key MR step of model preparation, especially from diverged, NMR, or ab initio models. One development will be to extend the size limit of ab initio search model generation by exploiting sequence covariance algorithms.

In WP3 we will use our description of electron density maps as a field of control points to better use electron density or atomic models positioned by MR. Restrained manipulation of these points provides a low-order parameterisation of refinement decoupled from atomic models, and therefore suitable for highly diverged atomic models or EM-derived maps. We will extend this approach to characterise local protein mobility without the requirement of TLS for predefinition of rigid groups.

In WP4 we will statistically model non-idealities in experimental data, including non isomorphism, spot overlap, and radiation damage. The resulting models, implemented in REFMAC, will be applied to refinement using data that are annotated by WP1 tools and tracked by WP0.

WP0 will provide the tools to integrate the other WPs. For this, it will create a cloud environment where storage- and compute-resources can be utilised optimally, and where rich information can be passed among beamlines, pipelines, and graphics programs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Noble (Newcastle University) and Brown (University of Kent) are chairman and chairman elect of CCP4, and have responsibility for delivery of its software development, maintenance, distribution, and outreach programs. The impact of their contribution arises from this proposal's capacity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of macromolecular crystallography, and thereby the commercial and academic research that depends upon it. Further impact arises from CCP4s role in disseminating and training a workforce for this commercially important, high-skill technology.

MX is an essential enabling technology for the cellular and molecular biosciences, and consequently for UK pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. UK research councils and research charities have recognised the need for infrastructural support of the discipline, most recently by allocating a highly-prized beamline at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) for use as a state-of-the-art facility for micro-focus and in situ crystallography for the academic and commercial MX community. In turn, the biotechnological and pharmaceutical science base that is fostered by such investments contributes hugely to the UK economy: in 2010 the pharmaceutical sector provided 67,000 jobs, each contributing &amp;pound;195,000 of GVA, with 25,000 of these positions being in high skill R&amp;amp;D activities (source: http://www.abpi.org.uk). In particular the majority of industrial access to DLS is for MX - amounting to almost 20% of the total user activity in MX.

Collaborative Computational Project 4 (CCP4) was established by the Research Councils in 1979 to promote the development and dissemination of software and best-practice in MX. To this end, it uses Research Council funding to leverage commercial income (over 130 commercial licenses generating over &amp;pound;1M/annum), which it invests in MX training and in software development, maintenance, and distribution. As such, grant funding of CCP4 has the additional impact of strengthening an impoant interface between UK academic and commercial science.

CCP4s dissemination activities include hosting an annual methods-development meeting, attended by 400-500 graduate students, young researchers and PIs. It also co-sponsors with the British Crystallographic Association annual week-long summer schools, held alternately in Scotland and England, at which cohorts of 40+ graduates are intensively trained in current methods in protein crystallography. These two elements, supported mostly by CCP4s commercial license income, help to keep the UK at the forefront of MX development, and ensure that a pool of well-trained, interdisciplinary scientists are available to apply the technique in academic and/or commercial settings.

The program of work described here, for which Noble and Brown will have ultimate oversight, looks forward to the next stage of the development of MX, to address some of the outstanding obstacles that limit the success and/or efficient application of the technique. It focuses on current and future required developments to work on more challenging samples and includes methods development to optimally utilise multiple samples (key to the use of in-situ data collection). The developments will remove bottlenecks and allow structures to be determined from ever more challenging targets, including membrane proteins and proteins for which sample preparation is inherently difficult. This work will impact directly upon areas of biomedical and otherwise commercial interest. For example, WP0, WP1 and WP4 address the challenge of maximising output from challenging samples, while WP2 and WP3 extend the utility of the molecular replacement approach which accounts for phasing of most datasets. These packages address known bottlenecks in the determination of structures for membrane proteins, a protein class for which structural information is badly needed (since &amp;gt; 50% of drugs target are membrane proteins), but notoriously hard to obtain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11705</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Crystallographic computing training workshop (APS)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7A38DD6-EED8-47F4-868E-E213E905F6D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training students to use advanced feature of crystallographic software.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd86d89defd4.95607101</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/schools/APS-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IUCr conference workshop, Montreal 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DEE27C2-F507-4E89-8104-000FF968CF76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Education in practical application of AMPLE

2nd - 4th March 2016

This course is aimed at structural biologists with high resolution EM maps ready for / in the process of modelling building and refinement. This three day course will host some of the leading software developers and provide ample contact time to allow delegates to discuss their data in detail alongside traditional lectures and tutorials.

The principal benefit to the participants was an awareness of tools which can perform de-novo model building in high resolution EM maps, removing the model bias associated with fitting pre-determined structures and facilitating the use of EM when no prior structure is available. The principal benefit to us was contact with real EM data and users, giving us a better awareness of the problems to be solved.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b55a29c23a96.91501448</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/training/icknield_2016/icknield_schedule.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DLS-CCP4 Data Collection and Structure Solution Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>14717D89-311A-4375-9379-827100E4A475</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DLS-CCP4 Data Collection and Structure Solution Workshop

WP0: Our central aim is to develop a cloud-computing infrastructure by which CCP4 software and computational resources can be made available to the community. Technical specifications for the setup of CCP4 Cloud have been developed in coordination with STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD). The Cloud will be represented by a system of virtual machines running CCP4 Software through the newly released CCP4 Graphical Interface version 2 (CCP4i2 in CCP4 release 7.0, January 2016), which provides all necessary job and data handling. Cloud virtual machines will be accessible through a common browser without the needs for client software to be installed locally. In contrast to other cloud-computing endeavours, CCP4 Cloud will have a persistent storage for every registered user, where original data and the intermediate steps of crystallographic computations will be stored. A further differentiating feature of CCP4 Cloud will be the ability to run computationally expensive jobs on a dedicated computational facility such as the SCARF cluster at STFC/SCD. Finally, there will be data exchange between CCP4 Cloud and data producing facilities, such as beamlines at Diamond Light Source, as well as between local CCP4 setups (e.g. on individual laptops) and the Cloud. Currently we have a working set of Cloud virtual machines with CCP4i2 running on them, complemented with a set of dedicated modules for running CPU-intensive jobs on SCD's SCARF facility. The system is at the end of 1st development stage, available for preliminary testing and feedback by a chosen set of interested users (on-going). Further stages will include implementation of data exchange protocols between Diamond and CCP4 Cloud and development of a Restful API for running CCP4 tasks in the Cloud directly from data producing facilities and users desktops. Crystallographic Cloud services may also be provided via a dedicated web-application, based on a light-weight framework of computational servers communicating via ordinary http or https protocol. The framework is sufficiently abstracted in respect to both the content (data and task types it operates on) and hardware (the type and location of computational nodes), which makes it effectively a Cloud setup. Such a framework is useful in the context of collaborative computational projects as it allows for resource crowd-sourcing by the inclusion of additional computers and clusters at any point. The framework is now being developed and is expected to be released in 2018. The first release will contain all major CCP4 automatic structure solution pipelines, complemented with data import, export and analysis functions.

WP1: Our central aim is to allow the results of real-time data analysis to inform experimental decisions on synchrotron beamlines. We have collected and curated test data sets for software development; currently the repository contains ~10TB of data which accounts for ~500 PDB structures. A summer placement student has been recruited for June-September 2017 to link data sets to meta data in a data base. We aim to open the database for broader use by the community before the end of the grant. Towards identifying predictive metrics of dataset quality ~100 data sets have been used to test diffraction data quality indicators (I/sigI, CC1/2, Rpim, completeness) in proof-of-principal statistical analysis; a histogram showing success / failure of correct space-group identification in conjunction with these quality indicators has been created and showed promising indicative properties. Coding has also been initiated to implement decision making in existing MX structure-determination pipelines. In addition, we are collaborating closely with MRC LMB (Murshudov and Evans) on model independent evaluation of electron density map quality in order to drive our learning algorithms by assessing success in a robust manner.

WP2: Our central aim is to enhance the exploitation of existing structural knowledge and improving ab-initio structure prediction methods to increase the throughput and quality of macromolecular structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Predicted residue contacts derived from evolutionary covariance have been shown to improve ab initio model quality and make larger and more beta-rich proteins tractable to MR structure solution by AMPLE. Alternative strategies for sampling from clusters of ab initio models have been extensively compared: performance benefits can be expected from implementing the best of these. Exploration of AMPLE's performance on transmembrane helical targets is underway. The introduction of new features in Phaser has improved success rates in two molecular replacement pipelines. An improvement in the statistical treatment of ensemble models in Phaser was particularly relevant to AMPLE, whereas the introduction of &amp;quot;gyre&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gimble&amp;quot; refinement (the likelihood equivalents of PC-refinement) were important for Arcimboldo.

WP3: Our central is to develop atomic model refinement against diffraction data produced using multiple crystals. We have already developed a method and corresponding software - LORESTER for reusing information in the PDB about macromolecules under study. Infrastructure for full multiple crystal refinement is now in place and we have already started development of full multi-crystal refinement tools.

Within clipper_tools: 
 em.cut_density - cuts a part of a cryoEM map using a mask computed from a supplied model, applies sharpening or blurring, computes map coefficients and produces a mini MTZ file and XML/logfile results. This will be employed by future versions of the phaser pipeline for molecular replacement with EM maps.
