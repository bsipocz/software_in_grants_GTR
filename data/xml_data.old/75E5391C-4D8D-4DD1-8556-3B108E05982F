The project carried out surveys of different kinds and targeted excavations at the site of Sais (Sa el-Hagar) in the western Nile Delta, Egypt, as well as a survey of around seventy sites in the north and western areas of the Nile Delta. The main aim of the project was to understand the relationship between the river floodplain environment and human settlement throughout the last seven thousand years. The main idea tested was that the changing positions of the river systems, level of annual flooding and the abandonment of river branches has had a major impact upon human settlement in this region. \n\nThe research time will enable me to concentrate upon the following aspects of the articles:\no To analyse and consider the results of the excavation and survey work carried out in the 'Sais and its Hinterland Project';\no To analyse and consider the results of the survey and geological work from the regional survey work in Beheira province (west) and Kafr esh-Sheikh province (north);\no To carry out additional library research for both articles. Research on the environment and geological aspects of the articles can be carried out at the same time;\no To compile data from the geological survey and create computer generated models of the underlying sediment layers (palaeotopography) in relation to the archaeological areas;\no To write the text and notes for the articles;\no To compile the maps and photographs for the articles.\nIn all cases some parts of the work listed above have been completed already, but the research leave will enable me to concentrate upon gathering all of the material together in a publishable form.\nThe first article 'Sais and its Hinterland: Dynamics of Settlement and Power in the Western Nile Delta' will contain an account of the human settlement development of this specific area from the early Neolithic period (ca. 4,800 BC) onward and of the way in which the river played a role in that development. It will aim to show that when the river and its branches 'behaved' then the towns here could thrive and in some cases have considerable political and economic power. \nThe second article 'Settlement and Abandonment in the North and Western Delta from 3rd century BC to 10th century AD' is based upon survey work in the north-western Nile Delta. The information collected is archaeological (pottery and maps), geological (positions of river branches) and historical (place names, historical events). The preliminary results of the survey have shown that in the western delta sites towns and villages seem to have been abandoned in the 7th century AD, whereas in the northern delta they were abandoned in the 10th century AD. Part of the reason for this difference may be that the river branch in the west silted up so that towns depending upon it for water and communications could not continue in existence. In the north the river branches continued later and dried up in the 10th century AD. The aricle examines all of the evidence including accounts of famine and plagues in the Islamic period to account for the abandonment of the towns and changes in settlement patterns.\nBoth articles have similar themes but they are applied in detail at Sais over a long period of time, and over a wider area in the north-west Delta for a shorter time span.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F00205X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
