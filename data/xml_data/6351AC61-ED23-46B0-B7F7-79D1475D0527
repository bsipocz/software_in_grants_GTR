broadly themed questions sent out by the MOA, three times a year. Writers' responses to these directives provide a personal account of individuals' activities and attitudes towards a broad range of issues relating to British society. This writing has the potential to be of interest to wide audiences including, academics, policy-makers, practitioners, lay researchers, community groups, schools, adult education groups and individuals. 

However, for some time there has been a debate about the 'representativeness' of MOP writers. The MOA undertook some basic analyses of its writers, finding that at certain points in the lifetime of the MOP, writers have been over-represented by women living in the South East aged 50+. Some academics have used this finding to argue that MOP writers are not representative of the broader UK population, and their writing should not be used for research purposes. Others argue that the depth and quality of MOP writing makes it a unique longitudinal resource that can be used by researchers from different disciplinary fields. The debate has impacted on the trust and use of the MOP. This project seeks to put an end to this debate by producing sophisticated analyses of MOP writers that provide clear, evidence-based descriptions of writers and their socio-economic characteristics. This will enable all users of the archive to be confident about how and why they use this resource.

The MOA, who are our partners in this project, have not had the tools and skills to do these sorts of analyses. During recent work on another project involving use of MOP writing, we discovered that the MOA hold lots of information on MOP writers. This includes information about their age, gender, occupation, which directives they have responded to, and how long these responses are. In its current form, this information can't be analysed. But, in collaboration with the MOA, we have developed a plan to integrate this information into one searchable database, to conduct a series of analyses to find out more about MOP writers. We will ask how the characteristics of MOP writers compare with those of the UK population as a whole; how they compare with those of the UK population that engage in active volunteering; and what their writing behaviour can tells us, for example, do women respond to different directives to men? 

As well as looking at this statistical information, we will look at MOP writing in response to the 1990 directive entitled Social Divisions, which 652 writers responded to (this represents 75% of active/serial responding writers). Writers talk about what class they think they are, whether they belong to a minority group, and whether they discriminate against others that are different. This will enable us to understand how writers perceive themselves, and how they fit with the broader UK population. We will also look at the 2008 Directive Your Lifeline, where 159 writers discussed meaningful life events. This will allow us to see, for example, when in their life-course they decided to write for the MOP, and whether they share particular life events, such as bereavement, divorce, or children leaving home. Using computer software, we will combine the statistical information with the MOP writing, and conduct an additional in depth analysis of these 811 individuals

Our end-products will include the launch of an interactive searchable database, maintained by the MOA, enabling archive users to undertake a wide variety of searches of writer characteristics and responses to different directives; and publication of accessible reports, articles and conference papers, describing MOP writers to lay and academic audiences. These outputs will widen access to and enable confident use of the archive.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Mass Observation Project's (MOP) rich archival collections are a vital and significant research resource. Our work will contribute to bringing them to wider attention, and it will open up access to the material held at the Mass Observation Archive (MOA). Beneficiaries of this project are therefore likely to include not just policy-makers, but a much wider audience that includes practitioners, individual lay researchers, community groups, schools, adult education groups, and individuals. 
 
The main beneficiaries from the work will be:
1. Our project partners: 
a) The MOA staff: The skills of the staff working on the project will be enhanced in the short term through developing expertise about the use of the demographic and socioeconomic metadata held by MOA. We also envisage that they will gain skills and experience through playing lead roles in managing and co-producing knowledge for the proposed project. This academic and practical experience and knowledge will help the MOA staff as a group to develop their skills, and stand them in good stead in the wider job market in the longer term.
b) The MOA organisation: a longer term benefit to the archive will be the increase of electronic data within its archive; and its recognition of the increasing role of technology in the curating of archival materials. Embracing the future uses of technology, particularly in relation to electronic access, will enable MOA to widen its user-group, strengthen its position as an archive, and strengthen its links to other archives. 
2. Third and private sector research and consultancy agencies / think tanks: the new economics foundation, NESTA, the RSA, Demos, Civitas, the Centre for Social Justice, the Young Foundation, and ResPublica. All of these have interests in the relationship between public policy and public opinion, and MOA's material provides a unique perspective on how individuals have responded to changed socioeconomic and political circumstances. Understanding who MOP writers are, will enable confident use of the MOP as a source of secondary data.
3. Users in the wider social research community, particularly organisations concerned with researching trends in public opinion. As a result of our work, they will be able, with care, to draw comparisons between the patterns of responses from their own surveys, and those revealed by the qualitative material gathered by the MOP.
4. Government departments, who might reasonably be expected to have a concern with changing patterns of public opinion. The on-line thinktank, History and Policy, has in recent years done much to draw the attention of policy-makers to the rich range of material that provides historical perspective on policy debates, and they have encountered a receptive audience. 
5. Individual lay researchers and adult education groups, many of whom have a focus on or interests in archival material; as is the case with other beneficiaries, they will benefit from improved access to the material, and from better information enabling them to contextualize it. 
6. Building capacity within the archive for the MOA to digitise its holdings, and make these available online. In the longer-term the MOA's reach could extend to new, non-traditional users of the archive, particularly people and groups who cannot afford to travel to visit the MOA, and those living in geographically remote areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154620</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mass Observation Archive</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership working with the Mass Observation Archive</gtr:description><gtr:id>44FCB63E-3967-42C1-96F6-8F466ADBDD24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>December 2014, starting work on successful SDAI phase 2 project 'Defining Metadata'

The database enables users of the archive to find out more about individual MOP writers, their demographic characteristics, and their writing behaviours. An additional tool within the database enables users to make simple comparisons between the demographic characteristics of writers and those of the broader UK population (based on census data). This initiative makes the MOP writing panel a knowable resource and should encourage more confident use of the archive. 

The database enables potential users to ask specific questions of the archive and its materials; quickly and remotely understand the nature of the MOP resource and the individual writers that make up the panel; and understand how writers compare to the broader UK population. It also enables users to gain a sense of the relevance of the MOP to their interests and research. The database has opened up access to the MOP archive and should encourage more users, including academics, third sector researchers, individual lay users, community groups and schools. 

We used a variety of different media to advertise the database. Figures for the first four months of use, July to October 2016, show that the database was accessed on average by 350 different users each month, with an average of 1200 visits per month during this time. 

The database is a sustainable resource. The MOA is in the process of regularly inputting new information on writers and their responses to new directives. The database has been designed in a way that new categories of data can be added to it, should the Mass Observation Archive (MOA) begin to collect additional new data about writers. 
There are several impacts that we can report in relation to the impact of this project on the MOA and its staff. i) Firstly, throughout the lifetime of this project - during the bid-writing process, whilst work on data cleaning, analysis, and collation, and during the building of the database - staff at the MOA have been very involved in this project. This has enabled them to consider the value of their metadata to users and potential users of the archive, to identify how this metadata might be used, and gain understanding of the relationship between metadata and sampling. The MOA asked a small number of users to trial the database before its launch, and provide feedback. This has enabled further insights into the value of the data to MOP users. ii) Secondly, MOA staff have learnt how metadata collection methods and curation can affect the quality of that data; for example, ensuring the use of consistent descriptors of demographic characteristics ; and ensuring that data collected over different time-points is saved. This learning will affect collection and curation policies in the future. iii) Since the project funding came to an end, the MOA have been considering whether they should be collecting additional data and are currently in consultation with previous commissioners. The academic members of the team have suggested that the MOA should begin to collect data on the ethnicity of its writing panel, and the MOA staff and trustees are in the process of considering whether to implement this suggestion.

Additional impacts have been reported by the MOA staff. The database is used by staff in teaching sessions at The Keep, promoting the research opportunities offered by the archive to undergraduate and postgraduate students. The MOA Education and Outreach Officer has been promoting and using the resource with secondary school and community groups. Staff at the MOA report that the database is a very tangible and accessible tool which has saved them time when preparing for teaching activities, enabling them to identify resources and writing more quickly and easily. It has also enabled them to showcase the archive's longitudinal opportunities during teaching, demonstrating how users of the archive can follow writers through time. Staff report a step-change in the way the archive is being considered and used, enabling more complex understandings of the resource which are both thematic and longitudinal.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>225A0ED1-30C2-4692-ACF1-4906A9B78975</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c205a3a9a974.13798594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Since 1981, the Mass Observation Project (MOP) has been a unique source of public opinion on a wide range of social, economic and political issues. More than 3,500 self-selected volunteer writers have contributed to the MOP. However, aside from simple analyses undertaken by the Mass Observation Archive (MOA), there has been little available information about the demographic make-up of this panel of writers. Archive-users have needed to read writers' responses to directives (sets of themed questions) to obtain this data. Because of these limitations, debates within the social sciences have questioned the reliability utility of the MOP data on the grounds that the panel is unrepresentative of the broader British population. One of the key aims of the 'Defining Mass Observation' study was to increase user-confidence in the reliability of the MOP, by providing data that made MOP writers a knowable sample. 

We collated and classified previously unused qualitative and quantitative material supplied by writers, to provide accurate socio-economic data on writer characteristics. Analysing the panel as a whole, we found an over-representation of women, middle-class socioeconomic groups, and middle-aged and older age groups, amongst MOP writers. Data on ethnicity is missing. When considered as a panel, our analysis shows that these writers are, as previously argued, an unrepresentative subset of the population. However, this finding is offset by the study's creation of a searchable, sustainable online database: http://database.massobs.org.uk/projects_database/mass_observation/. This provides information on the socio-demographic characteristics of individual writers, such as age, gender, marital status, place of residence, and ONS Standard Occupation Classifications (measures of socio-economic status based on occupation). It offers tools to enable users to make simple comparisons between writers and the broader UK population. It also gives information on individual writing behaviours, such as when individual writers joined the MOP, and which directives they have responded to. Database users can carry out a variety of different searches based on these data; for example, it is possible to identify and sample writers sharing particular characteristics who have written on specific themes. The database, which was launched in July 2016, will be regularly updated, and can be down-loaded as an Excel spreadsheet for use offline. 

The study also analysed writing on class and life histories, providing additional insights on writers; highlighting the relevance of MOP writing to academic debates on class; and identifying life-histories as a key resource for researchers seeking more information on writers. We also pioneered new ways of analysing MOP writing using computer assisted qualitative analysis (CAQDAS) tools. 

Further proposed work includes the development of a study that will gather data on writers' ethnicity, and recruit additional BME writers to the panel; and advice to the MOA to collect biographic data from the panel at different time-points to enable better longitudinal use of the archive. 

The perceived benefits of the study - greater confidence in the archive should be visible through the outputs of future academic and non-academic research drawing on MOP material</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our database and its tools have made MOP writers a knowable sample. They provide new and existing users of the archive with a secure platform from which to begin using MOP writing, enabling confident sampling of writers and writing. The database should open up opportunities for wider use of MOP writing, and we anticipate that this will include not just a more diverse group of academics from a range of different disciplines, but policy makers, practitioners, third sector organisations, educators and community groups. The database should also enable MOP users to see the longitudinal opportunities offered by the MOP archive, and the opportunities for using MOP writing with other mixed sources. Additionally, there is the capacity for the Mass Observation Archive to add to and build on the database in the future, creating further potential uses of the MOP. 
Our study has also concerned itself with methodologies that might be applied by MOP users. We have considered the potential opportunities offered by MOP material for analysis, and will be making this available to users of the archive. We have provided examples of ways in which MOP writing can be analysed using computer assisted qualitative analysis (CAQDAS) tools - making available sample CAQDAS projects for scrutiny by MOP users. We hope to spark methodological debate amongst MOP users, as well as kick-starting the take-up of CAQDAS tools for analysis. 
There is potential for the quantitative methods we have used to be taken forward in other contexts. For example, voluntary organisations are now concerned with how far their volunteers can be considered representative, and how far they are reaching their target clientele. The methods used here - comparisons with appropriate survey or census data - can be applied to other data held by organisations. Additionally, our consideration of the value of the debate on representativeness has the potential to provoke wider academic and practitioner debate. For example, when considering patterns of social inclusion or exclusion in volunteering, to what extent can and should individual organisations be expected to recruit groups of volunteers that are typical of the wider population?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>816EB18A-29F2-4F63-B387-C2881CFD53C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c2070e616845.54172378</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://database.massobs.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An online accessible database, that can be used by any one interested in finding out more about Mass Observation writers (1981 to present day) and their writing behaviours. 

The database brings together metadata relating to writers, that includes ONS Social Occupation Classification; where writers live; when they joined the Mass Observation Project (MOP), how often they have written for the MOP, what directives they have respondend. This database provides access to previously unused metadata that should enable confident sampling of the writers, by demographic characterstics, length of time involved with the archive, or writing behaviour

The data has been analysed to provide users with a brief overview of Mass Observation writers compare to the broader representative UK population, and the UK volunteering population.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E414E1C7-C7EF-4816-A45E-BD8D43506C7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since its launch in July 2016, the database has been well used, showing there is an appetite for this information.

We would expect to see an increase in the number of people using the Mass Observation Project longitudinally and as part of mixed methods projects, although it would be difficut to directly evidence a correlation between this increase and use of the database.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cdb3a9ef3055.63827287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>New Mass Observation Archive database for writers writing from 1981 onwards</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://database.massobs.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This project has broken new ground in the use of Mass Observation Archive data - this is the first time that a group of individual Mass Observation Project writers (1981-2014) have been followed across time</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2EB793C-AF06-4231-BBE9-127DF2760571</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have presented this research innovation to conferences. We also blogged about our longitudinal use of the Mass Observation Project. This has raised awareness that the archive could be used in this way. Several researchers have demonstrated interest in taking up this approach, and we have been informed of several individuals who have applied for funding using this approach, subsequently, as a result of our initiative. In April 2012 we submitted our funding bid to the ESRC and presented at the July 2012 Mass Observation Conference, where we had several discussions with individuals who were interersted in the longitudinal opportunities offered by the Mass Observation project. We had a long discussion with the historian James Hinton, botjh about the longitudinal opportunities of MOP and how to use MOP metadata to follow individual writers, This researcher has gone on to use the Mass Observation Archive to follow individual writers and explore their life-courses. He has subsequently published a longitudinal piece on 7 Mass Observers. 

We presented on this research at the Research Methods Festival in July 2014; and we ran a training workshop on longitudinal and mixed-method use of Mass Observation in October 2014. Some of those who attended the Research Methods Festival presentation also attended the training workshop. Workshop attendees included undergraduates, post-graduates, ECRs and established researchers. Feedback was very positive, with researchers very interested in pursuing longitudinal use of Mass Observation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54608aa785fa83.76520985</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Using Mass Observation Archive data longitudinally and as part of a mixed-methods project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Dr Christina Silver has led on identifying ways of using CAQDAS tools to undertake longitudinal analysis of Mass Observation scripts.
