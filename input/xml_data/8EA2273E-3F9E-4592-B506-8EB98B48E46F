The Greater East Asian Film Sphere and the legacy of colonial cinema.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J001120/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Japanese Colonial Empire is unique as one of the only non-Western Empires of modern times (Peattie &amp;amp; Myers, 1984:6) and began with the cession of Taiwan in 1895. Rapidly the Empire expanded to include Karafuto (colonized 1905), Korea (1910), German Micronesia (1914) and Manchuria (1931). Japan's initially success in the Pacific War would also see Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore and British Malaya come under Japanese rule. The Japanese Empire was marked by two key (and often conflicting) discourses. The first was one that focused on the cultural and historical 'sameness' of people in Asia and presented the unity of Asia as a positive and necessary process to defend against Western Imperialism. The 'Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere' would unite all Asians under Japanese leadership in order to enter into the modern global experience. However, this paternalistic vision of Japan leading East Asia to a bright future was in contrast to the strongly held Imperial discourse that offered a clear notion of Japanese superiority and therefore, difference from the rest of the peoples and cultures of East Asia. This conflict between the ideals of a Pan-Asia and the focus on Japan as different and superior resulted in continual conflict between the colonizing Government and the local population that was often brutally repressed. 'The Greater East Asian Film Sphere' (GEAFS) was a term that came into existence around 1941. Linked into the Japanese Imperialist idea of 'united' Asia the GEAFS was part of the pan-Asianist movement that the Japanese Empire officially promoted. The GEAFS was never fully defined by the Japanese colonial units and, as such, is one of the forgotten and under-examined elements of the Japanese colonial machine. \nThe notion, however, of a pan-Asian film ideology has survived and with the ever-increasing focus on Asian co-productions as the method to resist Hollywood domination, elements of the ideology of the GEAFS can be seen as still existing. The increasing influence of East Asian Cinema on the global stage has been enhanced by the increasing cooperation between the nations to present a united and sustainable East Asian Film Industry that transcends national boundaries (one of the key aims of the GEAFS). This project will focus on four main areas. The first is how can the GEAFS be defined? This first section will examine the theories and construction of the Japanese Empire and how visual elements such as film, animation and newsreels, played an important role in the dissemination of the ideals. The second area of study examines how the Japanese colonial government sought to implement these ideas in the various states that Japan occupied 1941-1945. This project will offer an overview of all aspects of the colonial Empire as it related to Visual Culture but will focus specifically on Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, Manchuria and Taiwan. These regions reflect the whole spectrum of Japanese colonial states from those that had been part of the Empire in the early stages to later acquisitions. Whilst there is not a vast amount of primary material available from this period (due to lack of early conservation efforts and the various conflicts that have affected the respective regions since 1945), there are enough available primary sources (available via archives in all the respective countries) from these regions to make a well-supported and informed study of this period. The Japanese Empire was not a monolithic entity and the third section of the project will focus on examining how the GEAFS interact with colonial constructions and discourses in the specific states and focus on the differences and similarities that exist between them. The final element of this project will focus on the legacy of GEAFS in the modern day East Asian Film Industry. This project will examine how the present day East Asian Media Networks are highly indebted to the GEAFS and the foundations established in this period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project includes two workshops aimed at students and those in the local community and builds on my previous successful collaborations with School and Community projects. These collaborations have included the Life Long Learning 'World Cinema Course' (Bangor University, 2007), 'Japanese Cinema for Beginners' (The Pheonix, Exeter 2003), 'French Film and Culture' (Soka Community Centre, Tokyo, 2002) and several cinema education sessions at Theater Gwynedd, Bangor (2007-2008). \nWorkshop One: The first workshop will take place at Eirias High School (Colwyn Bay, Wales) and will engage with the students (age 14-16) as part of the G.C.S.E. History curriculum. This links in directly with the special topic areas that are studied in Key Stage 4 (G.C.S.E) History at Eirias: Germany 1918-1939 and the Cold War 1943-1991. The workshop will focus on examining the issues related to propaganda and will be built around the main questions: What is propaganda? What examples can you give? How do you respond to propaganda? Do you think that it is an effective method of communication? \nThis workshop will engage with one of the key mission statements of the school, which is to provide a 'life-long love of learning'. This workshop is designed to encourage students to link the academic studies into the wider media world in which they all reside, and to help them to understand that an examination of the past can lead to a more in-dept understanding of the contemporary world. \nThis workshop builds on previous school-level workshops (looking at various aspects of film and media) I have held as part of a local program (TOPS) to encourage local student to enter into higher education. For the workshops I will create specifically designed dossiers of materials to be handed out to the students and involved staff members. These will include readings, images and sites for further information. This will ensure that these projects resources will be utilized after the life span of this project. \nWorkshop Two: This workshop will engage with members of the local community. I have previously run highly successful workshops on aspects of Cinema at the Phoenix Media Centre Exeter, Soka Community Center and Theatre Gwynedd, Bangor and this workshop will build on those experiences. It will also link into my previous Lifelong-learning module 'World Cinemas' which I taught as part of Bangor University's successful Lifelong Learning department. These prior workshops have allowed me to develop the skills to conduct workshops that ensure that all attendees, regardless of background and previous experience, learn in a safe and supportive and enjoyable environment. \nThe proposed 15 person half-day workshop will be free and will engage with presenting a stimulating and interactive introduction to Japanese Visual Culture of the Second World War. This workshop will be directly using information and visual artefacts related to this project. This workshop will be held at the School of Creative Studies and Media since this will allow for direct links between the local community and the school to be enhanced and will provide a forum for the community to engage in the study of film. Undergraduate and postgraduate students at the school will also be encourage to attend since this has been proved to be a success in the past workshops since students often benefit from the diverse historical and cultural knowledge which interested community members often bring to such events. Previous workshops have proven to be highly successful and popular with local community members who often attend since they are interested in an area of film that they have had little or no prior contact with.Given the bilingual policy of Bangor University, these workshops will be conducted in Welsh and English utilizing the university's well-established simultaneous translation unit.

Linked into the Japanese Imperialist idea of 'the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity sphere', the GEAFS was part of a pan-Asianist moment that was at the heart of the Japanese theorization (and justification) of their Imperial narrative. Divine Work (Seigy&amp;otilde;) was the term that was used to describe the Imperial Project and it is from this term that this monograph takes its title. Central to this monograph is the difficult question of what was the GEAFS and how was the GEAFS implemented and theorized by those in power from the late 1930s to the end of the Pacific War (1945). The GEAFS was never fully defined by the Japanese government and colonial units and, as such, is one of the forgotten and under-examined elements of the Japanese colonial machine. The notion, however, of a pan-Asian film ideology has survived and with the ever-increasing focus on Asian co-productions as a method of resisting Hollywood domination, the ideology of the GEAFS as related to East Asian co-operation and co-production can still be seen to exist despite the removal of the links to Japanese Imperialism. 
Hobsbawm reminds us of the continual need to examine the age of Empire since although 'we are not longer in it', we 'do not know how much of it is still in us' (1989:5). Although the Japanese Empire may have ended over 70 years ago, its legacy lives on in many aspects of East Asian society, culture, politics and government and a continual examination of the colonial period is needed to fully comprehend modern politics and cultural trends in the region. Intra-East Asian politics and cultural engagements are still steeped in the language and the often-unresolved questions related to the colonial period. Events such the China/Japan oil disputes or the controversial text book reform movement can be seen as directly linking back to the events of the 1930s and 1940s. In terms of visual culture: film (e.g. 2002 Lost Memories (2009), Lust Caution (2010) and Modern Boy (2008)], manga (e.g On Taiwan, Yoshinori (2001), Truth of War, Mizuki (2008)], art and photography (personified by artists such as Shimamoto Shozo and Ando Yasuhiko), are all methods through which debates and assessment of the colonial and war period have been sustained. The face of modern East Asia has its roots clearly in the colonial period. In the West however the examination of the Japanese Colonial Empire, when compared to its European counterparts, has been extremely limited. While studies such as Myers and Pettries (1987), Shin &amp;amp; Robinson (2001), Barlow (1997) and Ruoff (2009) have offered an excellent overview of many aspects of the Japanese Colonial Machine. Examination of visual culture (film in particular) has remained neglected. Unlike French, British or even Italian cinema and visual culture, the Japanese colonial cinema machine has, although more studies are emerging in the last couple of years, remained in the background. 
This project has discovered that the cinema from this period was far more complex and innovative then previously thought. The project engaged with hitherto little, or previously never seen, archival footage, and has developed a clear understanding of the Imperial Cinema of this period from the former territories including Korea, China (Manchuria), Taiwan, the Philippines and Hong Kong. This project was successful in a series of ways:
(1) It was one of the first in-depth examinations of the GEAFS as a specific element of the wider discourses of Colonial cinema; 
(2) It allowed for an examination across the whole Empire rather than in discrete national contexts allowing for transnational patterns and narratives to be more clearly examined; 
(3) It fully evaluated the enduring legacy of the colonial cinema unit and how its ethos links into modern day transnational cinema units thereby extending and enhancing the debate on globalized and transnational Asian cinema.

This monograph study is under contract with Bloomsbury Press and is expected in publication in due course.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work can be taken forward in a variety of ways.

1: develop further the opportunity for more detailed examinations of the films, directors, stars and industrial of this period.
2: develop further debates on Imperialism, Colonialism and Post-Colonialism as it related to the territories designated 'East Asia' in the collective imagination.
3: explore greater depth how social and cultural dynamics such as race, gender, class and politics were articulated and sometimes even challenged in the cinema of this period.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E55E5F56-9490-4658-AF1F-501E58E3C709</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5433bbecb05120.17141270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8782A37B-EEAC-4465-9F94-FEA207EAFFF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Film Landscapes: Cinema, Environment and Visual Culture</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6e940fc981da703bed3e67e5c67d987f"><gtr:id>6e940fc981da703bed3e67e5c67d987f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor-Jones, Kate</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>1443843725</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5418579bf31919.85040100</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>89DB48A9-5B55-483C-9245-E3E45ADD8577</gtr:id><gtr:title>De-Westernizing Film Studies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff4e025ea91c70cfe7200164047f1360"><gtr:id>ff4e025ea91c70cfe7200164047f1360</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor-Jones</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-68784-3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-5903190780.3408713bb6e5d2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>00399FA6-A4FC-45AA-94C7-19068235CF36</gtr:id><gtr:title>Divine Work, Japanese Colonial Cinema and its Legacy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4698dbca81b563afad38900a3f3c5382"><gtr:id>4698dbca81b563afad38900a3f3c5382</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor-Jones Kate E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781501306129</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>541857d5d8c008.37661369</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7C5D943-2F45-47A4-B13E-771CA11CFB5F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Film Landscapes: Cinema, Environment and Visual Culture</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4fcd6268a283b627490fba157b9883a1"><gtr:id>4fcd6268a283b627490fba157b9883a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor-Jones, K.
