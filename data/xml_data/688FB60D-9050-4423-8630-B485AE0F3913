In the case of an SR machine the stationary component has a series of inward facing teeth which can individually be temporarily magnetised by 'switching on' electrical current through a coil wound round each tooth. The rotor also has teeth but fewer than the number of stator teeth. Thus, it rotates when one of its teeth is attracted to a magnetised stator tooth. Once the rotor tooth is aligned with the stator tooth, the current in the coil is 'switched off' and current in the adjacent stator tooth is' switched on'. This causes the rotor to rotate to align with the next tooth and so on. Continuous rotation is achieved by sequentially switching the stator coils on and off in the correct order. The SR machine principle has been employed for over 50 years. However, whilst the coil currents were originally switched on and off be mechanical switches, today's SR machines use semiconductor switches and advanced digital control to enable high performance to be achieved.The current which flows in the coils generates waste heat, much like the electric current in an electric fire heats up the element, and the coils tend to get very hot. The maximum power capability of the machine is limited by the temperature of the coils which must be kept below a safe value. In the past, motor designers have used a range of techniques to remove the heat from the coils and prevent overheating. These include blowing air through the machine with an internal fan or using a water cooling jacket on the outside of the machine.In many cases, however, it is not possible to use such methods since they add weight and increase the volume, and the extra complexity means that the machine is more likely to fail. This project is aimed at looking at methods to pump cooling air through an SR machine and to direct it to the windings without the need for a fan. Since the rotor of an SR machine resembles a fan it can be used to create a large amount of air flow. When it rotates the air will tend to rotate with it, and as this happens the centrifugal force will throw the air outwards (much like clothes sticking to the inside of a washing machine drum). If the air is not vented out of the machine the centrifugal force creates a high pressure at the surface of the stator. If holes are drilled into the stator then this high pressure air will escape, and as it does so it can be directed over the windings and will cool them down. The hot air may then be vented into the atmosphere through the end-caps of the motor. To ensure a continuous air flow, inlet ports, which allow cold air into the motor, are drilled into the end-caps below the exhaust vents. Potentially, an SR machine can pump a lot of air, and if care is not taken when designing the air ducts and vents this air-pumping can absorb a lot of power and the efficiency of the machine will be reduced. The aim of the project is to use computer simulations to predict the air flow in an SR machine to predict the amount of air that flows through the machine. The simulations will be used to design specific features of the machine, i.e. the ports and ducts, etc, to make sure the maximum amount of air is blown over the winding to achieve the highest level of cooling. With the improved cooling SR machines will be able to deliver more power before the windings overheat, and can be exploited in a new range of high-power density, low space-envelope applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114203</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D060672/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5CBA14F4-F235-45B6-A9DD-5937D5C166CC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8EA34BFB-4EB0-4972-B5C3-EEF9D07ED9EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electric Motor &amp; Drive Systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93295214-E29B-49B2-AA54-09445C36CAF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heat &amp; Mass Transfer</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
