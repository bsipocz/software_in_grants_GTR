We want to do the work because we believe the skills learned during debating, such as objective critical evaluation, are very valuable in developing scientifically literate and engaged citizens - as well as being useful in everyday life. Young people will play a huge part in their own learning experience. Teachers have told us that when their pupils have to make a case, they really have to understand the material, so debating becomes a valuable tool. It also takes pupils out of the world of theory to look at applications. Debating helps develop a wide range of skills - research, building coherent arguments, public speaking, listening and evaluation, and collaborative learning. It is also a fun way to explore science.
As well as equipping young people with debating skills, we want to help them understand how to question and weigh up evidence to make informed choices. These are skills which universities and future employers value highly, and which will increase the life opportunities of the young people who take part.

Through the STEM Ambassadors programme, and our other university contacts, pupils will have an opportunity to question scientists from industry and academia, fostering wider links and encouraging young people to consider science as a career. The project fits well with the new Scottish Curriculum for Excellence, which sees a more interdisciplinary approach to learning plus a responsibility for literacy within the science classroom; and improved professional development for STEM teachers. As explained elsewhere in this application, we will seek to engage schools in outlying areas, which may not usually (for reasons of cost and distance) be able to take part in such a science programme. 

The topic area we want to address is Nuclear Energy. This was the most frequently asked for resource in the feedback from our project last year (see below). We'll look at how it sits alongside renewables as an energy source; and issues of waste and reprocessing. We hope to put practical, and applied, flesh on the bones of the work pupils will be doing on radioactivity and nuclear reactions. 
This resource will be in the form of 'fact sheets' (printed class sets) alongside teachers' notes/lesson plan. Both will also be freely available to download from our website. 

This is the extension of a project begun last year, with funding from the Scottish Government, The Robertson Trust and The MacRobert Trust. We were able to:
- create a debates handbook for science teachers, and a website (www.speakupscotland.org.uk). Our existing topics include particle physics (CERN) and space research (eg Hubble's law); nanotechnology and renewable energy. All our materials are freely available to download. 
- run debating workshops for science teachers 
- organise scientist visits to schools (through the STEM Ambassadors programme);
- set up a national science debating competition. 

We have worked hard to make the contacts with schools and the scientific community, and we have learned a huge amount along the way, so we think we're now able to offer even better workshops and support. We know there is a big demand for the project to continue. 
Last year, over 430 science teachers in 137 schools took part in the debating workshops . These have been consistently highly rated by teachers: 97% rated them as excellent or good (excellent: 63%). What came across most in the feedback was that teachers found it useful doing the activities themselves, and they liked the range of debating formats as it enabled them to incorporate debating into their own lessons more easily. 

We are now seeking funding to help us continue the project: to run a more detailed workshop programme for teachers and pupils, create new science resources and continue to encourage discussion between scientists and young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>All resources will be freely available to schools and the wider public on the Speak Up Scotland website. We will also provide printed class sets of the Nuclear Energy resources, as we're conscious that schools end up spending huge amounts of money photocopying resources if these are only available online. These can be laminated and used repeatedly. 
Information about the project will be distributed to STEM networks, who will put details of the project on their websites with links to our resources. Working with the STEM contract holders, also enables us to discuss the project with the Science Ambassadors community. 
The Debates DVD will be given to participating schools, and we will provide it in clip form on the website, so any educator can easily view it.
We will also make it available on You Tube. 

The workshops will be showcased through Scottish Schools Education Resource Centre (SSERC) where we have been invited to run taster workshops for science teachers on residential courses. 
Suzanne is regularly asked to run workshops for PGDE students - eg through Aberdeen University, where we already have good links. These are opportunities to show tomorrow's educators how the ideas can work. 

There are a number of other opportunities: 
National Science Week 2013: we will discuss our participation with Education Scotland. One idea is to organise a mini debate on nuclear energy. 

Working with Martin Hendry, we also anticipate showcasing the workshop as part of the Glasgow Science Festival in June 2013 and the Orkney International Science Festival in September 2013, as well as various other schools events in the West of Scotland organised in collaboration with the British Science Association.
We are discussing with the organisers of the Edinburgh International Science festival, who are keen supporters of the project, how we might communicate successful ideas and run a taster session during the Edinburgh International Science Festival in April 2013. 
These events will also allow us to communicate our work to a wider public audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9860</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CPD Workshops for Science Teachers- Debating in the Science Classroom</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8292F508-A078-4835-BF5E-36C307994FF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We delivered 6 regional half-day workshops for science teachers. These were held at various locations across Scotland, and attended by teachers from a number of schools in the region. We held workshops in the following locations: Dumfries &amp;amp; Galloway; Edinburgh; The Scottish Borders (2 workshops); Aberdeen (Aberdeen University PGDE Science course); SSERC (Scottish Schools Education Research Centre) Leadership Course, SSERC Chemistry Course. In total, 82 teachers from 75 schools attended a workshop. In addition, we also delivered a workshop specifically for teachers at Whitburn Academy.
 
 These workshops were based on the topic of nuclear energy and introduced different debating techniques to get the pupils talking and arguing about the topic. The workshops were very practical, taking teachers step by step through the activities and in every workshop teachers participated in a debate about nuclear power that they could then replicate with their classes. We also provided all teachers with resource packs and online materials, and a resource about nuclear power specifically produced for this project and funded by this award. 


The workshops enabled the teachers to go on and hold debates with their pupils during classes. A number of teachers who had attended workshops then requested that we deliver follow-up pupil workshops at their schools.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532c8aa3326395.18921704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.speakupscotland.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Podcast on Nuclear Fusion</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02ECB731-FA0A-44D1-AC30-728C165514BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Online video podcast to enable pupils to learn about fusion research. This podcast is by one of the world's experts, Professor Steve Cowley from the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. 



This podcast has been very positively received. Pupils and teachers have been enthused by the ideas and images; and when it was shown during the workshops it spurred questions to visiting scientists. It has also convinced one pupil we spoke to that this was the area of research he wanted to become involved in.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532c97e55fbe82.40231335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.speakupscotland.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pupil Debating Workshops and visits from STEM Ambassadors</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D8D0DCB-9AEC-49A2-9B94-FEC991577E58</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These pupil workshops provided debates activities and training for the pupils, utilising the skills that teachers had learnt at the CPD sessions, combined with the chance for pupils to speak to a scientist who visited the school, arranged through the STEM Ambassadors programme, and our network of contacts.

During the workshops we looked at a variety of debating skills and activities, such as weighing evidence, building arguments, planning speeches, as well as delivering speeches during the debate. At every workshop a STEM Ambassador working in the field of nuclear energy, and sometimes a second scientist working in renewables, was there to speak to pupils and answer questions relating to the pupils' research for the debate. In every workshop the pupils participated in a debate of some kind.

 We have delivered pupil workshops at:
 Whitburn Academy, West Lothian (two workshops)
 Broughton High School, Edinburgh
 Williamwood High School, East Renfrewshire
 Jedburgh Grammar School, The Scottish Borders
 St Margaret Mary's Secondary School, Glasgow

We are now dealing with requests for additional pupil workshops and requests for additional scientist visits. 
 
Nuclear energy will form the main plank of our Schools public speaking competition in May/June 2014.

The pupils got a great deal out of these workshops. Teachers have told us that it helped pupils to look at the topic from different points of view, and many pupils ended up changing their opinions on the topic during the process. In addition to helping the pupils with their research, these discussions also opened up the idea of a career in science, and questions ranged from &amp;quot;How efficient are nuclear power stations? to &amp;quot;What is the best thing about being a scientist?&amp;quot; We were very fortunate to have experts in their field visiting the schools, so the teachers also benefitted as they were able to bring their scientific knowledge up to date. The debating activities enabled them to put into practice and consolidate their knowledge of classroom debating.
 
 By the end of the workshops all the pupils were better informed on the topic and more confident in expressing their ideas.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532c8f6e27a7c7.40364208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.speakupscotland.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>How-to Science Debating DVD</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D08A1EB7-3217-4812-B9FC-D725FE8EAA3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Step by step guide to debating, as requested by teachers across the country. It is available on DVD and sections can be downloaded from the website. The DVD includes a series of presentations; demonstrations of debating activities in a real classroom setting; insights into the preparation process and a full scale debate about nuclear energy involving the entire class. We worked with Whitburn Academy to produce this as part of our CPD and workshop activities with them and it shows teachers what can be achieved in a just a few lessons. 


Teachers have told us it demonstrates that debating can be done - and done well- in the science classroom; and that all pupils can be involved. Feedback from the school which took part, was extremely positive- both from pupils and teachers. The pupils and teachers involved in making this DVD grew in confidence enormously throughout the process. We have provided DVDs to partcipating schools at all workshops. The sections online are available to all teachers and pupils, not just those participating in the programme, and we hope this will create a wider audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532c98500339a5.97803103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.speakupscotland.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nuclear Energy Teaching Resource and Pupil factsheet</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A35D77FD-AC5C-4425-850B-454F38B6CB97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is both a teacher and pupil resource. It included a 'fact sheet' and pointers for additional research; suggestions for speech structure; a full and detailed lesson plan for teachers; and a brainstorming aid of nuclear pros and cons. We have used this as the main resource at both teacher and pupil workshops, and we also provided this resource to all schools competing in the third round of our National Juniors' Debating Competition (outside the project). The resource is available online to download from our website.



This resource has been a very useful reference tool. It provided pupils with a starting point for researching and building their arguments. It was used by all pupils as they worked in groups to develop arguments during the pupil workshops. This topic was the most requested topic from the first year of our programme and so it developed and built on our previous resources.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532c97a4348eb0.31713722</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Paper Presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.speakupscotland.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/K006053/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
