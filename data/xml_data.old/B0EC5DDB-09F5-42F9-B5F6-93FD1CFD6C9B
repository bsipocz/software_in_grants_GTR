Despite the societal implications of this phenomenon, we know little about the health interventions and policies that could encourage workers to stay longer in work, as well as the economic costs of these interventions. This project aims to identify the policies and interventions that can help workers maintain employment by either diminishing the negative consequences of health problems or by improving the overall health of workers. In turn, the project also examines the impact of employment and retirement policies on maintaining good health. The project focuses on workplace interventions, health promotion programmes, and legislation and policies that support workers with health problems to remain in paid employment; and policies to prevent the development or aggravation of health problems. The project also studies the cost-effectiveness of interventions and policies for prolonging working lives in different social groups. The project will provide key evidence on the consequences of national policies on prolonging working careers and on the health of the workforce. It will also demonstrate the potential benefits of workplace and health interventions on the length of employment and worker's health.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary target population that will benefit from the project are older workers, who have a chronic health problem that may affect their ability to enter and maintain paid employment throughout their work career. It is estimated that within the European union approximately 25% of workers suffer from a longstanding problem which restricts their daily activities, i.e. about 30 million in the European union. The main causes of longstanding health problems in the working age population are chronic diseases, such as musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and mental, nervous or emotional problems [28]. The European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being has estimated that up to 10% of the European population will experience some type of depressive or anxiety related disorder every year, with women much more at risk than men. The estimated annual costs of depression in the workforce in the European Economic Area were approximately 100 billion Euro due to productivity losses from employment [29]. For other comparable diseases cost of illness studies have been published. These figures demonstrate that the target population is large and that the social and economic consequences of chronic disease are of paramount importance to the health and wealth of the working population.

Our research will contribute directly to current and evolving governmental policies on employment and retirement by providing sound evidence for impact on the length of employment and health. This will be achieved in several ways: First, our study will provide evidence of how health and employment interact to influence the likelihood of extended working careers, and will elucidate some of the pathways that connect employment and health among older workers. Understanding these mechanisms will be crucial for the development of interventions and policies that may be effective in extending working lives. Second, recent years have witnessed many policy reforms in European countries, particularly related to retirement ages and pension systems. However, little is known about the potential impact of these reforms for the health of workers and their ability to have extended working lives. Our study will provide key evidence of how these policies may have both intended, but also unintended consequences on worker's health and their ability to work longer. Finally, policy makers will benefit from the project by obtaining information on the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefits assessment of the multiple interventions and policy measures for a sustainable and inclusive workforce. This tool will enable policy makers to make evidence-based decisions that are expected to lead to better employment and health outcomes, and ultimately increase productivity and population health and well-being.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>193356</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Umea University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>EMC-NL &amp;amp; UU-SE</gtr:description><gtr:id>E90C17ED-6D1A-4717-BBE9-50D64044F5AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is in its first year so there are no concrete outputs yet; outputs are expected during the second year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c5a1373d3e39.48936132-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Both Erasmus and Umea University teams are providing intellectual inputs on the research design of our current main research focus, as well as substantial expertise on health variables and health indices adopted to identify specific health consequences of postponing the Statutory Pension Age in the UK.

However, we have carried out several activities to ensure our work benefits several groups outside of academia: First, we will present project results at the Conference &amp;quot;Global ageing: Challenges and Opportunities&amp;quot; organised by the Royal Society of Medicine in London, 23-25 April 2017 (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/sshm/eventsrecords/2017/Global-Ageing-challenges-and-opportunities.aspx), where we hope to reach clinical practitioners and policy makers. Second, we have presented the first results of the project at the KCL/LSE ALPHA Seminar Series jointly organised by the London School of Economics and the King's College in December 2016, which is open to the public and policy makers. On the 30th of March 2017, we will present the project at an event organised by the ESRC and the Centre for Ageing Better along with other projects on related topics in London, involving NGO's and policy makers. Finally a paper arising from our research is also accepted for presentation at the 2017 Congress of the International Health Economics Association in Boston, United States, taking place on 7-11 July 2017.

To ensure that we engage with key stakeholders from the outset, we have now formed an Impact Advisory Group led by the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. This group will meet in the mid-term of the project, and will include representatives from several international organisations who have now accepted to participate. Members include Prof. Lars L Andersen (Aalborg University, Denmark), Prof M. Lindeboom (VU University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Greet Vermeylen (Working Conditions and Industrial Relations -WCIR, Eurofound) and Manuel Flores (OECD). We will elicit the group's views of how results of the project can be best summarized, presented and disseminated via stakeholders' channels of communication. We have also created a website with key information on the project. We benefit from long-standing relationships of Erasmus MC with the EU Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SCANCO) and the EU Director General on Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG Employment).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B2E932B3-38EA-4978-AF69-0D8FA34AAD12</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c672838e3a79.62719691</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project examines how changes in retirement policies that extend working lives impact the health status of the UK and European population. After documenting how the Statutory Pension Age has been raised in several countries during the last decade, we focused on the major reform that came into place in the United Kingdom, where the SPA for the female population has been gradually rising for women born after April 1950. Because of how the reform has been designed, otherwise-similar cohorts are subject to very different pensionable ages: e.g., those born in early-1950 reach the pensionable age when turning 60 (in 2010), while the SPA for those born in mid-1953 is roughly 64 years (i.e., in 2017): in other words, those aged 60 in 2013 face a postponement of 4 years in SPA with respect to the pre-reform scenario. 

Our analysis focuses on the health effects of having to substantially delay retirement by exploiting the Understanding Society survey (waves 1-6). We augmented these data by generating a new individual-level variable for the SPA, based on the combination of the date-of-birth and the date-of-interview. Our attention lies on both mental-health (measured by the SF-12-mental index and the General Health Questionnaire) and physical-health (measured by the SF-12-physical) outcomes. 

Our preliminary results indicate that, as expected, having a state pension age higher than 60 substantially influenced the employment status of women, by significantly lowering their probability of reporting to be retired at the age of 60 or 61. Nonetheless, we show that several pathways out-of-employment emerge among the same age groups, with a significant increase in the transitions towards disability status or home/caregiving activities. This result will be further investigated, with respect to both the provision and the utilisation of informal-care by the population affected by the reform.

We then empirically compare the health status of women born slightly before and after 1950, of the same age at the time of the interview, but interviewed before, rather than after, the implementation of the reform. After controlling for age and year effects, as well as for a comprehensive set of socioeconomic variables, we find evidence of a detrimental effect on mental-health at 60, 61 or 62 for those women experiencing a postponement in the SPA (under both the SF-12 and the GHQ indices). Conversely, no result emerges for physical-health. Rather than highlighting a negative effect of working longer, this result, which is robust to various empirical specifications, may be interpreted as a short-term negative psychological effect of realising that more years of work are required in order to collect a pension. Our findings are in line with existing evidence suggesting that many women affected by the reform were unaware of their new SPA. Our research is now focusing on the heterogeneous effects across different socioeconomic groups and the impact of the reform on health inequalities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings offer two major insights to both Policy and Research in the areas of pensions and social care policies. First, understanding whether workers would spend the added years before retirement primarily in employment or in disability and home-caring would offer useful policy-insights in terms of understanding both labour force participation mechanisms, and the consequences for the demand and supply of informal-caregiving by 60+ individuals as well as for the supply of formal-care by public and private providers. Our findings indicate that postponement of the Statutory Pensionable Age (SPA) in the UK significantly delayed pension claims, prolonging working lives but also triggering routes from work to disability and home caring. In addition, our results provide evidence of unintended consequences for the mental health of workers as they approach retirement age. 

Second, our results highlight the importance of allowing for time and information to adjust to changes in pension policy in order to reduce the negative mental-health effects for those who are affected by the reform. The SPA postponement may be perceived as a decrease in pension-wealth that can only be compensated by working longer. Appropriate policy actions could help avoiding that health deterioration translates into substantial increases in financial- and social-costs associated with depression, including reduced productivity and mental health care costs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2DDC6DD6-FBF4-49E3-94AA-19DBBE352E46</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c51dc0d9d982.97799336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6FB2DA01-19F2-43E3-9320-3C027682A90F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Vulnerability and Long-term Care in Europe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98320b149bb81fd678d6c2aef4f9c406"><gtr:id>98320b149bb81fd678d6c2aef4f9c406</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brugiavini A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a94382e335fa8.09884264</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5ADAA50D-37AF-4C8D-8F56-AC48687E1676</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social Pension Income Associated With Small Improvements In Self-Reported Health Of Poor Older Men In Colombia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health affairs (Project Hope)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0795be44aa71b95ff474c2a613855c45"><gtr:id>0795be44aa71b95ff474c2a613855c45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hessel P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0278-2715</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa50869c1a528.68123752</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P000487/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
