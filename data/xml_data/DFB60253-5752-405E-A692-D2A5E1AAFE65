We currently know relatively little about how and why young men become fathers at an early age, how young fatherhood is constituted and practiced and what impact policy interventions or other kinds of support may have on these processes. The broad aim of this research is to address these gaps in knowledge in ways that are theoretically engaged, empirically innovative and policy relevant. A greater understanding of young fatherhood is essential if policy and practice responses are to be effective.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our core method is a Qualitative Longitudinal tracking study of a varied sample of 25 young fathers, conducted through three waves of in-depth interviews and two rounds of focus groups. The tracking study will be accompanied by three complementary strands of work:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Secondary analysis of existing qualitative evidence will be conducted through data sharing workshops.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>A review of policy and practice developments of our topic from the past two decades will be undertaken to produce an inventory of specialist support for young fathers.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Finally we will conduct a local case study evaluation of service provision.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed study is designed to generate useful and distinctive knowledge for policy and professional practice; we have built in specific research questions designed to address policy and practice concerns. We envisage that it will also benefit young fathers, and will increase understanding of their lives, and the lives of their families and children. The tracking study will yield knowledge on the entry of young men into fatherhood, including their values and attitudes towards contraception and abortion; on the constitution of young fatherhood; the dynamics of their lives; and insights into their life chances. The study will also generate data on their support needs and views on provision. The secondary analysis strand of work will place this new data in wider perspective, thereby ensuring a broad and robust evidence base. The knowledge generated will benefit professionals across a range of fields and in statutory and voluntary sectors wherever support is provided for young men and young parents. This includes those commissioning and providing SRE (Sex and Relationship Education) to young men in varied settings, and those supporting prospective and new young fathers through generic and specialist pre-natal and parenting services, including the Early Start programmes and Family-Nurse partnerships. The study is likely to be of direct interest to parents and young people, and to professionals who work with young men and fathers, including schools, health and social services, family support services, youth groups and parental advice groups. It will benefit policy makers who are engaged in the task of developing effective strategies and practice guidance in response to early pregnancy and fatherhood in a context where current knowledge is patchy and limited. In the light of our base line study, we anticipate too that the young fathers in the sample will benefit directly from their inclusion in a process that seeks to understand their subjective experiences, enables their views to be counted and empowers them in a context where they are often marginalised (Owen et al 2008).
 
The local case study evaluation will yield data on the effectiveness and appropriateness of service provision for young fathers. This data will be of direct use to local practitioners and service providers as they implement a new early intervention service for young and disadvantaged parents and parents-to-be. The case study will facilitate professionals in tracking and reflecting upon the development of their service. The focus groups will enable them to take stock and reflect collectively on how the initiative is developing and what might improve provision. The research will serve as a mechanism to bring practitioners, service providers and young fathers into conversation with each other, achieved via focus groups and a practitioner training day at which young fathers will be encouraged to speak. More broadly the research has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy in this important field and in enhancing the quality of life for young fathers and their families. 

The anticipated impacts on policy and practice are both instrumental and conceptual and will be achieved through a combination of methods designed to take effect over a relatively short period of time (described further in the pathways to impact). These include a Qualitative Longitudinal (QL) design for the tracking of real time developments; a collaborative 'knowledge to action' framework; targeted outputs and events; and a multi-disciplinary forum for shared information and debate (Following Fathers Network). Research-practice partnerships can be effective in leading to organisational improvements (Nutley 2010). The ethics of this process are important, reflecting a commitment by the research team to enable service providers to develop research-based practice and to gain a sense of joint ownership of the process and outcomes of the study.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>452184</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Parliament of UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>All Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood</gtr:department><gtr:description>Early Intervention Foundation, All Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood, Leeds City Council, Oakhill Secure Training Centre, Young Dads Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DB2AF13-E650-4A1E-9B67-7C4C12A878F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint and commissioned publications in Neale and Davies (eds) Seeing young Fathers in a Different Way Open Space for Families, Relationships and Societies July 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56a93ee08a33f1.49915886-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Early Intervention Foundation, All Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood and Working with Men: Fora for dissemination and promotion of evidence to policy makers

The project has resulted in funding for a one-year impact initiative (University of Leeds) in collaboration with the Family and Childcare Trust, Leeds City Council, Young offender practitioners and the APPG on fatherhood. This is designed to feed the findings of the study into practice developments, including advancing joined up, sustained provision for young offender fathers entering re-settlement, developing the Young Dads Collective North, training young fathers in mentoring and advocacy work, and establishing a national training program for practitioners working with young fathers. Details of the Supporting Young Dads initiative are available on the FYF s website.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A3EDDE26-386F-4962-BA7C-F39006693FFA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56a683371d0e63.88465078</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Following Young Fathers: Key Findings. 
Bren Neale and Carmen Lau Clayton




Our findings are reported in publications and briefing papers available at www.followingfathers.leeds.ac.uk. The research extended a baseline study begun under ESRC Timescapes (Neale and Lau Clayton 2011; 2014; Neale and Morton 2012; Neale 2013, Neale 2015b, referred to below). 

1. Lived experiences. 
We tracked 31 young fathers (aged 15-25) over time (see Neale et al briefing 8 for methodology), revealing their aspirations to 'be there' in an enduring and meaningful relationship with their children. This was so regardless of socio-economic background, life circumstances, partnered, single, resident or non resident status, or the relationship with the mother. In 29 cases the pregnancies were not planned but this did not mean an unwanted child. Wherever they could, fathers developed and sustained regular contact with their children over a 2-4 year period. These findings challenge entrenched views of young fathers as 'feckless' (Neale et al briefing 1, Neale 2015a, Neale and Davies 2015a, 2015b). 
Yet there are barriers to establishing a role and identity as a young father, including 1) socio-economic hardship: limited opportunities to develop a 'breadwinner' role (Neale and Davies 2015a; briefing 4); 2) minimal housing support (Neale and Ladlow briefing 7); lack of parenting skills and experience (Neale et al briefing 1; Neale briefing 6); and 4) volatile relationships with mothers and maternal grandparents. In a culture where mothers remain primary carers and decisions run vertically down the maternal line, contact could be curtailed or blocked (Lau Clayton briefing 2; Neale and Lau Clayton 2014 and briefing 3). For those living with long term poverty or as young offenders, negative public perceptions and limited professional support could compound these problems (Ladlow and Neale 2015; Neale and Ladlow briefing 5, Neale briefing 6).

2. Policy Responses. 
While pockets of good professional practice exist, there is no coherent or unifying policy to guide professional development in recognising and pro-actively supporting young fathers: support services are sorely needed but hard to access. The assumption is that young fathers are 'hard to reach', resulting in a culture of 'sidelining' them as a risk, rather than treating them as a resource for their children (Neale 2015a, Neale briefing 6, Neale and Davies 2015b; Davies and Neale 2015). There is a pressing need to change the way young fathers are represented and understood in society. Promoting the collective voices of young fathers, as 'experts by experience' is an essential part of this process (Neale 2015a; briefing 6; Neale and Davies 2015b). 

3. Methods and Research Infrastructure. 
We have advanced qualitative longitudinal methods and ethics (Neale 2013; Neale 2015b, Lau Clayton 2013) and built capacity in participatory research and the co-construction/co-dissemination of knowledge with young fathers and our networks of practitioners over time (Neale and Morton 2012, Neale et al briefing 8; Neale and Davies 2015b). These collaborations culminated in an impact initiative proposal to the University of Leeds, which was successfully funded. It comprises three work packages that will embed the findings of the study centrally into professional practice and training (Neale and Tarrant; see website). We developed new protocols for data management/archiving as part of the phase 2 development of the Timescapes Archive. The composite dataset was shared for secondary use and archived during the life time of the project (Neale et al briefing 8).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In collaboration with key stakeholders in our practitioner network, Neale and Tarrant, with support from Lau Clayton, have developed an impact initiative that has been funded via the University of Leeds Impact Acceleration Fund. The work, which is scheduled for 12 months from April 2016, and involves three work packages. These are designed to take forward the findings from the FF study to create a new culture of support for young fathers across sectors (local authority, leading family charity and private consortium in the secure estate). The new initiative, Supporting young Dads (SYD) is described on the FF website.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DCABB2D6-BB60-470A-A6F0-E5C0E3E7717C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>564ddbc9c48955.53806786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.followingfathers.leeds.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Empirical and methodological contribution to Family Strategic Partnership (Department for Education funded) review on young fatherhood</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94012698-CCF1-4102-9A5A-659845A726C4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ab3b48bc31f3.74894297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Department for Work and Pensions invited consultation on contributions of young fathers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B25A2704-FCC8-43D2-9242-B23E8C34827C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a9cb5e735b72.65960574</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Seeing young Fathers in a Different Way: National Practitioner Conference</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A292182-D084-4160-A096-DA4424F6E40B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>564261d2e135e8.99177270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Engagement in the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood, Sub group on young fatherhood, Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAEB7017-B78B-4D8C-979D-345D21038F43</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>563931ba50ae89.36502202</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Production of briefing papers series and resource booklets for policy and practice use (see publications for details).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C448AA9-AA21-492C-8C00-D1FABD2051A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5637ed614edde4.12158164</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://followingfathers.leeds.ac.uk/findings</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>During the course of this study we held data sharing workshops, made our dataset available for re-use and secondary analysis with selected projects, and provided the test case for the phase two development of the Timescapes Archive, supporting the development of the new open source software, the user interface and the spread sheets used for data management and preparation of data for archiving. We also set up the landing pages for projects depositing their data with the Timescapes Archive and supported the development of mechanisms to publicise the archive and promote research. Neale created a new website for the Archive during 2014, and has produced a new guide for depositors, working with the archive team.
