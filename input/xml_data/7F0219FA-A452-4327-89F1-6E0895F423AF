The surfaces act as artificial birefringent materials, to provide excellent polarization selectivity, or spatially varying artificial dielectrics to act as lenses. Because they are compact, robust, lightweight and exhibit favourable properties of low-loss and high predictability of performance these surfaces have the potential of altering the basic designs of a variety of instruments operating in the microwave to sub-mm wave regions of the spectrum. Examples include: telecommunications systems, radar systems, millimetre wave imaging, satellite communications, Earth observations and space science, industrial non-destructive testing and inspection, biological investigation, remote sensing, security, laboratory testing facilities and astronomical instrumentation.The new surfaces are more complex realizations of the metal grid techniques used in frequency selective surfaces (FSS). As with FSS they can be made by means of copper evaporation onto plastic substrates with the geometrical structures defined by standard photolithographic techniques. The manufacturing costs are therefore low. The innovations are: i) the design of large-scale spatially-invariant geometrical anisotropies to provide different behaviour for orthogonal polarization states; ii) the design of spatially-variant geometries-resulting in gradients in effective refractive. These innovations are based on: i) a deep physical understanding of the physics of the interaction of EM waves with lumped complex impedance elements; ii) the use of standard software (HFSS) to extract the lumped element characteristics-normally inferred empirically; iii) the ability accurately to model complex structures with large numbers of elements-beyond the capabilities of current commercial codes running on PCs.The PI works within the Manchester Radio Technology Group within the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. The expertise, the processing and the testing facilities of the RTG group will greatly facilitate the successful completion of the research programme. The success of this grant application will be a key step in transferring considerable knowledge from the area of radioastronomy to solve real needs in the broader technological arena.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is an innovative basic research programme aimed at producing lightweight, low-cost but high performance metal mesh surfaces able to provide excellent polarization selectivity or powerful focusing of radiation; they have the potential to alter the basic designs of instruments operating in the microwave to sub-mm wave regions of the spectrum. The new surfaces will provide new capabiliites to systems designers - cheap high quality polarization discrimination will allow new modalities for imaging/inspection while planar lenses will allow new ways to design lightweight large aperture radiation collectors. There is a wide diversity of applications on which the new devices can have an impact: telecommunications and radar systems, millimetre wave imaging, satellite communications, Earth observations and space science, industrial non-destructive testing and inspection, biological investigation, remote sensing, security, laboratory testing facilities and astronomical instrumentation. This list emphasizes the ubiquity of the radio spectrum for society and hence the commercial private sector, the public sector and the pure science sector will benefit from the research outcomes. The programme will have impact on health, culture and wealth - all of which are intimately linked since any new instrumentation will be constructed by the commercial sector. For the health and quality of life impacts one can point to the potential use of the outputs in the security screening sector and a range of material and biological investigations from GHz to THz. The Feb 2009 meeting on Terahertz Systems and Industrial Applications at the Royal Society involved non-destructive testing, imaging and substance identification in industries as diverse as military, aerospace, pharmaceutical, healthcare, food &amp;amp; drink. The whole telecommunications arena is also a major contributor to the quality of everyday life. In terms of culture one can point to the roles of these new devices in systems aimed knowledge-based investigations - for example space science and astronomy/cosmology - in which the public and hence the media show a continuing interest. The timescales to demonstrate fully the capabilities of the devices are simply the two years of the proposed programme since the basic metal mesh construction methodology is well proven - the innovation will be in terms of software for efficiently calculating the collective properties of large area surfaces from a knowledge of their local area (lumped) properties. The timescale for the take-up of this technology depends on making the new capabilities clear to systems designers. Communication will be via the standard academic routes of publication in journals and presentations at high impact conferences which will involve potential industrial partners. Engagement with industry will build on existing partnerships and linkages built up with UK companies via existing microwave and mm-wave imaging programmes in Manchester, including colleagues in the Microelectronics and Nanostructures group in the School of Electrical &amp;amp; Electronic Engineering. Manchester academics have also developed a close linkage with the Electronics Knowledge Transfer Network (eKTN) to identify and pursue industrial partnerships for the Square Kilometre Array programme and one of them is on the eKTN Board. The PI is therefore very well placed to develop existing company links established by close colleagues and to use their experience of Knowledge Transfer programmes. The programme is aimed at the forefront on EM technology - and staff working on the programme will, perforce, become skilled in basic EM physics and able to translate this into effective use of commercial software. The innovative stage is the production of new specialized software able to make large area calculation of collective surface properties feasible on PC-level hardware. These high-level skills are generic and of immediate interest to UK industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97728</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The success of this grant was related to the realisation of two new types of device: mesh-HWPs and mesh-lenses. These metamaterial devices, unique worldwide, have later on generated different consultancy funds (which also supported salaries) coming from the University of Cambridge, NASA GSFC, the University of Rome, Chinese University of Hong Kong and the John Hopkins University.

Soon after the end of the grant, in 2013, the mesh-HWP work was followed by the award of an European Space Agency (ESA) grant (AO/1-7136) for the development of large diameters mesh-HWPs for application to specific future ESA satellite missions. The mesh-lens work also was further developed and adopted as a main solution in another ESA grant (AO/1-7393) targeted to the development of compact focal plane arrays (mesh-lens arrays), still addressed to specific ESA missions. These developments, still ongoing, have more recently attracted the attention of the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) which is interested in adopting our technologies for the LiteBird satellite mission, currently in the phase-A study.

In summary, the work started with the EPSRC grant on mesh-HWPs and mesh-lenses had further big developments and applications, especially in the astronomical instrumentation field. Mesh-HWPs have been designed and used for astronomical observations in instruments like CASPER (Italy), NIKA1 and NIKA2 (France), Blast TNG (USA) and ASTE (Hong-Kong). Other devices are currently being designed and manufactured for upcoming experiments such as LSPE (Italy), ACT-Pol (USA), CLASS (USA) and QUBIC (France).

The UK has been world-wide leader in the design and production of mesh-technology based filters for decades. The more recent developments, started with the EPSRC grant in the direction of mesh-based retarder-plates and planar-lenses has reinforced the UK leading position which is today providing to the scientific community new alternative solutions that were not available before and that are not available anywhere else worldwide.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>50EE5B85-2A11-49A4-A45E-7950E989ABBD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dda6db00c1c3.80649908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall aims and goals of the programme were successfully and fully achieved, i.e. the development of new artificial dielectrics and birefringent materials based on metamaterials and the realisation of quasi-optical retarder-plates and new types of planar-lenses. 

We have achieved the following main results:
1. New knowledge: we have designed, manufactured and tested novel quasi-optical devices based on metamaterials never realised before. Specifically, we have developed retarder-plates (Mesh Quarter-Wave Plates and Mesh Half-Wave Plates) able to replace ordinary crystal-based devices and novel planar-lenses (Mesh-Lenses) with performances superior to the conventional equivalent dielectric devices. All the devices work in the frequency range 75-110GHz. 
 
2. New methods and skills: we had improvements in three areas: 
(A-Software development) - We have developed very accurate computer codes based on a combination of Finite-Element Analysis and transmission-line codes able to accurately model the metamaterial-based artificial dielectrics and the birefringent materials required to design the above retarder-plates and planar-lenses. Still today, there are no commercially available codes able to model these structures with the required accuracy and timescales. 
(B-Laboratory Testing) - The new devices required testing accuracy levels never achieved before. The phase-measurements required to characterise the retarder-plates are extremely difficult to carry out with accuracy at the degree level. We did use particular optical setups to reduce standing-waves, we did mechanically isolate the system to avoid extra-noise and we did use differential measurements in order to reject the intrinsic drifts of the sources. 
(C-Manufacturing) - The new retarders and lenses required to revisit our manufacturing processes. The metamaterial anisotropic grids of the retarders required to be stacked and accurately aligned parallel to each other. The metamaterial inhomogeneous grids of the planar lenses required to be stacked and positioned on top of each other at the single element level of the grids. The minimisation of losses was also addressed at manufacturing level.

3. Research collaborations: the devices developed above are very innovative. They are compact, lightweight, planar, robust low-loss and with highly predictable performance. These devices can replace the traditional ones which often lack of some of the above performances. The novelty of these devices generated interest in research collaborations (NASA) and also requests for their use in millimetre-wave astronomical instrumentation (NIKA, NIKA2 at IRAM). 

In summary, adopting the mesh-filters technology, we have developed mesh-retarders and mesh-lenses. This required designing anisotropic grid geometries in the first case and spatially inhomogeneous grids in the other. 

We have realised a mesh-QWP (polariser) to create circularly polarised beams from linearly polarised fields, and a mesh-HWP to be used as polarisation rotator. Both devices resulted in excellent agreement with the simulations and with performances never achieved before. These devices are much thinner and lighter than natural birefringent plates. 

We have realised retarding surfaces with phase-shift varying across their surface: mesh-lenses. These flat and very thin devices were designed to reproduce the phase profile of normal dielectric lenses. The focusing properties were successfully tested and the far field beam resulted almost identical to that created by an equivalent thick dielectric lens.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Keeping on the side the specific devices developed within this grant, our general achievement is to have developed mesh-technology/metamaterial-based surfaces where we are able to arbitrarily manipulate the amplitude, the phase and the polarisation of the millimetre-wave radiation passing through it. We have achieved transmission accuracy at few percent level and phase-shifts at few degrees level. We have also shown the accurate 'local' control of both quantities across the surface of flat lenses. 

The ability to locally modify the electromagnetic field in an arbitrary fashion opens the possibility to design arbitrary surfaces with even more exotic characteristics. The range of applications gets much broader, not limited to polarimetry or imaging systems but to any kind of passive system which requires the arbitrary manipulation of the amplitude, phase and polarisation status of the radiation. The applications range from laboratory instrumentation, non-destructive testing and astronomical instrumentation to telecommunication and security applications. In addition, a variety of passive QO devices used in current instruments operating in the microwave to sub-millimetre regions can be replaced by new metamaterial-based equivalent components with performances that, in different cases, cannot be achieved by means of the classical design/fabrication techniques. We are referring to low-losses, compactness, planarity, low weight, etc.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7B2567E4-9E50-445E-A75A-49DA34D86F3A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc8d3d00d918.74237033</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
