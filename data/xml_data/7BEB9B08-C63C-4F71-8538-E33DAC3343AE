Much of the pre-classical music left to us is more a framework than a literal text, similar to the kinds of sketches used in jazz, generally containing a melody in a very simple version with suggested harmonies. From this skeleton the musicians, equipped with well-honed improvisation skills, will embellish the sketch into a sophisticated and personal performance. As the standards of early music performance continue to rise and become more adventurous, performers are now ready to take their expertise to another level by refining their improvising skills to transform their sketches into virtuosic performances and realise the full potential of this rich repertoire. \n\nAs an AHRC Fellow in the Creative and Performing Arts, one aspect of my research project centres around the unusual and often complex forms of improvisation, particularly on chordal instruments, that were commonplace in Italy in the 17th century. Ensembles of long-necked lutes, harpsichords, violins, and 'cornetti' would participate in church feast-day celebrations where they would create group extemporisations which contemporaries described as heavenly music on earth. Through my research project I aim to revive this art by establishing an ensemble, essentially an 'early music big band', devoted to experimentation, performance and promotion of rarely-attempted forms of early improvisation. \n\nEarly music is one of the only areas of classical music which has a built-in element for improvisation, and yet most modern-day practitioners have only just scratched the surface of what is possible. I aim to redress the balance by creating musical experiences on the classical music platform which involve the public in the exhilaration created by the invention of music on the spot. The notion of an entire ensemble improvising simultaneously within an intricate set of boundaries is both astonishing and exciting. Our starting point will be theoretical materials on extemporization left to us from the 16th and 17th centuries coupled with analysis of early 17th-century Italian music which imitates improvised music. Our scholarly findings will be used to inspire our practical music-making. There will be no 'cross-over' or 'fusion' here: while we may take advice from modern improvisers on how to structure our practising and ensemble skills, we shall not be relying on folk, 'world', or jazz musicians to provide the improvisation for us, which can often be the case in groups which feature early extemporization. \n\nThis project captured the imagination of Marshall Marcus, Head of Music at London's Southbank Centre, who is devoted to promoting improvisation in classical music spheres. He has proposed an Early Music Improvisation Weekend in October 2009 which will feature more sophisticated forms of early extemporization; my ensemble will be a focal point of the weekend, presenting an open rehearsal, concert, and improvisation workshop open to the general public. The ensemble will consist of high-calibre musicians who have been hand-picked for their experience and improvisation skills. We shall undertake an extensive period of research and development to prepare for this groundbreaking event. Our rehearsals will be filmed in order to present a documentary which records our process in the foyer of the Centre during the weekend. I aim to secure other concerts and workshops for the ensemble around this time in order to reach a wider public and provide the opportunity for us to further hone our skills. I also intend to record our rehearsals and concerts professionally in the hope of producing a self-financed commercial CD of our best extemporized material over this period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16417</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I was interviewed for two programmes for BBC Radio 3's Early Music Show on the creation of The Division Lobby and London Southbank Centre's 'Take the Risk' weekend of early improvisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>A59B64AB-D5EB-4779-B527-185C6B962974</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invitations to do workshops and lectures on early improvisation, promotional material, positive audience feedback about the radio programme and the performances by The Division Lobby</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546441bfc5fd16.34472897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Programmes for BBC Radio 3's Early Music Show</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Concert with the Division Lobby at a private venue in London</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2910D5C-7BFD-4E1E-B0D5-C4A0F2046A03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This concert gave the group the opportunity to put its findings in rehearsal into practice, and to develop improvisation skills in performance, particularly in ensemble.

However, this project involved a specific sort of improvisation which was prevalent in early 17th-century Italy in particular, and therefore it was necessary for me to provide some members of the ensemble with specific materials which were relevant to that time and place. This was particularly the case with the singer Mark Tucker, to whom I gave materials specifically relating to vocal improvisation; I also gave him a series of sessions on how to work with these materials. By suggesting that individuals concentrate on a few key treatises and providing material from each, this established a cohesive style for the improvisations, which was as important to the dissemination of information as it was to the musical performance as a whole. 

I also provided the group with audio recordings of many of the frameworks used in our concert, which they used to aid their individual practise. Many found these tools invaluable. 

I have also used many of these materials in workshops, classes, and lecture/demonstrations on early improvisation and The Division Lobby project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8479998892.620205a714e580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Edition and distribution of materials from 16th- and 17th-century improvisation treatises</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2008</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Concert with the Division Lobby at Concertgebouw, Belgium</gtr:description><gtr:id>91F8FE54-B515-44E1-88D0-61AA452A9E08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This concert gave the group the opportunity to put its findings in rehearsal into practice, and to develop improvisation skills in performance, particularly in ensemble.

I also had to edit some of the published editions. A significant amount of the material had to be adapted for the number of musicians in the group and for the intended performances. All of these tasks contributed to the improvement of my skills as a music editor, tasks from which I learned an enormous amount. Editing the music increased my familiarity with both musical and printing conventions of early 17th-century Italy and the calligraphic styles in various 17th-century manuscripts. Occasionally members of the ensemble provided their opinions and solutions for how best to present each framework, and in one case I created a special form of notation at the suggestion of the singer Mark Tucker which transformed the way we approached the improvisation. 

By editing this music I also now have a body of material from which I can draw when doing workshops and lecture/demonstrations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1466193554.4257922a714d536</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Performing editions for The Division Lobby programme</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Concert with the Division Lobby at the Sir Jack Lyons concert Hall, University of York</gtr:description><gtr:id>38187D54-F6FE-4A6A-A7EF-3B530BB899AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This concert gave the group the opportunity to put its findings in rehearsal into practice, and to develop improvisation skills in performance, particularly in ensemble.

This scheme instilled me with much more confidence and helped me to further hone my improvisation skills; I passed many of my findings and observations on to students and colleagues about how to prepare to improvise in public, which had a positive impact on their own learning and practise. It was also extremely beneficial to have three opportunities in quick succession to practise improvising this sort of piece for live audiences. Judging by the audiences' reactions to the improvised pieces and those of my colleagues, and comments from the audience after the concert, the extemporised elements of this programme were enthusiastically received and made a profound impact on the general atmosphere of the concerts: the public felt much more involved in the experience and very much enjoyed the more informal tone of the concert in general.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d914dfbca886.43656355</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Performance Practice seminar on early 17th-century improvisation for the Historical Performance Dept. of the Royal Academy of Music, 22/10/15</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C9B56EB-0988-49B5-AB75-4D950501F866</gtr:id><gtr:impact>For this Performance Practice seminar, with about 30 attendees, I gave a lecture on the subject of early 17th-century musical improvisation followed by a practical session where all the students participated.

This was an engaging discussion between the concert audience and the musicians about how the evidence regarding musical improvisation in early 17th-century Italy was used to create an improvised programme. Much information was imparted about the process of how one creates such an ensemble and programme. There was much interest in and information imparted about what material was used as 'framework' for the improvisations, and also about the musical instruments used.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8230143457.8654770be63c70</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thedivisionlobby.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open Rehearsal with The Division Lobby for London Southbank Centre's 'Take the Risk' weekend of early improvisation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F4B6222E-FC5D-4A5C-8F04-6EFF09DB4B17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a demonstration of how the group 'rehearsed' improvised pieces in ensemble, with explanations and questions from the audience.

This took place at Club In&amp;eacute;gales, which provides a platform for improvised music in an informal atmosphere more akin to a jazz club than a concert hall. Notes In&amp;eacute;gales did a 20-min set of their own contemporary extemporisations, followed by a set by my early music colleague and me of improvisation in 17th-century Italian style, using the traditional method of creating structures for improvisation derived from pre-composed madrigals. For a final set all the musicians joined forces to create further contemporary improvised pieces; for one of these pieces we used a 17th-century structure composed specifically as a basis for creating an extemporised piece. For a large percentage of this audience it was the first time they'd ever heard improvised music in 17th-century style, and their enthusiasm and interest was enormous. We provided explanations of the style and structures used and discussed the 17th-century materials we used to learn to improvise in this style. Many attendees were interested in finding out more about this type of improvisation and how they could learn to do it themselves. An arts journalist who attended the concert expressed an interest in writing an article about early improvisation in the near future, and asked to interview me on the subject. One of the most interesting aspects of this evening for me was the bringing together of musicians from diverse musical disciplines; added to this was the profound impact the 17th-century style improvisation had on an audience more used to listening to contemporary extemporisation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d91c108d7460.98382891</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Chair for the session 'The Lost Art of Ornamentation' at the Medieval and Renaissance Music Conference 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BB359CA-56A2-4D2F-AE91-1BF4CA31F900</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I introduced the speakers and the importance of their research and papers.

Several factors make this project unique. It was underpinned by scholarly research and musicological rigour and involved the vitally important dissemination of my findings to colleagues within and outside of The Division Lobby, but the most significant feature of the project was that this dissemination was also brought to the general public through a series of concerts, workshops, and radio programmes. 

An important aspect of the creation of The Division Lobby and my curatorship of London Southbank Centre's 'Take the Risk' weekend of early improvisation was the opportunity to prove what I have always suspected: a project of improvised early music is not only possible, but also desirable and inspiring. Extemporization in early music concerts is often met with discouragement, disdain, or downright hostility from group directors. It was totally liberating finally to be given a proper chance to improvise unimpeded by the fears and doubts of others. This was important for our audiences to experience, especially on the classical music platform. The impact on the opinions and observations of the general public regarding improvisation was noticeable throughout the weekend, from the 'Take the Risk' weekend's first event, an open discussion forum involving key artists and the audience, to the workshop at the end of the weekend. Our concerts were attended by a high percentage of professional musicians, both early music and non-specialists (in particular jazz and contemporary improvisers), in addition to composers, students, radio and newspaper journalists, concert promoters, group directors, and amateur musicians, who attested to an experience combining informative content with musical pleasure. 

As curator of 'Take the Risk' I was given free reign to choose ground-breaking programmes with first-rate international artists; this provided a unique opportunity for both established and newly-formed ensembles to introduce rarely-heard forms of extemporization to the general public.
