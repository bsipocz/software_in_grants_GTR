Existing regulations and mitigation measures are based on assumed effects. Lack of information means that the regulations may be either too onerous and recommended mitigation measures may be unnecessary or ineffective. There is a clear need to improve our understanding of how animals perceive and respond to devices and how these responses affect their behaviour, distribution and ultimately fitness.
The RESPONSE project is a multi-disciplinary study focussing on causal links between marine renewable devices (MRD) and changes in the fine-scale distribution and behaviour of marine vertebrates. The overall aim of the project is to identify and quantify actual risk of negative consequences and therefore remove one key layer of uncertainty in the scale of risk to the industry and natural environment. 
The main objectives are to:
1. understand how stakeholders see the risks to the industry and to the environment.
2. measure the fine scale distribution of marine wildlife in high tidal and wave energy sites to understand how seals, cetaceans, birds and 
 large fish use such areas.
3. characterise acoustic, visual and electromagnetic signals that MRDs produce and assess the reactions of marine wildlife to those cues.
4. use the results in habitat preference models to infer zones of influence and avoidance associated with MRDs at both small and large 
 scales.
5. develop effective mitigation methods 

We will achieve these objectives through a set of inter-related sub projects that will:-
1. bring together a UK wide group of regulators, conservation groups and industry to assess the perception of risk to the industry and 
 environment posed by negative interactions with marine wildlife. 
2. use novel, high resolution GPS transmitters for seals and state of the art passive acoustics, active sonar and visual observation techniques 
 for porpoises, seabirds and fish to record details of their habitat use and behaviour in and around operational wave and tidal test sites and 
 an un-developed high energy tide site. These studies will be co-ordinated with FLOWBEC, another NERC/Defra funded project monitoring 
 the physical characteristics of the marine environment at these high energy sites
3. carryout a programme of physical measurements to characterise the outputs of MRDs that have a potential to cause disturbance to marine 
 wildlife. 
4. carry out a series of controlled exposure/behaviour response trials with captive seals and with wild free ranging seals and porpoises. 
5. use visual and acoustic observation data and the operating schedules of existing MRDs to assess the responses of seabirds to MRD 
 operations. 
The results of 1 to 5 will be used to describe the effects of MRDs on individual animals over the short term, i.e. how they react to the stimuli, and over the medium to long term, i.e. how they change their movements and behaviour in response to exposure to the stimuli. These results will be used as direct input to the EBAO project, another NERC/Defra funded project modeling the potential impacts of large scale arrays of MRDs. 
This project will provide a step change in knowledge about the existence and importance of adverse effects of MRDs and provide an ability to predict impacts

The marine environment is less variable, more predictable than the terrestrial environment and hence most marine species rely on the predictability of daily, biweekly and seasonal currents and local levels of mixing to drive their foraging and reproducing behaviours. In order to safely design and deploy large renewable developments we need to understand how mobile predators, fish, seabirds and mammals use the predictability of ocean environments to successfully forage. To understand the ecological effects of marine renewable developments we must shift the focus of research form the distributions of species onto a more fundamentally mechanistic and hypothesis driven understanding of reasons for specific areas of high foraging activity. 



This talk will cover 3 main issues, using data from our empirical and modelling research, to explore the effects of renewable energy extraction influencing mobile predator foraging: 1) identifying reasons for locations of, and the potential mechanisms producing predictable foraging areas, 2) the knowledge gained on foraging habitat use by understanding the limits of foraging energy expenditure and 3) the need to explore in detail underwater foraging behaviour. The presentation will cover new surveys techniques including the collection of continuous data over a full spring-neap cycle via a combination of two upward facing sonar systems: multi-frequency and multibeam devices. These systems collected data on diving seabirds, fish species and turbulence, imaging a full `acoustic curtain' along the tidal flow in a highly challenging environment from a seabed frame placed within 25 m of an OpenHydro tidal turbine structure at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) tidal test site in Scotland, UK.

This study set out to assess the possible range of direct and indirect impacts tidal stream turbines could have many upon seabird populations, and in particular the risk of direct collisions between individuals and moving components which is what currently still causing the most concern. However, it is likely that not all species of diving seabirds are equally vulnerable. Part of predicting which species are most vulnerable involves the estimation of spatial overlap between a species specific foraging distributions and the location of tidal stream turbines. 
To begin to quantify the potential population level effects a range of methods and approaches were used that help to predict whether individual species: (1) exploit areas suitable for tidal stream turbines, (2) dive near tidal stream turbines within these areas, or (3) dive to depths where moving components are found. This approach required a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic links between physical oceanographic conditions and foraging opportunities. Therefore, multi-disciplinary approaches incorporating methods were needed to quantify the physical conditions and identify foraging behaviour over large and small spatial scales. 
Comparisons between shore-based and boat-based surveys were first analysed to answer the first issue of whether seabirds actively forage in areas suitable for tidal stream turbines. Most shore based surveys use single vantage points and extensive grid systems to record the locations of foraging birds as were the multiple year surveys performed in the Fall of Warness (FOW), Orkney, UK. are used to evaluate their effectiveness for quantifying and statistically analysing spatial overlap in large tidal passes. Whilst it was possible to quantify and statistically analyse the amount of spatial overlap between foraging seabirds and locations of areas to be used by tidal stream turbines, viable statistical analysis required data sacrifices through the use of presence rather than abundance data due to the high percentage of zeros in the data sets. Moreover, comparisons between simultaneous shore-based and boat-based surveys, which are assumed to represent the more accurate method, showed that sightings from shore were biased towards non-turbine microhabitats. This shore-based survey bias reflected low detection rates of foraging birds in the faster unidirectional currents, i.e. those favoured for the locations optimal for tidal stream turbines. These studies suggested that future shore-based surveys could overcome such biases by using several vantage points spread throughout large tidal passes, and comparing species use of neighbouring turbine and non-turbine microhabitats at reasonable distances to the vantage points (&amp;lt;2 km) during favourable sea states (Beaufort Scale &amp;lt; 3). It is hoped that these recommendations lead to the development of standardised shore-based survey methods, providing comparable measurements of spatial overlap across tidal passes earmarked for array deployments. 
Tidal stream turbines could have several direct impacts upon pursuit-diving seabirds foraging within tidal stream environments including both collisions and displacement. To be able to answer the second and third issues of whether seabirds actually dive near tidal stream turbines and at the depths of moving components within these area requires a detailed understanding of how foraging seabirds respond to temporally variable but predictable hydrodynamic conditions immediately around devices. A clear understanding of such detailed behaviour could identify when interactions between seabirds and devices are most likely to occur. Such understanding could also help to quantify the magnitude of potential impacts, and facilitate the development of suitable mitigation measures. 
A combination of vessel-based observational surveys, Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) outputs, and hydroacoustic seabed surveys provided concurrent measures of foraging distributions and physical characteristics at a fine temporal (15 min) and spatial (500 m) resolution across a tidal stream environment suitable for array installations, during both breeding and non-breeding seasons. These data sets were then used to test for associations between foraging pursuit-diving seabirds (Atlantic puffins, black guillemots, common guillemots, European shags) and physical features. What was found was that these species associated with features such as areas of fast horizontal currents, as well as slow horizontal currents, high turbulence, downward vertical currents and also hard-rough seabeds. The identity and strength of associations differed among species, and also within species between seasons, indicative of interspecific and intraspecific variations in habitat use. However, Atlantic puffins were associated particularly strongly with areas of fast horizontal currents during breeding seasons, and European shags with areas of rough-hard seabeds and downward vertical currents during non-breeding seasons. Atlantic puffins' strong association with fast horizontal current speeds indicates that they are particularly likely to interact with tidal stream installations during breeding seasons. We recommend therefore that post-installation monitoring and mitigation measures should focus on this species and season. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) generally involve once-a-month surveys across two year periods. However, the approaches used in this study show that more focussed surveys can greatly benefit management strategies aiming to reduce the likelihood of negative impacts by facilitating the development of targeted mitigation measures. It is therefore recommended that these approaches contribute towards EIA within development sites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results and applied methods produced by this study have a wide range of potential beneficiaries in marine biology, conservation management and marine policy and are now providing valuable information for technology developers and regulators. The results support marine spatial planning policy in fields of marine management involving seals, cetaceans and seabirds and has the potential to be extended to an even wider range of marine species such as salmonids, other migratory fish species and basking sharks. The project provided a set of useful tools to assist in assessing risk resulting from rapidly developing marine activities against the background of rapid environmental change. As a consequence the results of this project will form a central part of the environmental impact assessment for each and every future marine renewable development in UK waters and will have world-wide application.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3C8E9579-2BA1-4372-B8EA-2CED5540FFDC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df202c928e88.52080400</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>DEFRA Workshop: Foresight Future of the sea</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76BCF9F0-67D9-448D-9599-DEA53B4F47FA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bf3172879e69.79257558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A new method for understating marine mobile animal use of fine scale habitat which uses a combination of vessel-based observational surveys, Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) outputs, and hydroacoustic seabed surveys that allow concurrent measures of foraging distributions of mobile marine animals and physical oceanographic characteristics at a fine temporal (15 min) and spatial (500 m) resolution across a high tidal stream environment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7150EF15-27AC-4E68-96B0-FC58E2307F7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project provided a set of useful methodologies to assist in assessing collision and displacement risk resulting from rapidly developing marine renewable activities.
