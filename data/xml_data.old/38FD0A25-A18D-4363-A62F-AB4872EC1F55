Small-scale organisations also stimulate the creative economy when they act as &amp;quot;hubs&amp;quot; or incubators where networks can grow, tools and specialist services can be shared, and innovation is inspired. It is thought that small-scale cultural activities can generate these effects without leading to displacement of local residents and cultural production activities, as regeneration projects relying on large-scale arts infrastructure have been shown to do.

This project will undertake a comparative evaluation of four local arts organisations whose work seeks to engage with their territory to produce social capital and positive social impacts. The aim is to create a reference model for these effects. Each of the partner cultural organisations and their directors already has a deep and extensive knowledge of the territories in which they operate, which has been enhanced by the research undertaken and knowledge and skills exchange structures established by The Art of Cultural Exchange. This new follow-on phase of the project will enable them to turn their expertise and learning into a tool that guides public policy: a model for identifying how small arts resources incubate arts and culture resources, providing ways to evidence the value for individuals and communities. 

Valiati and his team at CEGOV will train a key staff member from each of the four local partners to implement creative economy evaluation methodologies that they have developed for Brazil's Ministry of Culture in other contexts. The four partner arts organisations will be protagonists in identifying indicators to measure the ways in which the creative economy operates and is incubated within fragile communities. The project team will establish a common set of components that enables each organisation to map and narrate their own territories which will include indicators of local development priorities; social vulnerability and the creative economy; recognized incubators, accelerators and social development initiatives; evidence of culture and urban development. 

The project aims to discover effective ways to build the capability of small-scale arts organisations to measure and raise their own cultural value in relation to the specifics of their own local creative economy; to create a manual for the referential model, together with documentation/learning from the pilot project; to disseminate the bilingual toolkit/model through public events in Manchester, London and Rio de Janeiro; and to share these results with cultural funders and stakeholders who were engaged in the original research, 'The Art of Cultural Exchange'.

Each of the arts organisations that will participate in this follow-on phase is recognised for their success in developing the cultural value of arts initiatives that have a significant and measurable impact on individuals and their communities in fragile urban territories. They have also demonstrated through collaborations on previous research projects that they can learn from and develop new practices and perspectives through international artistic exchange. This follow-on phase will now enable them to work together with Heritage and Valiati to co-produce and test a model based on their experience and expertise that becomes a reference for policy makers and the wider cultural sector as they seek to stimulate social and economic development in fragile and peripheral territories. The respect that each of the organisations already commands within their respective communities, territories and countries - together with the network of partners that Heritage and Valiati bring to this collaboration - ensures that the learning from the original research will achieve greater reach and impact as well as serving a wider purpose.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This follow-on phase will: 
- provide evidence of the ways in which small-scale arts assets (cultural organisations) create conditions for incubating creative economy initiatives in fragile urban communities subject to multiple stress-factors (socio-economic exclusion, high levels of violence, limited access to cultural networks and institutions, etc) 
- increase the protagonism of arts organisations in calibrating their role in bringing economic benefits and social development to marginal communities 
- strengthen cultural policy and strategy development in the creative economy in relation to fragile urban communities 
- Develop an international network (UK/Brazil) that continues to monitor impacts from the original research after the follow-on phase has been complete
- improve communication between academic researchers and the wider arts sector, in particular with arts organisations that seek new opportunities to explore how best to develop the communities and territories in which they are working
- engage and collaborate with the general public, cultural industries, government and charitable organisations (e.g. Trusts and Foundations)

It will benefit researchers, the wider arts community and policy makers working in this area by providing a tested toolkit for evaluation of the value of arts organisations in bringing economic benefits and social development to urban communities under high stress.

It will benefit the four partner arts organisations and individuals working within them by developing their evaluation skills, supporting them to learn new methodologies, and increasing their understanding and knowledge about the social impacts of their work among their local communities, developing an information bank which they will be able to use for future planning as well as to demonstrate to stakeholders the value of their work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83692</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014658/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
