(1946-71)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N001605/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposal focuses on the contact with cinema during 1946-71 by isolated, religiously- conservative, linguistically-distinctive and economically-vulnerable communities in the Highlands and Islands. This contact divided communities, threatened the Gaelic language, and it was feared, fostered young people's desire to out-migrate. The project seeks to explore this in detail, before the generation that experienced it dies out. 

The formation of the Highlands and Islands Film Guild continued a pre-war initiative of the Scottish Film Council to make non-commercial cinema available to rural areas through the substandard gauge of 16mm. This continued during the second world war via the Ministry of Information and the Evacuation Film Scheme. The Film Guild was proposed to counter depopulation and improve leisure facilities for remote communities forming part of wider economic and cultural initiatives to bolster community activity, cohesion and recreation. It is a widely remembered but still unwritten part of Scottish cinema history in the period stretching from before television and extending into its early penetration into these zones. The service was often delivered personally by travelling operators with the assistance of local communities in spaces such as village or school halls not constructed for film exhibition. Localised exhibition projection in spaces shared by the operators, projector and audience, generated a different kind of cinema-going experience which is reflected in the depth of feeling and stories attached to remembering it. 

The current international turn in film history towards other cinemas underlines the shifting geography of enquiries into where and what cinema has been. Given the geography of Scotland, the history of the Film Guild adds a distinctive contribution to this research. The research will look at the operations of the Guild in terms of local community reaction (popular memory), schools, churches and third sector institutions) the local authorities, and the Scottish Office (including the Scottish Education Department, the Home and Health Department and the Highlands and Islands Development Board). It will combine archival, oral and creative research, building a historical record of rural cinema-going through a series of case studies. The project will be promoted in local media prior to each study. National and local archival research will investigate how the organisation provided and managed its cinema service. The National Archives of Scotland will provide records of programming, distribution and exhibition, promotion, revenue, attendance and audience feedback. Oral history enables the past experiences of residents and Guild operatives to be added to the historical record. A pilot study of the Orkney rural cinema scheme confirmed the importance of the operators in guaranteeing programmes, the effects of improvised exhibition demanded by the variable spaces that accommodated the cinema and a preference for programmes containing local content. A network of contacts has also been accumulated in response to project publicity. The volume of respondents demonstrates the importance of carrying out the study while it is possible to make this audience this cinema part of our cultural history.

The PI Dr. Ian Goode has researched and published on rural cinema exhibition and will be supported by a research assistant specializing in oral history. Ian is part of a leading research strand concerned with 'other' cinemas and early cinema in Scotland. He has expertise in Scottish Film and Television and post-war cinema culture. The CI Dr. Sarah Neely specialises in Scottish Cinema, the Orkney based director Margaret Tait, and archival research. Neely has a background in facilitating creative writing. The CI Professor Callum Brown is a leading historian of religion and society in the west, with expertise in Scotland in the 19th and 20th centuries, and with extensive experience in oral history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Community engagement 
The recording of the experience of and involvement in the mobile cinema by local communities will create a historical record that will take cinema history beyond the cities and provide a digital resource to benefit the growing number of local history, heritage and rural community groups and related co-ordinating bodies throughout the region. 

The creative writing produced by the project will be of interest of local fiction authors and groups within and without the region as an example of how local cultural heritage can function as a catalyst for imaginative expression. 

Library and archive 
Users of the Highland Archive Service will benefit from digital access to the oral history records of the Highlands and Islands Film Guild. Transcribed interviews, focus groups, creative writing will form a historical resource about cinema history in the Highland and Islands. 

Educational outreach 
A series of publicized case studies and workshops covering the region will foster interest in the study of film and the craft and experience of its projection and exhibition as celluloid. The Film Guild is widely remembered and its significance is heightened by the disappearance of the craft of celluloid projection in the space shared by the audience. This communal experience of film shows can supplement the study of local history and heritage across the age groups. Educational resources will also be made available with the assistance of the Scottish Screen Archive. 

Project website and related media 
The website will promote the project and its key events, findings and outcomes. It will also receive submissions of contributions from members of the public who recall the Highlands and Islands Film Guild. It will also bring together a sample of memories from the case studies, creative writing workshops and associated visual materials and artefacts connected to the Film Guild such as letters, photographs, posters, limericks, stories, operators/caretakers log books. The collation of these materials will offer a unifying perspective on historical sources that might otherwise remain confined to a local audience. The future upkeep of the website after the completion of the project will be undertaken by Glasgow University.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357867</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Creative Writing contributions in the forms of short stories and poems have been collected from five writers based in the Highlands and Islands including the Edinburgh Makar Christina De Luca from Shetland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A36F85B3-0236-4AD9-8E48-AD1C1DF644C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some of the writing has been recorded visually for future use and dissemination via the project website.

The programe combined readings of recently commissioned writing inspired by memories of cinema-going with a special 16mm screening on projected from celluloid recreating a typical programme that would have been shown by the Film Guild to local communities in village halls. This included Scott of the Antarctic (1948) in colour, a newsreel, informational film and a short cartoon.

The event was designed to publicize the project to the public and local media and invite participation through interviews and/or attendance at the Creative Writing Workshop the following day. It also showcased the craft of projecting celluloid film and acted as a trigger for memories of the film shows delivered by the trained operators who represented the Highlands and Islands FIlm Guild to remote communities. The event prompted media interest from BBC Scotland and STV (Aberdeen) with a short report resulting from the latter that went out on the local evening news programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c95ccdad07b5.20642780</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://2016.invernessfilmfestival.com/timetable/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Creative Writing Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47F9373F-7EA7-484A-825D-5AFF4E3E3E2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Creative Writing workshop was held as part of the Inverness Film Festival that invited attendees to draw on their experience and memories of cinema-going with a view to producing a piece of creative writing. Discussions using museum props, examples of creative writing submitted by the public to the project, and group exercises were held by Dr Sarah Neely and Nalini Paul of the Scottish Poetry Library and a creative writing specialist. Details of the writing competition and future publication plans were also outlined at the event in Inverness.
Attendance was limited but the response was very good and encouraging. Work was initiated that could possibly feature in the future outputs of the project. The initial event in this aspect of the project was a success certainly confirmed the creative potential of memory and how the cinema and cinema-going experience can facilitate this expression. This is a key pathway to impact of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90404281f61.25900724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://2016.invernessfilmfestival.com/timetable/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A recently restored archival film about the Highlands and Islands FIlm Guild has been discovered by the Moving Image Archive in Glasgow.
