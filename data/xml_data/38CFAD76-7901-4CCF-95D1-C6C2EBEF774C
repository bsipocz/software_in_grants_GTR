This is especially the case for the 65 million people living in informal settlements or slums, as well as over 300 million people living in areas which have urban-like features but are administratively classified as rural. A significant proportion of these people were recently living in rural dwellings whilst some may still seasonally migrate back to rural areas for livelihood. In such cases, they retain strong socio-economic and cultural ties to rural areas.This project believes that this rurality can be a driving force for sustainable urban transformation, especially in the area of improved and productive sanitation, which is an area of particularly acute need in India.

Rural communities have been shown to be more closely connected to their natural environment, partly because their livelihoods are often more dependent on it, as compared to urban communities. This relative closeness to the natural environment has been connected to more sensitivity around appropriate resource use as well as preferences related to open defecation. Building on that thinking, this research will try to understand whether there are major differences in urban, newly-urbanised and rural populations in relation to sanitation and human waste management. For example, it will examine whether there is potential for more circular sanitation systems that views waste as a resource i.e. as a fertiliser in agriculture, recycled products etc in newly-urbanised communities as compared to more settled urban areas.

We will approach this research through developing three spatial transects of a Tier A1 megacity: Hyderabad. Each transect will cover the different zones of Hyderabad from the centre out into the rural areas of Telangana. This study will use a combination of participatory, qualitative and quantitative methods to assess ecosystem services, sanitation and human waste reuse perceptions and practices, and economic and institutional factors along each of these transects. 

A key feature of the research will be the integration of this data onto interactive maps through the ESRI Story Maps platform. These will be used to structure co-analysis sessions with policy and planning stakeholders to examine spatial differences in sanitation across the city. Through these exercises we will co-design new policy and planning frameworks that will bring together urban and rural sanitation into a holistic system. Ultimately, the project is designed to help develop workable solutions that will enable urban planners, managers and policy-makers to provide better services to urban populations with safer (improved public health) and productive (improved economic benefits) sanitation systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will deliver new theoretical and conceptual understanding about the role of rurality as a driver of urban transformations as well as evidence-based guidance on driving improvements in sanitation policy within Indian megacities. This makes it relevant for a broad range of direct and indirect beneficiaries. At a local-level the immediate beneficiaries will be the public authorities armed with new co-produced knowledge and insights to inform urban-rural sanitation policy especially for newly urbanised communities. This includes our participants in the City Stakeholder workshops, including representatives from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Telangana Public Health &amp;amp; Municipal Engineering Department.

These beneficiaries will co-design the project e.g. through selecting a transect, and co-produce the outputs e.g. through joint analysis of data. This will provide them with new evidence and a space for dialogue that will enable them to create new solutions for delivering sanitation in difficult contexts. This has the potential for long-term transformational impact to arise from the project with more appropriate sanitation systems as an intended legacy of the project. For this type of engagement the role of Dr Mekala as our Impact Champion is important as she has established working relationships with sanitation agencies at both city, state and national level with both Governent and non Government sector stakeholders.

At a higher level the indirect beneficiaries include national civil servants e.g. at Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, planners e.g. NITI Aayog, civil society organisations e.g. WaterAid India, and researchers e.g. Centre for Science and the Environment. The research holds relevance for these groups as they implement, support and research the national Swachh Bharat policy programme for improved sanitation and a healthier, cleaner India. These types of beneficiaries stand to benefit through the demonstration and validation of a novel but transferable methodological approach for studying and interpreting urban management issues that can be reapplied in different cities or contexts. Further the study involves advanced technical methods and tools which will benefits the civil engineering students of Hyderabad city as they can witness the process during the survey. Efforts will be made to involve and engage such students in the project.

At a global level, broader indirect beneficiaries will be the circular sanitation service providers e.g. SOIL Haiti, INGOs e.g. WaterAid, and governments e.g. Government of Bangladesh, that require new evidence and perspectives on how best to extend services for populations in the context of rapid urbanisation. Direct beneficiaries at a global level will also be the academic and research communities building on the conceptual and methodological advances delivered through the project.

A range of communication and engagement techniques and platforms have been identified to engage with all beneficiaries. This includes the availability of our online transect maps (visualised through the ESRI Story Maps platform) for a minimum of seven years available for anybody with an internet connection to analyse them. More directed strategies include the City Stakeholder Workshops, active contribution to national online platforms e.g. India Water Portal and India Sanitation Portal, and international online platforms (Sustainable Sanitation Alliance SuSanA), co-produced policy briefs and planning frameworks, and five high impact journal papers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>431400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R006865/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>78369800-A95E-49BC-94E7-8659E5C2EFEF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geography and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
