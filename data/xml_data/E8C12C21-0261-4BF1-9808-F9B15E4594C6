Although this assumption is widespread, close attention to the facts of Day's own life challenges it, and the majority of her film roles also prove otherwise, with Day most frequently portraying a woman of maturely sexual desires. This project will investigate why the rigid view of Day's virginity should have arisen and become so indelibly fixed to the star, one of the most popular in American cinema during the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nDespite this popularity, and the longevity of Day's career, work on the star is curiously meagre. The project will question, as it corrects, this oversight, suggesting the dearth of critical material results from the pass&amp;eacute; sexual rectitude Day seemingly evokes. Taking a twofold approach, the project both closely examines Day's onscreen roles and performances, and explores material from other popular media for the source of the virgin myth. Day featured continuously in public discourse, and media stories were often devoted to her personal life: it was widely known that she had been married three times and had a son. Why then did the pejorative label, 'the forty year old virgin' arise, and why has it stuck so tenaciously to Day, even now?\n\nThis project investigates a range of sources in order to discover why this maturely sexual star has become indelibly associated with maintained virginity. Firstly Day's characters and performances across her 39 films are analysed in detail, in order to see if maidenly qualities are always present. Initial findings indicate that this was not the case, and that though Day did play a variety of women with different sexual statuses (shy ing&amp;eacute;nue, brassy chorus girl, wife and mother, dignified widow), most often her characters had clearly defin sexual desires and experiences. Next, other contemporary films with similar female stars are examined, to see if, just by being in a Fifties or Sixties romantic comedy, Day would inevitably have to 'play a virgin'. Again, first findings indicate otherwise: other older female stars, even in comparable films from the same film-makers, did not face similar charges of prudishness, but were read as another female archetype, the experienced older woman. This figure can be seen to link to the 'cougar' emerging in today's media. Both then and now, the older woman's knowledgeable sexuality threatens even as it excites.\n\nAfter this close look within the films and Day's subsequent TV work, the project focuses on contemporary popular culture contexts. Using a variety of sources, including newspaper stories, articles from film, fan and lifestyle magazines, reviews and gossip, the developments in Day's screen 'persona' are charted, highlighting changing public perceptions. Film theorist Richard Dyer affirmed in his 1979 book 'Stars' that a star 'persona' was constructed across a range of media texts. These included film roles, but also moments outside the films, both public events such as premiere attendances, and more private ones like changes in partner. With Day, however, neither public nor private facts correspond with the aged maiden she is popularly supposed to play and be.\n\nWhat, then, is at stake in the maintenance of Day's notional chastity, both in its original context, and now? What is comforting about a woman in her late Thirties still being a virgin? Why - and whom - does the contrary insistence on her possession of sexual desires, agency and experience disturb? The project will endeavour to answer these questions as it charts changes in the public perception of Day, disseminating its findings within the academy via a monograph, refereed journal article and conference presentations, and to a wider audience via a series of public talks and screenings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the monograph, which is the main output of this project, and which will aim to be a 'crossover' work, accessible to a wide audience, a series of public events is planned to disseminate the project's findings and to build new links with various audience groupings.\n\nThe project is founded on the belief that the study of films and their stars can help document changing public attitudes to sex and sexuality. Its findings should enrich understanding not only of past assumptions and attitudes towards these topics, but also current ones, highlighting that the media marketing of public figures can change or even subvert their meanings. Indeed, as a mature female star ironically now mostly associated with an outmoded maidenliness, Day presents an important example of how popular media construction of her image determined and altered the ways in which she was perceived. Looking again at her film performances, the project will thus benefit members of the public, not only by offering the opportunity to appreciate the wider range of Day herself, but also by more generally encouraging the contesting of easy assumptions. To this end, the project will share its findings with a wide general audience. \n\nSectors of the public likely to be interested in the results of the project include:\n\n* fans of Doris Day\n* mature cinema goers\n* movie musical fans\n* aficionados of Hollywood cinema of the 1950s-60s\n* general film enthusiasts\n* those interested in representations of women\n* amateur historians of America in the 1950s and 1960s, and of changing public attitudes to sex\n\nIn order to reach this wide audience, I have begun planning a series of activities which I will undertake. These will include:\n\n* a 'Doris Day' at the Gulbenkian, the Regional Arts Centre for East Kent, a one-day event including talks and screenings (May 2012)\n* talks to regional groups of Day fans (summer 2012)\n* talks to local cinema societies (summer 2012)\n* radio and newspaper interviews to publicise the findings (from April 2012) \n\nI am also currently in discussion with Robin Baker, Head Curator of the BFI National Archive, about running an event or season which would publicise the project's findings at the National Film Theatre on London's South Bank. We are scheduling this for around Day's 90th birthday (April 2012) and the prospective event might range from a single illustrated talk to a partial or full retrospective of Day's work. The BFI has not mounted a full retrospective since 1980, so Day's 90th birthday would seem to offer a timely opportunity.\n\nThe planning and implementation of the impact activities outlined here will be undertaken by me as sole investigator, but working with a range of partners, such as the cinema and art centre staffs, journalists and curators. I am experienced in both presenting my own work on Day within an academic milieu and to the public, and in the organisation of events such as those mentioned above. In previous academic posts I have organised conferences, occasions which have required my involvement at all stages and levels, from writing the call for papers, choosing successful proposals, and promoting the event with posters and flyers, to booking the venue, arranging catering and accommodation, and introducing speakers. In addition to organising the events themselves I have also generated publicity for them, involving local and national media in order to gain publicity. Most recently a colleague from the American Studies Department at Kent, Dr Karen Jones, and I, organised a half-day event, 'Whipcrackaway!', around Calamity Jane. Dr Jones spoke about the real-life Western figure and I presented an illustrated talk on Day's performance as the plainswoman, following the event with a reception and then a screening of the 1953 film starring Day. This event was particularly successful in reaching beyond academic ci</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23005</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000178/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
