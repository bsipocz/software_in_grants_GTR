The current study is focused on the origins of conduct problems, involves home-observations and interviews for a socially diverse sample of 122 families of 12-year-olds who have all already taken part in ESRC-funded observational research when the children were aged 2, 3 and 6.&amp;nbsp; In the current wave, mothers will complete a detailed ?Life History Calendar? interview and both mothers and children will complete questionnaire-booklets and structured observations (eg, discussing conflict issues, solving a 3D puzzle, planning a fictional family holiday). Key study questions include:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Is there a developmental shift in the salience of specific risk factors for conduct problems? For example, do family risk factors become less powerful as children grow in autonomy?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Do changes over time in family risk factors predict individual differences in conduct problems at age 12? For example, is there a critical period during which negative life events have a particularly strong impact?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is the interplay between family and cognitive risk factors? For example, does harsh parenting have particularly adverse effects on children who show impaired self-regulatory skills or emotion understanding?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Immediate beneficiaries from this research will include policy makers, educationalists, child mental health professionals and charities aimed at supporting children and their families. In the longer term (i.e., 5 to 10 years), beneficiaries from this research will include children at risk of developing conduct problems, their families, schools and communities. As noted in the introduction, this proposal can be seen as a response to the government-commissioned Allen report, such that the findings should be of interest to all policy makers involved in developing initiatives to promote the effectiveness of early interventions. Conduct problems are a major challenge for schools, as they disrupt learning both for the children themselves and for their classmates; in extremis, conduct problems can make it difficult for schools to create a safe environment for children. Increasingly, it is recognized that schools cannot eradicate conduct problems that originate in family difficulties. Thus the findings from this research should also be helpful for educationalists (e.g., being able to distinguish between the adverse family experiences of bullies vs. bully-victims should help in the development of more effective interventions). As noted in the Allen report, without effective intervention, conduct problems present a major cost to society (e.g., in terms of special educational services for children who have been excluded from school, mental health services and costs within the criminal justice system). Refining our understanding of the factors that lead to conduct problems should improve the effectiveness of interventions and so save the public purse. Finally, the researchers working on this project will also gain valuable skills in constructing systematic and comprehensive visual records of life-events and in analysing the development of conduct problems from a temporally dynamic perspective. Such skills are likely to be valuable across several employment sectors: for example, one of the applicant's recent PhD students who became proficient in statistical modelling is now working very successfully in the financial sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:department>Waltham Foundation</gtr:department><gtr:description>Pets and Positive Relationships</gtr:description><gtr:id>4811E943-E4BC-4C2F-B141-363CF1AD22E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d95648b9d95666-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Nested study, with small grant from the Waltham Trust (&amp;pound;13k) to examine links between children's relationships with pets and their family and peer relationships.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Festival poster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>129DFCB2-D405-41F4-97D9-38BE2E0A04FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Good discussion with local families

Its overarching goal was to explore family influences on conduct problems, controlling for associations with children's cognitive abilities (assessed at previous waves of the study). Key findings can be summarized in relation to the three study questions. 
 
What is the interplay between child and family factors as predictors of disruptive behaviour in pre-teenage children? 

Here, our main finding is that mothers' ability to tune into their children's thoughts and feelings has a buffering effect upon the risk of conduct problems in pre-adolescence. Previous work with pre-schoolers has shown that the association between low maternal association and elevated problem behaviours is attenuated when mothers display high levels of 'mind-mindedness', defined as the tendency to view their children as agents with their own thoughts, feelings and interests (Meins et al, 2013). This finding has obvious implications for interventions, but its developmental scope has yet to be established. In particular, while pre-schoolers often have only a limited ability to talk about their thoughts and feelings, by pre-adolescence most children are able to clearly express their thoughts and feelings, such that one might have predicted a reduced effect of parental mind-mindedness. However, the transition to secondary school requires children to become much more independent, such that parents' willingness to recognize children's autonomy and independence in thoughts, feelings, goals and interests may be particularly important in pre-adolescence. 

In addition, while Meins et al (2013) only considered 'mind-mindedness' as a buffer against the risk of problem behaviours associated with low maternal education, this study included 7 different risk factors, of which 4 related to child characteristics (male gender, internalising and conduct problems at age 6 and low academic competence at age 12) and 3 to maternal characteristics (depressive symptoms, low education, low levels of parental monitoring). Together, the four child risk factors explained 52% of the variation in multi-measure, multi-informant ratings of conduct problems at age 12. Mothers' education, monitoring and depressive symptoms accounted for a further 7% of the variation in conduct problems at age 12. Over and above these effects, mothers' mind-mindedness accounted for 5% of unique variance in conduct problems at age 12. In total then, our predictors accounted for an impressive 64% of the variance in conduct problems. Moreover, when the children were divided into two groups according to overall levels of risk (i.e., number of factors for which they were in the risk group), this buffering effect of mothers' mind-mindedness was only evident for children at high risk of developing conduct problems.

To elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this association my team is currently applying observational coding of mother-child interactions to examine mediation effects. These mediation analyses have shown that the reduction in conduct problems associated with maternal mind-mindedness is at least partly explained by maternal warmth. In other words, being able to see the world from the child's point of view may help mothers to be responsive and affectionate, which in turn leads to improved behaviour in children. Supporting this view, analyses based on additional video-based coding of positive maternal and child behaviours and positive dyadic interactions (i.e., exchanges that are high in both reciprocity and cooperation) have shown that positive dyadic interactions predicts unique variance in multi-informant ratings of conduct problems, over and above associations between conduct problems and (low) positive child behaviour. That is, children appear less likely to engage in disruptive behaviour if their mothers are able to maintain positive interactions even when the child's own behaviour is not very positive. 

Other longitudinal analyses indicate that while there is significant stability of individual differences in family interaction quality from ages 2 to 6 and from ages 6 to 12, there are no significant associations in parent-child interaction quality between the ages of 2 and 12. Moreover, while the quality of these interactions showed moderate cross-sectional associations with multi-informant ratings of children 's disruptive behaviour at age 6 and 12; these associations were much less evident at age 2 - presumably because the behaviour of very young children shows much more day-to-day variability and context-specificity.

Are developmental trajectories in disruptive behaviour linked to trajectories in related constructs across the transition to secondary school? 

Here, preliminary analyses of children's self-report data gathered at ages 10 and 12 demonstrated that escalating problems of disruptive behaviour) were associated with negative trajectories in children's self-perceived academic ability, acceptance by peers and global self-worth. When the associations between these trajectories were examined separately by gender, these results were, in general, stronger for boys than for girls. In particular, the association between increased disruptive behaviour and reduced academic competence was significantly stronger in boys than in girls. As expected, there was also a significant gender contrast in the mean ratings of disruptive behaviour at each time-point. Viewed together, these findings are open to two competing interpretations. First, problems of disruptive behaviour in boys are not only more severe than in girls, but are also more pervasive in their impact. Alternatively, it may be that boys are more likely than girls to act out in response to academic failure. 

We also examined changes in disruptive behaviour across this school transition (ages 10 to 12) in relation to negative life events (as reported by mothers during the Life History Calendar interview). Reflecting the at-risk nature of our sample, 80% had had experienced at least one negative life events (e.g., bereavement, serious illness, marital partner violence) during this period and 62% had experienced two or more negative events in this period. However, these groups did not show more negative trajectories across the transition to secondary school than their peers, indicating an encouraging level of resilience.

Do family relationships and experiences differed between children with different kinds of involvement in bullying (i.e., pure bullies, pure victims and bully-victims)? Here, our initial analyses show remarkably similar profiles for bullies and bully-victims. The latter group includes a greater proportion of girls, but both in overall level of disruptive behaviour and in family correlates. Within the sample, 56% reported no involvement in bullying; 22% reported being victimized and 22% reported bullying others (27% of these two latter groups were bully victims). Bullying was strongly associated with low maternal education (63% of children who engaged in bullying had mothers who had left school at 16; as compared with just 32% of the children who reported no involvement in bullying).
As well as focusing on results from the age-12 home visits, my team has also continued to mine the datasets from earlier time-points in this longitudinal study. In addition, I have two PhD students (Amanda Aldercotte and Nik Darshane) who have followed up the age-12 home-visits with phone-interviews at age 13. These interviews have focused on children's experiences at school but have also included social reasoning tasks and tests of higher-order thinking skills (e.g., planning, cognitive flexibility, working memory). We will therefore shortly be able to examine whether the quality of parent-child interactions (as rated from videos from the home visits) moderate associations between early measures of adjustment and these later outcome measures.

Recent papers from this study include a Developmental Psychology article presenting longitudinal findings on Theory of Mind and Executive Function as predictors of children's social competencies; in addition, we have a paper on maternal mind-mindedness and conduct problems that is in revision</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings highlight the value of information that can be gained from 5-minute speech samples with mothers of pre-teenagers. Although these were gathered following face to face interviews, other studies (involving mothers of young children) have used phone calls to gather speech samples, which would further enhance the ease and efficiency of data-collection. Coding the speech samples for mind-mindedness requires some training, but we are confident that this could be completed by non-psychologists and are currently working with health visitors in Birkenhead in a screening programme to identify families in need of greater support. Although we have not engaged training studies ourselves, we believe that Liz Meins from York is working with the NSPCC in a study to increase mind-mindedness in young mothers with babies. Our findings suggest that a similar training programme could be valuable for mothers with older children. Finally, our findings regarding the strong overlap between escalating disruptive behaviour and negative academic trajectories in boys highlights the importance of a two-pronged approach in interventions for older children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DE0DFA54-6060-44F0-A327-95A853BC782D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461c9e2720501.91018208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://toddlersup.wix.com/toddlersup</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Dr Devine and Professor Hughes developed the Silent Film Task as a new measure for studying individual differences in mind reading skills in middle childhood and adolescence.
