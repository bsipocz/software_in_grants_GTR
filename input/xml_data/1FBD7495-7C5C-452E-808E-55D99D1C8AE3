Yet these rights were conceptually ambiguous, and their practical delivery was highly imperfect. In terms of reach, ambition and quality, and because of the particularity of its social rights, the world's first socialist-communist society seems to have generated a unique welfare system.

Yet to the extent that scholars have researched welfare in twentieth century Russia and the USSR, they have tended to emphasize not uniqueness but pan-European commonality, drawing particular attention to the shared bureaucratic practices that seem to structure welfare systems in all modern societies regardless of their ideological foundation. Scholars have also tended to emphasize what they see as the Soviet welfare system's incapacity and dysfunction. This research does not reject these arguments, but it does not assume them either. Instead, it starts from the hypothesis that twentieth-century Russia's 'welfare state' has been 'lost' in two different ways. First, it lacks detailed empirical study; this research thus addresses a surprisingly neglected area.

Second, the 'welfare state' seems lost because it might never have existed. It was either so feeble that it barely qualified as a welfare state, or so extensive that it became something else in kind: a total social project. Before the First World War, during the Stalin period, and again in the 1990s, Russian (or Soviet) welfare was exceptionally inadequate compared with welfare in other industrial societies. Yet between the 1950s and 1980s, in the years we most associate with Khrushchev and Brezhnev, welfare assumed an exceptional reach, concerning itself with many aspects of the lives of all citizens. Notwithstanding its patchy qualities, it apparently went far beyond what existed in liberal democracies at that time.

This hypothesis will be investigated across the span of the whole twentieth century. Of course, resources and time conspire against the writing of an equally detailed treatment of every aspect of this subject in every part of the century. To circumvent this problem, the project isolates four areas and explores them in particular detail, using archival sources where appropriate. These areas are the causes and consequences of the workers' insurance law of 1912; the institutionalization of social rights in the constitutions of 1936 and 1977; the pensions reforms of 1956 and 1964 (and especially their redefinition of the meaning of risk in post-Stalin society); and the history of the physical places in which welfare was delivered during the Khrushchev and Brezhnev years (such as pensions offices, urban microdistricts, and vacation sanatoria). Each of these aspects will be presented in a journal article, and together they will form the most precise empirical element in the book I plan to write.

The book will draw on these case studies, on more general research in published primary materials, and in extensive reading in a range of secondary sources, to position 'the lost welfare state of twentieth century Russia' in its proper European context. This will be the first time that the Russian example has been placed at the heart of a full-length study that pays sustained attention to international comparisons across the whole of the twentieth century. Through these comparisons, and through the judicious accretion of empirical detail, this study will make a major contribution to the history of welfare in twentieth century Russia and the USSR and, more generally, in twentieth century Europe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is an academic study that will be presented in an accessible way, and it is primarily designed to have an impact on scholars, students and general readers concerned with twentieth century Russia and the USSR, twentieth century Europe, and the history of welfare. That in itself represents a substantial potential impact. However, I will also seek to disseminate its findings still further, and to extend the reach of its impact in wider societal terms.

Firstly, I will aim to achieve impact in Russia itself. Written in English inside a British university, this study is unlikely to have much immediate impact on a scholarly or societal basis in Russia. By writing a scholarly article in Russian which summarizes my main arguments, and submitting it to one of the leading Russian historical journals, I would raise the profile of my work in Russia and might achieve unanticipated effects. In order proactively to generate interest beyond the academy, however, I propose to submit an article to one of the leading Russia-based policy-interest websites.

Secondly, this study should be of interest to policymakers and the interested public in the UK, not least because of its extensive concern with comparative history, and most directly because of those aspects which have particular contemporary resonance. Most obvious is the attention my research pays to the mechanisms which obliged Soviet citizens to participate themselves in the delivery of welfare policy. At times, these mechanisms served to increase citizens' autonomy as social actors, and at other times reflected a deliberate attempt to foster community-based ties outside the auspices of party or state. At the level of rhetoric and practice, revealing comparisons can be made, for example, between Khrushchev's social reforms and today's 'Big Society' initiative, which might throw light on both. Submissions to the 'History and Policy' website and the general political and cultural press are routes to achieving this impact.

Thirdly, I would like to target a general readership. The book itself will be written in an accessible style and will address questions of some breadth, so it should attract some general readers. But I would like to extend this readership by writing an article for one of the popular history monthlies. The sixtieth anniversary of Stalin's death falls in March 2013, which is an ideal moment to reach an interested public with a story about the significance of 1953 in Soviet history that they are unlikely to have heard. I would write an article about post-war Soviet social policy that shows which parts were designed before 1953 and which were implemented after that caesura, thus positioning a simplified version of some of my research in the context of wider scholarly debates about the overlap between the Stalinist and post-Stalin eras.
 
Fourthly, like many other colleagues, I am committed to increasing the public's critical awareness of the past. I speak regularly to groups of A level students and their teachers, as well as to other community-based groups. I intend to liaise with these contacts in order to offer general talks about my research to interested local audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27618</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J007595/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
