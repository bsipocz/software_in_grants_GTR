Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS). Climate change caused by increasing emissions of CO2, principally the burning of fossil fuels for power generation, is one of the most pressing concerns for society. Currently around 90% of the UK's energy needs are met by fossil fuels which will probably continue to be the predominant source of energy for decades to come. Developing our understanding of the pros and cons of a range of strategies designed to reduce CO2 emissions is vital. Of the available strategies such as wind, wave and solar renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) none are without potential problems or limitations. The concept of CCS simply put is to capture CO2 during the process of power generation and to store it permanently in deep geological structures beneath the land or sea surface. If CCS is successful existing fossil fuel reserves could be used whilst new forms of power generation with low CO2 emissions are developed. A few projects have been successfully demonstrating either capture or storage on limited scales, so it is established that the technical challenges are surmountable. Research is also demonstrating that the geological structures are in general robust for long term storage (for example oil deposits remain in place within geological strata). However geological structures are complex and natural sub surface gas deposits are known to outgas at the surface. Consequently it would be irresponsible to develop full scale CCS programmes without an understanding of the likelihood of leakage and the severity of impacts which might occur. The aim of this proposal is to greatly improve the understanding of the scale of impact a leakage from CCS systems might inflict on the ecosystem and to enable a comprehensive risk assessment of CCS. The main location of stored CO2 in the UK will be in geo-formations under the North Sea and our research concentrates on impacts to the marine environment, although our work will also be relevant to all geological formations. Research to date has shown that hypothetical large leaks would significantly alter sediment and water chemistry and consequently some marine creatures would be vulnerable. What is not yet understood is how resilient species are, and how big an impact would stem from a given leak. Our project will investigate for the first time the response of a real marine community (both within and above the sediments) to a small scale tightly controlled artificial leak. We will look at chemical and biological effects and importantly investigate the recovery time needed. We will be able to relate the footprint of the impact to the known input rate of CO2. The results will allow us to develop and test models of flow and impact that can be applied to other scenarios and we will assess a number of monitoring methods. The project will also investigate the nature of flow through geological formations to give us an understanding of the spread of a rising CO2 plume should it breach the reservoir. The work proposed here would amount to a significant advance in the understanding and scientific tools necessary to form CCS risk assessments and quantitative knowledge of the ecological impacts of leaks. We will develop model tools that can predict the transfer, fate and impact of leaks from reservoir to ecosystem, which may be applied when specific CCS operations are planned. An important product of our work will be a recommendation of the best monitoring strategy to ensure the early detection of leaks. We will work alongside interested parties from industry, government and public to ensure that the information we produce is accessible and effective.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>672463</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The QICS project involved a complex novel world-first experiment in which CO2 was injected below the sea floor to mimic a leak from CCS.

Within this a number of presentations covered the potential impacts of a leak from transported or geologically stored CO2 in terms of areal significance, chemical changes and biological consequences and then discussed best practice for monitoring and baseline studies. Finally discussions on follow-up research needs were conducted.
The activity was supported by the development of a range of media including project brochures, factsheets, and interviews.

As a result of this activity, the outputs of the QICS project have been used by both the FEED studies currently developing plans for full scale Carbon Capture and Storage in the UK. In particular the QICS project participants have been assisting Shell with the development of their environmental monitoring and impact plans.
The workshop has also generated stakeholder interest in a repeat experiment, and this has feed into a submission to the NERC SPAG.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544e24dde4af04.23559079</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bgs.ac.uk/qics/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FCO meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A42B349-B947-415E-9126-47FADCA8BA98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office meeting on Opportunities for future collaboration in CCS R&amp;amp;D, UK/China/Canada, Southampton 27th Sept 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d048df57fbd4.51728088</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at IEAGHG workshop: impact of sub-seabed CO2 leak on microbial activities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4BFAEC7-4881-4665-9A5D-3034CB569603</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at IEAGHG workshop: Risk Management Network &amp;amp; Environmental Research Network Meeting

This compares positively with, for example, the impact from trawling activities. We would suggest that even if the risk of small-scale leakage (i.e. fractions of a % of the volume stored) from CCS was significant then there would be little environmental impact concern. The second clear message from our research is that monitoring for small leakage fluxes of CO2 in the shallow sediments and water column is tractable. However because we saw a very large heterogeneity in the distribution of CO2 over small distances, monitoring systems will need to be very carefully designed to ensure they are both efficient and effective. Storage reservoirs cover an area of the order of 100km2 and the detectable signal of leakage may be spatially very restricted. Hence monitoring systems will have to be highly efficient and capable of covering large areas at a high resolution. We suggest a monitoring strategy initially based on anomaly detection, and only if anomalies are detected should more concentrated effort to confirm, attribute and quantify leakage be expended. No one method of detection is likely to suffice in all circumstances, a combination of chemical (pH) and acoustic (bubble plume) methods mounted on Autonomous Underway Vehicles will be needed. This work is now feeding into an ETI funded project designing AUVs and sensors as well as a Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Action project which will design baseline and monitoring strategies. The outputs and outcomes of QICS are detailed on the project website http://www.qics.co.uk, where most 'products' can be downloaded. The synthesis of outcomes from QICS has been published in Nature Climate Change, http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n11/full/nclimate2381.html. Twenty one research and synthesis have been published in a special issue of the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control volume 38, July 2015 ISSN:1750-5836. In the 6 months since publication this special issue has already accumulated 106 citations in other publications. We have developed a series of factsheets and a brochure, along with videos to aid the communication of our results to a non-specialist audience and held meetings to disseminate results to industrial, regulatory and other interested stakeholders. The outputs from QICS fed directly into both of the UK FEED studies for full scale CCS commercialization projects at Peterhead and White Rose, in particular assisting Shell to develop monitoring plans for the Peterhead project. Results from QICS were also presented as evidence to the London Convention meeting (Nov 2015). QICS results have been presented to interested stakeholders (including industry and government representatives) and scientists in Europe, Australia, Japan, China, South Korea and the US. The results and insights stemming from QICS are highly sought after internationally, with pilot CCS projects in the aforementioned countries actively seeking to interact with QICS and successor projects. QICS is therefore positioned to have international policy influence and has established an international scientific reputation and focus for future international collaboration. The QICS project will facilitate the development of CCS as a climate mitigation option.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E0BC4F00-923D-4437-A1F9-16B154EF63E7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-1829032974.1584444de2688bc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Whilst there is good evidence to suggest that carbon dioxide stored in deep geological strata as part of climate change mitigating carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations will be secure in the long term, leakage is at least theoretically possible. Regulatory legislation and the public require an understanding of the potential impacts of leakage and monitoring systems that are fit to detect leakage, or conversely, provide assurance that leakage is not occurring. Industry requires guidance as to effective and cost efficient monitoring strategies. Whilst primary monitoring will focus on the deep storage reservoir, the techniques used are unable to detect small anomalies over a kilometre below the surface. Thus near surface monitoring, where small fluxes can be detected, is a necessary component of a comprehensive monitoring strategy.

The NERC funded project &amp;quot;Quantifying and monitoring environmental impacts of carbon storage&amp;quot; (QICS) had two primary objectives, specifically to assess:
1. If leakage of CO2 from geological storage (or transport) occurred, would the environmental impact be significant?
2. What are the best methods to monitor for leakage (including detection and quantification) in the shallow sub-surface and water column?
Because carbon storage potential in the UK is located offshore, the project focussed on marine systems.

In order to answer these questions the QICS project developed a world-first experiment, injecting CO2 directly into marine sediments below the sea floor in a coastal bay, just north of Oban, Scotland. We did this in order to replicate as closely as possible, within pragmatic limits, what a real leakage event could look like at the sea floor. There are a number of reasons why a real world injection was advantageous. Firstly, little was known about how gas forms new pathways within sediments, secondly sediments have very distinct vertical gradients in terms of physical structure, chemistry and biological populations. Hence the impact of CO2 from below can be very distinct from that when CO2 is introduced from above. Thirdly, working in a real environment ensures that we see realistic dispersal of CO2 as driven by tides and currents once the CO2 reaches the water column and finally, the biological response depends on ecological interactions and behaviour that cannot be replicated in a laboratory setting. 

The key findings from QICS are:

1. The sediments acted as a buffer for leaking CO2, both by physical absorption into the pore spaces and subsequently by carbonate dissolution, a process that absorbs CO2. As a consequence of this, the expected increase in acidity of sediment pore water was partially restricted, moderating impacts. The presence of gas in the sediments could be clearly imaged by seismic techniques.

2. Only a fraction (~15%) of the injected CO2 escaped into the water column in the gas phase where it was clearly detectable using hydrophones to listen for bubbles. However we hypothesise that additionally significant dissolved phase flow occurred closely associated with the gas plumes. Significant changes in water chemistry were restricted to the area of outgassing, the CO2 was undetectable at a few 10s of metres distance. 

3. Some biological impacts were seen, there was a decrease in species numbers and biodiversity due to both emigration and mortality. However impacts were confined to the area within the bubble flow and the biology recovered within a few weeks of the injection ceasing.

4. We hypothesise that the sediment buffering, sea floor flux and impacts may change significantly for a longer term leak, if sediments become saturated with excess CO2.

As a result of our work we can make a very clear statement that small scale leakage from carbon storage would only impact a very small area and if short term, biological recovery would be rapid. We would suggest that even if the risk of small-scale leakage (i.e. a fraction of a % of the volume stored) from CCS was significant, there would be little environmental impact concern, especially contrasted with the threat of unmitigated climate change.

The second clear message from our research is that monitoring for small leakage fluxes of CO2 in the shallow sediments and water column is tractable. However because we saw a very large heterogeneity in the distribution of CO2 over small distances, and timescales, monitoring systems will need to be very carefully designed to ensure they are both efficient and effective. 

Storage reservoirs cover an area of the order of 100km2 and the detectable signal of leakage may be spatially very restricted (~10m). Hence monitoring systems will have to be capable of covering large areas at a high resolution. We suggest a monitoring strategy initially based on anomaly detection, and only if anomalies are detected should more concentrated effort to confirm, attribute and quantify leakage be expended. No one method of detection is likely to suffice in all circumstances, a combination of chemical (pH or pCO2) and acoustic (bubble plume) methods mounted on Autonomous Underway Vehicles is recommended. Understanding the natural variability or baseline of the marine system (e.g. biologically mediated pH variability, the presence of natural biogenic gas in the sediments) will be essential for effective and efficient monitoring.
