1) Academic teachers tasked with introducing social science undergraduate students to secondary data analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics (i.e. measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion and measures of association such as chi square, spearman's rho, t-tests, kendall's tau and pearson's r).

2) Undergraduate students who must complete a quantitative teaching module as a core part of their first-year degree course.

How will they benefit from this research?

The ESRC Quantitative Strategic Advisor (QSA) has made three key recommendations regarding the enhancement of quantitative teaching provision which can be mapped to the ERSC Quantitative Teaching Curriculum Innovation funding call (see table 1, case for support file, page 3 - 4). The data collected will enable the research team to evaluate if the following projected benefits have been realised in relation to these recommendations:

QSA Recommendation 1: 'To secure increased curriculum space for quantitative methods, including teaching in year 1 and more contact time for students'

A key output of the project will be development of a new quantitative methods and mapping technology teaching module that will extend first-year students' exposure to quantitative data analysis from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. It is assumed that enhancing the presence of quantitative teaching within the curriculum, including the support offered to students in the form of tutor contact and learning resources available to them via the mapping webspace, will have a positive impact on i) their general educational experience of learning quantitative methods given any initial anxiety they may have felt toward the topic ii) their quantitative data analysis skills, and iii) their perception of the role of quantitative research within the social sciences. Immediate evaluation of if students feel that they have indeed benefited in this manner will occur as part of the proposed data collection and analysis process. Longer term evaluation past the lifetime of the project is planned as part of the audit and quality control developmental cycle for undergraduate teaching provision within the School of Social, Geographical and Political Science at Loughborough University (see case for support). A key element of this longer term evaluation will be if the changes introduced have led to students choosing to undertake more statistically focused research project work in second and third year of their studies.

QSA Recommendation 2: 'To innovate in quantitative methods course content, with more emphasis on understanding and analysing data and proper treatment of secondary data analysis'.

The project seeks to innovate in the provision of quantitative teaching content through using mapping technology to introduce students to secondary data analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. Evaluation of if students feel that they have benefited from this approach will occur as part of the proposed data collection and analysis process.

QSA Recommendation 3: 'To ensure that staff are supported by good quality web resources.'

Teaching staff will benefit from activity relating to the development of an open-access online 'mapping webspace' containing learning and teaching resources on crime and social mapping, including links to mapping data from national data source archives i.e UK census data alongside published research concerning the application of mapping technology to social problems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76885</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Examining the Impact of  Visual Teaching and Learning Strategies  on Undergraduate Students Self-reported experience of  Quantitative Research Methods teaching:  Update from the Loughborough Project</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A620AAE8-B814-41E3-872B-A725B5738CB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at Workshop on Visualisation and QM Teaching organized by The Loughborough Project
