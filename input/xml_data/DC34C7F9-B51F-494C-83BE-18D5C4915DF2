Use</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K007807/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Brands are names, phrases, symbols or designs that identify particular products, which are often protected by trade marks. Trade marks help owners protect their reputation by forbidding use of their brand name by others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Trade marks are usually registered, but not all registered marks are used. Much litigation arises over the extent of use and reputation of marks, which often results in costly surveys being run.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to improve the measurement of brand value and the measurement of trade mark use by combining data from trade mark registers and data from Google's search products. Data from Google's search products can be used to measure value and use of marks. In using these data two important challenges must be overcome: heterogeneity of the data and attempts to manipulate the measures obtained. Both challenges will be addressed in the project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data on search are heterogeneous because the reasons for searches are heterogeneous, they may reflect positive or negative brand interest. Additionally, attempts to manipulate Google's rankings of websites though the PageRank link analysis algorithm are legion. To overcome both problems we will consider ways of limiting search terms to obtain consistent measures of value from Google's search products.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project we outline here may benefit businesses working with trade marks and brands as well as the courts, trade mark offices, trade mark lawyers and finally competition regulators. In developing this project we have been in contact with representatives of all of these groups to discuss our ideas as is outlined in the Pathways to Impact attachment. Here we briefly discuss how each group might benefit separately.

Currently the valuation of intangible assets such as brands and technological innovations as well as the intellectual property rights associated with those assets (trade marks and patents) is very complex and requires a great deal of expertise. This project will provide the first attempt to deliver reliable estimates of market value for trade mark stocks of a wide range of different firms in the United Kingdom and in Chile. These will make it easier for those buying and selling such assets, to derive values that are connected to the markets' evaluations of such assets.

Trade marks are frequently the object of litigation and it has recently been shown that such litigation is on the rise in the United States. The number of trade mark opposition cases heard at trade mark offices far outstrips the number of court cases. In many of these cases the use of one or more trade marks or the question whether a trade mark is well known are at the heart of the case. Currently, evidence that is brought to bear in such cases relies on surveys of consumers and evidence of use brought by the parties. This project will deliver a methodology to obtain data on use and extent of use by jurisdiction or territory from data collected and made available by Google. This data might then be used by the courts and trade mark offices to supplement the types of evidence already considered. The advantage of such data obtained from Google is that it would be comparatively cheaper than a survey of consumers.

Finally, our methodology will allow us to study the effects of mergers and merger related divestitures of brands on brand value. This question is of interest to competition regulators, which are seeking to reduce the anticompetitive effects of mergers by forcing firms to sell off parts of their businesses. It is currently difficult for competition regulators to establish whether brands that have been divested continue to thrive under new ownership in such a way as to fulfill their intended role.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Padova</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Economics Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>Visiting PhD Student</gtr:description><gtr:id>A014F7BF-8D21-4B21-89AF-C4E6744D1E47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Firm level data based on the EU Scoreboard.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd792723cee4.69979957-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sending of the visiting PhD student who is working on data and two papers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Training of a visiting PhD student.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Queen's School of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Data exchange with Eddie Wilson (Bristol)</gtr:description><gtr:id>761F32DC-3B1F-4D05-9666-C4F14C1F41B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Draft working paper.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7a9a4049b8.43489099-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of paper and expertise.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have used the data to jointly write a paper.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Commission</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Joint Research Centre (JRC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Data exchange with JRC - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>5265B20A-0AB9-4886-A04F-CA6B3973DDDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work on a paper is ongoing.

We presented at a working party meeting of OECD in December 2014.

We interacted with a number of company representatives in the transport sector who were also exploring the use of data from Google Trends and have presented our work to researchers working on related projects in finance.

We have supervised a number of Master Theses using the data and have started to extend research to further topics in marketing through these theses.

The first draft of the first working paper was submitted for review in August 2016. We have presented the paper at a number of conferences on big data topics world wide.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7F360CEC-507B-492E-9846-355EB3895B35</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>565b309f7fc567.33326978</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to investigate whether data from Google Trends could be used to value brands. Currently brand valuation methods are highly complex and results are generally not available for many brands and are not comparable across brands.

We downloaded Google Trends data for brands in the automotive sector and for the brands of listed companies. The data were then joined to other data about the firms and brands we collected from public sources. Analysis of this data showed that:

1) Google Trends data provides a good measure of changes to brand value for well established brands with national or global reach in the automotive sector. The data capture changes in brand value that are the result of exogeous shocks, .e.g as a result of product recalls.

2) Google Trends data also contain information about variation in stock market value of listed companies that is not contained in data released through firms' quarterly and annual reports or in other publicly avialable data on intellectual property rights and citations of these rights.

3) Using Google Trends data for brand valuation requires that researchers and analysts pay attention to the time series properties of the data. The levels of serial correlation in the data are high and unit roots and unobserved common factors are often present.

4) Google Trends data can be usefully complemented with data from other sources such as Wikipedia for the purposes of brand valuation.

5) Analysis of Google Trends data joined to other longitudianl data requires that great care is taken with respect to the modeling of serial correlation, order of integration of the data and onobserved common factors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have completed the first working paper on predicting sales using Google data. This has been presented at 8 international conferences and seminars (2x USA, 2x France, 2x Germany, 1x Portugal, 1x UK) and is on the program for two more conferences. The paper has been under review for 6 months at a top 5 economics journal.

We have just completed an improved version of the firm-level data for the second paper on market value and are now moving to update our Google Trends data for this work.

We anticipate that non-academic users will use data from Google Trends to evaluate marketing campaigns and brand value. This is likely to take place across all industries that rely heavily on brands to support communication with customers, employees and suppliers.

We already have some feedback from industry suggesting that this use of data from Google Trends is being actively investigated.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74EB7B0C-288A-4593-8969-65C155E57593</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54b7dde5023124.97646445</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2832004</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training of PhD Students</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB59F085-3F1A-4C06-8E5C-B2B48F1885E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>565b34c7e3cba2.52112940</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training of MSc Students</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE6A4855-3522-4FF2-9A0D-07704D5F1BFD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>565b351e79f076.41898538</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have linked data obtained from the JRC - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Unit Knowledge for Growth - to data on patents from PATSTAT and data from OHIM's register of EU trade marks.
