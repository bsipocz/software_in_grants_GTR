The problem is very attractive in modeling real-world problems involving two levels of decision-making. Problems in economics, engineering, health, environmental sciences and other areas of mathematics have been successfully modeled using the bilevel paradigm. Mathematically, the main issue with the structure of the problem is that part of the feasible set of the upper-level problem is defined by the solution map of the lower-level problem. Because of this, the standard optimization theory and the corresponding numerical methods are not applicable. For instance, in the process of constructing a Newton method in standard nonlinear optimization, constraint qualifications are needed to ensure that the method is well-defined. Standard constraint qualifications systematically fail for bilevel optimization problems. 

The Newton method is one of the most powerful techniques to solve nonlinear system of equations. Over the years, it has been successfully extended to various classes of optimization and closely related problems. The method is the base of a large number of commercial and open source optimization software, and is crucial in solving subproblems in popular algorithms such as augmented Lagrangian and interior point methods. Considering this success in other areas of optimization, we will be proposing cutting-edge techniques, which once combined with the Newton scheme, will lead to efficient algorithms for the bilevel optimization problem. 

Precisely, we will develop a semismooth Gauss-Newton method and a semismooth Newton-type method to compute the weak and strong stationary points, respectively. We will also construct a general purpose solver based on these two methods. In the process, important gaps in the literature on bilevel optimization will be filled, including the development of second order sufficient conditions and approximation schemes allowing constraint qualifications to be fulfilled. The continuous optimization community will benefit from the Hessian consistency property that will be introduced and studied in the context of the approximation of the lower-level value function, in the process of constructing the semismooth Newton-type method. The Hessian consistency property will be crucial for the construction of (general) nonsmooth optimization Newton-type methods, for which work is still at an early stage. The development of the Gauss-Newton-type method will provide the optimization and numerical analysis communities with new paths for solving non-square nonsmooth systems of equations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Newton's method is one of the most successful methods for nonlinear optimization problems and it has been successfully extended to various classes of optimization and closely related problems. This method has not yet been explored in the context of bilevel optimization. The PI, jointly with Prof. A. Fischer, has conducted a preliminary analysis on the method, which shows that it can successfully work in the context of bilevel optimization provided the hierarchical structure of the problem is properly dealt with. With the PI's extensive experience on bilevel optimization optimality conditions theory and stability analysis, we will propose cutting-edge techniques, which once combined with the Newton scheme, will lead to efficient algorithms for the bilevel optimization problem.

While leading to new discoveries in numerical and variational analysis, this project provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen the UK's position in continuous optimization. The 2010 International Review of Mathematical Sciences stated that ``UK researchers represent excellence in continuous, stochastic and combinatorial optimisation''. Continuous optimization is part of the ``Mathematical Aspects of Operational Research'', which are currently a priority area for EPSRC. Research on bilevel optimization is already gaining attention with UK academics as shown by recent publications on the subject in top scientific journals. But the attention has not yet reached the level that will allow the country to play a world leading role in cutting edge research in this area. For such an ambitious goal to be achieved, more funding will be needed. This will subsequently allow the taxpayer to benefit from the innovative solutions that bilevel optimization offers to deal with some major societal and economic challenges.

The main results will be published in three 4* publications with existing open access policy (e.g., SIAM Journal on Optimization, cf. https://www.siam.org/journals/oa.php) or supported by the University of Southampton (e.g., relevant Springer journals). Final versions of the papers will also be made freely available via https://arxiv.org/, http://www.optimization-online.org/ and Southampton's repository, http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/. A key deliverable of this project will be the first general purpose solver for bilevel optimization, that will be made available on the PI's webpage and in one of the dedicated open source toolboxes, e.g., YALMIP (http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/), which is designed for MATLAB packages. 

Thanks to the excellent framework offered by CORMSIS, our industrial impact will involve a multi-pronged approach to make sure that the results of this project will benefit the UK's transportation industry (collaboration with Transport for London on congestion changer and demand estimation via Sandra Weddell, Modelling Manager), healthcare system (new methodological framework for treatment adherence, with collaboration from FHI 360 via Dr. E.M. Kabaso), as well as the rapidly growing field of data science (leveraging with contacts at Babcok International, FlyBe and Jet2).

This project will enable us to provide crucial training for a PDRA; he/she will have the opportunity to work in one of the top OR research centres in the UK (CORMSIS). He/she will also have the opportunity to further skills in multidisciplinary collaboration and international research, as our project will involve visits to the Technical University of Dresden (Germany), as well as the universities of Edinburgh and Lancaster. The PDRA will be able to expand his/her expertise in hierarchical, nonconvex, nonsmooth and computational optimization. His presentation experience will also be developed with talks on the results of this project at international conferences, workshops and seminars. All these skills will enable him/her to develop a competitive research profile for future academic and industrial work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100929</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P022553/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0F2F1A7-287A-4B6F-AA0E-74A55BB4DEE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Aspects of OR</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
