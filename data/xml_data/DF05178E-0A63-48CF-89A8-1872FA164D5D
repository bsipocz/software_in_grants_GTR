And what is writing about restaurants for?\n\nRestaurants are complex phenomena: they are at once economic institutions and social texts; they are at once sites of consumption, where certain needs are accommodated and a system of needs is promoted, and fields of dreams, where cultural fantasies are hatched, circulated, and maybe even fulfilled. I have been concerned with the phenomenon of the modern restaurant partly in the wake of my 2006 book, Aguecheek's Beef, about food, culture, and literature in the early modern period. One thing that is not found in the period up to 1740 is the restaurant, which has its origins (in Paris) a few decades later. So to explore the transition from early modern to modern responses to food one has to account for the invention of the restaurant. But I have also been concerned with the modern restaurant because of own fieldwork observing contemporary restaurants in the UK and abroad, and because of my own study of writing about food and restaurants in the modern and postmodern eras.\n\nRestaurants are a happy subject to write about; and any study of modern restaurants, unless it focuses on weighty topics like the spread of obesity and environmentally abusive food supply practices, runs the danger of seeming, somehow, not serious enough. I court that danger in this study, moreover, by writing a book that is meant to find a public beyond the specialists in modern food studies, and to try to have an impact on public awareness. The aim of this project is to complete a book to be entitled Restaurants for the Rest of Us, under contract with Reaktion Books, for delivery in April of 2010, with an initial press run of 2500 copies. But the danger a writer may face in tackling such a subject is also part of the problem. In the English-speaking world, we have a problem of discourse when it comes to food practices. Restaurants are vital to the cosmopolitan culture that all major urban areas in the UK and around the globe aspire to as a matter of social policy. But the English-speaking world has a bad conscience when it comes to cosmopolitanism, consumption, pleasure, and culture. Even the French-speaking world (which I shall also discuss) has problems with these topics. That difficulty hearkens back to the first writings about restaurants in the early eighteenth century; it continues in fields as diverse as existentialist and postmodernist philosophy, Anglo-American sociology, modern restaurant criticism, and the modern novel.\n\nIn this study I explore a variety of different ways of writing about restaurants, and explain the barriers to 'good faith' -- the opposite of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'bad faith' -- to thinking about restaurants that appears in each of them. The text will include a study of Grimod de la La Reyni&amp;egrave;re (1758-1837), the first restaurant critic; a discussion of Sartre; a discussion of restaurant reviewing; and a comparative analysis of four sample novels, from William Morris's News from Nowhere (1890) to Anne Tyler's Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant (1893). In all, this study provides a snapshot of how restaurants have entered into the discourse of the West, and how, nevertheless, we have still yet to come to terms with them.\n\nModern writing about restaurants, especially in Britain, tends to imagine restaurants as something outside -- outside national tradition, outside the home, outside the self, and even outside morality. In this study, however, I intend to show that the restaurant is very much inside all of us. At least, the 'restaurant for the rest of us' is.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H003371/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD9F0C26-AA57-4235-8010-AEBAF429C756</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
