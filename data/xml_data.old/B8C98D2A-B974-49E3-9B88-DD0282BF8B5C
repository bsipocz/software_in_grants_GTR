The first addresses the meaning of modern slavery. It is a study and analysis of how slavery is defined by different 'user groups', with the intention of bringing usability and clarity, and perhaps conformity and agreement, to the different needed types of definitions - specifically legal, operational, and popular definitions. This study also will bring the perspective of the antislavery usable past by asking how formerly enslaved people who became antislavery leaders during past abolitionist movements (18th, 19th and 20th century) understood and used definitions (and measurements) of slavery in their autobiographies, speeches, editorials and other antislavery advocacy. Does the definitional debate, especially with regard to contributions by survivors of slavery, have a usable past? How did former slaves who led past abolitionist campaigns debate and utilize definitions and measurements? A key part of this side of the research will be to bring the perspective and participation of contemporary survivors of slavery into the study through collecting survivor narratives first hand and introducing topics of definition into new interviews with survivors. 

The second key activity of this project addresses the measurement of modern slavery. It is a further test of the application of Multiple Systems Estimation techniques to the hidden population of slavery and trafficking victims, this time in the regional setting of Central Florida, USA, as a case study. The PI and the non-academic partner recently pioneered the first ever use of this technique in addressing slavery and trafficking crime in the UK with the result of the government altering their basis for policy and planning. In Central Florida, working with our NGOs, governmental, and law enforcement partners, the study will replicate the technique as a further test and demonstration. It will also broaden this methodological research in two ways. Firstly, a journalist will be embedded into the MSE research process, exploring and interpreting the experiences of the participants to a wider audience, Secondly, as with our first sub-project, survivors of slavery/trafficking will take a key role in this research. We designed and planned the project in collaboration with two slavery survivors</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>For the sub-project on definitions and meaning the sought after impact of this sub-project is, admittedly, audacious. For the past twenty years much forward movement in this field has been blocked by conflicts over definitions. Conferences, planning meetings, potential collaborations, even the drafting and enactment of laws, have foundered at early stages because definitions could not be agreed. While this work may not fully resolve this conflict, it is hoped that it might break the existing logjam, and allow a more free-flowing movement toward debate and consensus. The impact of this will be felt in two key areas: firstly, the large number of existing legal definitions in national laws and international instruments which are not in harmony or contradictory, will be addressed by building a template definition. We are under no illusions that previous definitions now enacted as law will be scraped, but there is the possibility over time of amendment under the pressure of resolving jurisdictional disagreement. Part of this work with legal definitions is linked to the previous AHRC-funded project which led to the promulgation of the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines on the legal definition of slavery. Secondly, there will be work in parallel to legal definition to develop an operational definition for use within the social sciences. Across the social sciences, whether involving the use of qualitative or quantitative methods, an inability to fix on and operationalise a definition of slavery means that little comparative or common research has been accomplished - a situation very rare amongst the study of other crimes or human activities. Resolving to use a shared operational definition, even amongst sub-set of researchers, would make possible the critical and needed step of research that can be compared 'like with like'. This is not to assert that all research might fall into common agreement on subject matter and definition, the study of crimes such as rape or hate crime are sometimes divided by definitional debate, but this is a healthy process, and not like the broad and contentious debate now affecting the study of slavery. 

The impact of the sub-project testing and demonstrating Multiple Systems Estimation will be threefold. Firstly, just as the recent first use of MSE provided a more reliable estimation of slavery crime in the UK which then served as the basis for a re-think of government policy and enforcement, we intend that the same be true for those enforcing law, making policy, and serving survivors in Florida. Secondly, virtually all grounded planning and progress in this field, particularly in the developed countries, has been blocked by reliable prevalence estimates, and the impact of such a demonstration and dissemination of MSE would likely ripple out to other jurisdictions. Thirdly, the participation of the journalist's is intended to spread the concept and possibility of this technique more widely (at the moment it is only known to a handful of statistical specialists). The aim of this being that virtually all jurisdictions within the developed countries lack reliable measures of slavery/trafficking crime, and so lack a basis on which to build policy, budgets, and adequate responses. A key impact aim is to hasten the process of interest, understanding, and adoption of this technique across these countries and jurisdictions. 

The impact aim that applies to both of these research activities is the active engagement of survivors of slavery/trafficking in the process of definitional analysis and in the building of the multiple systems estimate. It is difficult to know how best to measure this impact, but the idea of defining a criminal act which does not include the perspective of victims of that crime seems inadequate. We believe that survivor participation will improve the quality and depth of both research exercises.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P001491/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
