It is caused by the immune system attacking the body?s own tissues. People with PBC frequently experience profound fatigue or tiredness which they liken to their ?batteries running down?, and although people still want to undertake normal activities they simply lack the energy to be able to do them. This reduces quality of life, makes it difficult for people to work, and can end up with them becoming isolated in the community. At present we have no treatment for fatigue in PBC. Finding a treatment for fatigue in PBC is one of the highest research priorities identified by patient groups. We have shown that PBC patients with fatigue have an abnormality in the way they generate energy within their muscles. This appears to be associated with the presence of an antibody in the blood which is directed against an important protein which normal cells in the body use to generate energy. In recent years new drug treatments have been developed which allow us to safely suppress the part of the immune system which produces antibodies of the type that seem to cause energy production problems in PBC. As yet, however, the extent to which these medicines can improve fatigue through removal of antibodies in PBC has not been tested. The aim of this study is to undertake a clinical trial to examine the effects of this treatment (?Rituximab?) on severe fatigue in PBC to help us understand whether this will be a potentially useful treatment. The information this will give us about how energy generation changes in patients with PBC with and without the treatment will also help us to develop new treatments for fatigue in other diseases. The study has the potential to improve the quality of life of many patients with PBC, for whom there is currently no hope of improvement. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of Rituximab therapy in PBC compared to placebo with the primary end point of fatigue severity. The study will be performed in a specialised PBC clinical centre. Money is requested for the costs of the treatment, the staff to carry out the assessment of patients and supervise the safe and successful completion of the trial, and also for the laboratory and body-scanning costs. We have, for many years, worked closely with PBC patient groups to focus on the problems that are important to our patients. This proposal reflects these close links and is fully supported by LiverNorth, a liver disease charity and patient support group.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BACKGROUND: Patients with the primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) experience profound fatigue for which there is no treatment. Fatigued PBC patients describe impaired muscle function related to abnormality in cellular bioenergetics related to the presence of serum antibodies reactive with pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key mitochondrial energy generating enzyme. The function of PDH in vitro is inhibited by PDH-reactive antibodies purified from the serum of PBC patients. Proof-of-concept studies have shown that B-cell depleting therapy (Rituximab) reduces fatigue in PBC. HYPOTHESIS &amp;amp; AIMS: We hypothesise that the bioenergetic abnormality underpinning fatigue in PBC is a direct consequence of the in vivo actions of anti-PDH antibody. Our aim is to explore the efficacy of Rituximab in reducing fatigue severity in PBC through reduction in the release of anti-PDH and related antibodies, and associated normalisation of muscle energy generation function. This study will advance both the treatment of severe fatigue in PBC and provide insights into the role played by anti-PDH antibody in the pathogenesis of fatigue in PBC which will inform the further improvement of treatment for this important symptom. DESIGN &amp;amp; POPULATION: A double-blind, randomized, parallel group placebo-controlled clinical trial supported by an accredited CTU, performed in confirmed PBC patients with severe fatigue (PBC-40 fatigue domain score &amp;gt; 35) recruited from a specialist disease clinic. INTERVENTIONS: Rituximab therapy in comparison to placebo (Rituximab 1,000 mg iv on days 1 and 15) in patients fully established on conventional treatment (ursodeoxycholic acid). OUTCOMES: Primary: Fatigue severity assessed using the fatigue domain of the PBC-40, a fully validated disease-specific quality of life measure. Secondary: a) Clinical: 1) Safety, 2) Improvement in non-fatigue domains of PBC-40 (itch, cognitive, social &amp;amp; emotional), 3) Functional capacity (Improved-HAQ), 4) Time-course of benefit, 5) Patient perceptions of effect, 6) Level of physical activity, 7) liver biochemistry. b) Mechanistic: 1) Functional MRI-based and exercise physiology approaches to explore the mechanisms of observed effects in terms of bioenergetics and muscle acidosis, 2) Immunological (antibody and B-cell assessments to confirm biological effectiveness). ASSESSMENTS: Detailed clinical fatigue, physiological and mechanistic assessment at weeks 0 and 12. Clinical assessment 3 monthly to 12 months. Clinical and safety assessments the day following treatments and weekly throughout the study. SAMPLE SIZE: 78 subjects randomized to 2 groups (Rituximab &amp;amp; placebo). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary outcome will be analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the basis of intention to treat. Secondary outcomes which are continuous in nature will be analysed by ANCOVA and the use of correlation coefficients to explore the relationship between physiological/immunological measurements and fatigue. ECONOMIC BENEFIT: PBC affects c20,000 patients in the UK, many of whom are unable to work, leading to significant social security costs, and all of whom require follow-up. Amelioration of fatigue would result in significant economic benefits.
