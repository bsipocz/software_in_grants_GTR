(ACTUAL)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/G029938/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Most of the world's population now lives in cities, which are already responsible for 80% of the world's carbon emissions. London's energy use soared during the 2003 heatwave - such extreme temperatures are predicted to be a regular occurrence by the 2050s. Our ageing urban infrastructure needs transformation to withstand the 21st century climate, without worsening it by increased use of energy. But buildings in urban areas don't just withstand local climate: they change it. This interaction is not generally recognised by engineers and planners working to transform urban infrastructure, partly because the science on which design standards are based does not incorporate understanding of urban climate. Adaptation of existing and new buildings to withstand warmer futures sustainably needs both legislation and standards - but policy cannot be formulated without evidence. Planning for sustainable cities on the basis of local climate has been hampered by lack of representative data. This is partially due to the difficulties of making representative full-scale measurements in urban areas with traditional, ground-based methods. Remote sensing techniques - using lasers and sound pulses to probe the air above the buildings at a distance - can provide a cutting-edge solution to the problem. The aim of this proposal is create the Advanced Climate Technology Urban Atmospheric Laboratory (ACTUAL), consisting of the tools to monitor and simulate urban climate from city down to building scale; and to integrate results directly into engineering and policy areas which transform urban infrastructure. The Core Project will be to build ACTUAL, requiring considerable development of instrumentation and data logging systems, with the goal of providing robust, representative climate data for London within 5 years. The research theme over the first five years is sustainable adaptation of buildings to a warmer London climate. Three interlinked Research Strands will exploit ACTUAL data within this theme: 1) improving urban climate simulation 2) assessing the effect of building layout on city ventilation and 3) developing tools to optimise urban renewable energy generation. The project brings together a diverse selection of engineers, meteorologists, local authority policy makers, and engineering consultants. Ensuring clear knowledge exchange between these areas is essential: so throughout the project a Virtual Urban Environment will be developed (City-VUE). This consists of integrated web-based and virtual educational activities to engage schools, the public, policy makers and engineers. ACTUAL and City-VUE will become key resources for engineers to underpin sustainable transformation of other aspects of urban infrastructure into the 21st century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1023187</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Arup</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB063ED0-CD17-47CB-AB39-B839AC7892AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PhD thesis, publications in preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda6959a51d5.27339824-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CASE PhD supervision, attendance at Project Advisory Group meetings</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CASE award PhD studentship thesis, wind tunnel work to verify numerical model of urban heat exchange with buildings, for future development of Arup's modelling tools</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Meteorological Office UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Met Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>58D81F42-95B6-4E5E-8D9E-78AA47C530C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2014 PhD thesis; publications in preparation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda3c8680cb9.30440712-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>CASE award PhD supervision; ongoing interaction with Met Office staff about national strategy in Urban Meteorology, through occasional MO Urban Working Group meetings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Testing different configurations of Met Office Unified Model (UKV) weather forecast model/numerical weather prediction - including operational and research versions - against data collected in London from EPSRC-funded ACTUAL project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>News articles</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5D81C06-D072-4926-A403-06F860005E17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2013, 20th April - contribution to New Scientist article &amp;quot;Oases of Cool&amp;quot;

Cities and towns are already responsible for over 70% of the world's energy-related carbon emissions. The city of London is home to 8.17 million residents and hosts 800,000 commuting workers per day (2011 data) leading to heavy energy demand (152,000 GWh of energy was consumed by the city in 2008). The urban heat island effect means that cities are generally warmer than rural areas and take longer to cool down overnight. During heatwaves, such as summer 2003, the temperature difference between the urban and rural areas becomes significant and energy demand for air conditioning dramatically increases. Climate model projections indicate that extreme temperatures will become a regular occurrence by the 2050s. We need to transform London's ageing urban infrastructure to withstand the 21st century climate, but improvements must be made with energy efficiency and the urban climate in mind.
Changing the urban environment to suit a warmer climate is not a one-way process. Buildings in urban areas don't just withstand local climate: they change it. This interaction is not generally recognised by engineers and planners working to transform urban infrastructure, partly because the science on which design standards are based does not incorporate understanding of urban climate. Sustainable design of new structures and adaptation of existing buildings for a warmer future needs both legislation and standards - but policy cannot be formulated without evidence. Planning for sustainable cities on the basis of local climate has been hampered by lack of representative data. This is partially due to the difficulties of making representative full-scale measurements in urban areas with traditional, ground-based methods. ACTUAL delivers a platform for the development of remote sensing techniques to provide a cutting-edge solution to the problem.

This grant has allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of urban climate processes at a range of spatial scale from an individual building up to the city scale. Data has been made available on our website and has received numerous requests from both inside and outside of academia. Specific stakeholder contact has included:
1) The UK Met Office, through a CASE award, has used our results in the development and validation of the 1 km grid version of the Unified Model (UKV) over urban areas. This should improve the forecasting of small-scale weather events and processes relating specifically to urban areas such as the urban heat island. Contact continues through the MO Urban Working Group. This has wide impact for downstream users of forecasters, as well as being of interest to the wind engineering community in terms of improved wind data sources. Results have been disseminated more widely to policy makers and practioners dealing with healthy city policies in Hong Kong (2014) and Australia (CSIRO event, 2012)
2) Research from this grant was used to produce a 'map' of wind speeds across central London and test various models used by the wind renewable energy sector. Dissemination to the wind engineering community through a prestige lecture at the European and African Conference on Wind Engineering (EACWE, 2013, Cambridge).
3) Air flow in and around an empty building in London was studied in detail. The infiltration rates were calculated and compared to models used by industry to predict infiltration. This was disseminated to professional practitioners through a Chartered Institute for Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) event in 2014, and to emergency response and air quality practioners/policymakers/scientists through an event organised by the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling Liaison Committee in 2013.
4) Arup have benefited directly from PhD work by Wagner Nogueira-Neto on improving their ability to model thermal comfort by their Outdoor-ROOM model. Wind tunnel experiments were used to study more complex building arrays, and simple mathematical formulations were included in the model.
Other results and impacts are ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7D835F29-2A82-40AB-9509-9532CA6EA5CB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545750811ab715.91147369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>To be completed - our key findings (and papers) include:
1) (Drew et al. 2013, Lane et al. 2013): To design tall buildings in urban areas, engineers need to estimate the forces which will be exerted on the structure by the wind during in its lifetime. To achieve this, an accurate representation of the wind speed profile in strong wind conditions is required. This is typically provided by wind engineering tools, which translate measurements collected at a nearby reference rural site. However, due to a lack of meteorological observations in urban areas, there has been little validation of these models. As part of the ACTUAL project (Advanced Climate Technology Urban Atmospheric Laboratory) a pulsed Doppler lidar has been installed on the rooftop of the WCC building in central London to obtain wind speed profile data for a long observation period. This data has been used to assess the accuracy the wind engineering tools. When applied to the multiple changes in surface roughness identified using the morphological approach, the non-equilibrium wind speed profile model developed by Deaves (1981) provides a good representation of the urban wind speed profile. For heights below 500 m, the predicted wind speed remains within the 95% confidence interval of the measured data. However, when the surface roughness is estimated using land use as a proxy, the model tends to overestimate the wind speed, particularly for very high wind speed periods. These results highlight the importance of a detailed assessment of the nature of the surface when estimating the wind speed above an urban surface.

2) (Barlow et al. 2014, Halios et al. 2014) Amongst the meteorological characteristics that describe the status of the lower atmosphere where humans live, Mixing Height (MH) and wind turbulence are of importance. MH represents the height reached by pollutants after release from sources at ground-level. Apart from pollution levels, the surface and air temperature we experience at the ground relate with the MH. Because the urban surface becomes hotter than rural, the air parcels rise higher in the urban environment and thus the urban MH is higher than rural MH. During a case study we found that urban MH is 3 times higher than rural MH. Buildings are also affected by wind fluctuations which could vary with height; wind variations could make the building vibrate. In ACTUAL we study wind turbulence in the urban environment using a Doppler lidar.

3) (Lane, 2014) Accurate urban weather forecasts are important for activities like winter road gritting, air quality forecasts and flood warnings. In order to verify these forecasts there must be extensive observations in cities for comparison with the model. ACTUAL observations have been used to validate the Met Office's UK forecasting model. During sunny, calm conditions leading to strong urban heat islands, the model tends to underestimate surface heat fluxes and mixing heights. This could impact on surface temperature predictions, leading potentially to over-prediction. Changing the representation/parametrization of the physics of heat transfer between the city and the atmosphere improves the simulations.

4) (Nogueira-Neto, 2015) The study of turbulent heat transfer from urban surfaces is still a relatively new subject, which aims to quantify and parameterize heat fluxes for different urban morphologies. This is important for prediction of thermal performance of buildings, and thermal comfort. One of the units of the urban morphology, the street canyon, is perhaps the best understood morphology in terms of its flow dynamics. This study has quantified how well the streets within cities are ventilated, how the wind affects thermal comfort and has found simple ways to represent these quantities numerically with Arup's Outdoor-ROOM. The work has used a wind tunnel to generate data to quantify these parameters and modified simple mathematical models to find what influence different shapes can have on heat transfer, i.e. different roof shape.

5) (Brocklehurst, 2014) Much of London's older building stock may struggle to improve energy efficiency. One of several factors which will lead to higher energy use is the rate of air exchange between indoors and outdoors, particularly in older less air-tight buildings. Unintentional air exchange through cracks in building fabric is defined as infiltration. This work aims to measure the infiltration rate in a real urban building in response to local meteorological conditions so as to be able to assess what causes higher infiltration and compare to simulations. Results have found that wind direction is a strong determinant of infiltration rate in an urban area, as well as windspeed, which is currently used in Building Energy Model formulations. Simple models of windspeed within the urban canopy have been tested against windtunnel results, some showing some skill in improving prediction of infiltration.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To be completed - but including:
