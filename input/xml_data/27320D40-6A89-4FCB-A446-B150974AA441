What was the real significance of the emergence of literature as a distinct, autonomous discipline as part of this process? My cross-disciplinary project studies the controversies and tensions that vexed and defined authorial identity in France across the long sixteenth century (1492-1635). It will reveal that the universalist 'Republic of Letters' - in which hard work, meticulous method, and careful erudition could in theory earn you a place - is a historical fantasy, an ideal in conflict with exclusionary writing cultures which tied legitimacy to social status and the possession of qualities (judgement, good sense, restraint) that an author was deemed to own simply by the good fortune of being well-born.

The legacies of humanist reading and writing practices meant that sixteenth-century writers frequently spent as much time compiling, editing, translating, and commentating as they did composing. These multiple roles were complemented by a polymathy that led writers to move back and forth between genres and disciplines, earning them any number of titles: 'grammaticus', 'man of letters', 'polygraph', 'polymath', 'editor', 'translator', 'commentator', 'compiler', 'hack', 'poet', 'rhymester', 'historian', 'cosmographer', 'romancer'. These labels, more common at this time than the catch-all title 'writer', were neither neutral nor equal; authors energetically laid claim to some and vigorously contested others, while sneeringly applying those they rejected to rivals. The gentleman-poet Guillaume des Autelz convicted his socially inferior opponent, Louis Meigret, of being a 'vulgar translator', with language reeking of the tavern; Meigret himself cast the socially approved 'gens des lettres' as pedestrian pedants, so in thrall to the ancients that they stifled their own voices; scholars with prestigious university posts saw individual authorship as dilettantism, a lack of commitment to the collaborative, impersonal pursuit of learning. Driving the claims and refutations of these scholars, hacks, and gentlemen were the dual questions of what an author working in the field of 'letters' had to know, do, or be - and who it was that he (only rarely she) had to know in order to win legitimacy.

Writers of this period are always themselves intensive and active readers of other works, ancient and modern. However, they also put great energy into publicly commending or critiquing fellow or rival writers' skills as readers (and thus their right to be writers), in terms profoundly informed by social, political, and confessional judgement. At the heart of my project is the analysis of how a series of longstanding intellectual quarrels played out in the particular historical and cultural contexts of Renaissance France. These debates pitted inspiration against originality, Latin against the vernacular, plagiarism against copyright, historical method and textual authority against empiricism, patronage against independence. They define my project's multi-genre, multi-author corpus, which mixes the canonic and the lesser-known, the metropolitan and the provincial. By combining literary techniques of close reading with archival research into the status and activities of writers in France's different publishing centres and associated with its emergent cultural institutions, the project promises to help us eavesdrop on the voices of a neglected Renaissance constituency. This literary 'middling sort' belonged neither to the prestigious pan-European, hyper-literate class of Renaissance humanists, nor to the much-studied artisanal class; these were writers who lived (or tried to live) by pen and print and their claims, counter-claims, and controversies reveal much about the politics of Renaissance authorship, judgement, and taste.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My project will have significant cultural impact on a range of beneficiaries beyond the academic world, in the UK but also in France. 

Firstly, public constituencies, such as local history groups, members of the University of the Third Age (U3A), and sixth formers studying history and/or languages will be able to get involved with the project through a series of three public 'lecture-debates'. These will combine a talk by me, followed by responses from invited public figures (public servants, writers, curators, politicians, publishers, media professionals), with a debate, open to the floor, exploring the role and value of the arts and humanities in society today, as expressed through the languages we use to talk about the arts and humanities and the status of various institutions, and in the light of the methodologies and histories unveiled in each talk. The aim here is to provoke more meaningful public debate about what the study of the past is for, how we should go about it, and what it can give us as a society.

Through my collaboration with UK Rare Books Collections, I will be able to engage those members of the public with interests in rare books and/or the history of French culture. Here I shall work with librarians to offer insights on French holdings in UK collections at the John Rylands Library, Manchester, the Bodleian, Oxford, and the British Library, London. Potential beneficiaries will be both Anglophone and Francophone as I will prepare bilingual webpages surveying the collections and highlighting what particular items can tell us about the ambitions of authors and publishers and the nature of readerships in France and England during the Renaissance. I will offer a talk - 'Books without Borders: French Renaissance Authors in British Libraries' - on these holdings, as part of the libraries' events calendars, promoting them through the Francophone networks of the Institut fran&amp;ccedil;ais and the Alliance Fran&amp;ccedil;aise in each city. But I will also engage with terested parties - the public and researchers, curators, and librarians - in France by presenting the same talk, this time adapted to a French audience, at three institutions in France: a regional library (the Nouvelle Biblioth&amp;egrave;que humaniste at S&amp;eacute;lestat), a print museum in Lyon, and a research institute in Tours. Readers of the webpages and attendees of the 'Books without Borders' talks will benefit in two related ways: firstly, by gaining greater understanding of the cross-border nature of print culture during the Renaissance and of the interactions between France and England in the long sixteenth century and, subsequently, in the establishment of library collections; and secondly, by gaining knowhow on strategies for conducting research in and between France and England. The webpages and talks in the UK and France will be advertised on the bilingual Twitter feed that I shall establish and maintain (@panepistemon), the first to focus on 'All things French Renaissance'.

The third area of impact will be collaboration with producers of television history documentaries. In addition to developing documentary ideas from my research project, I will build on my strong, existing media contacts to explore ways in which academics can change for the better - make less simplistic and more engagingly analytical - the ways in which history is treated on television.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119803</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I am in the early stages still of this project.
