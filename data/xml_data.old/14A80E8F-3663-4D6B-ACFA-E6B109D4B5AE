The aim of the present project is to apply this account to commonsense psychological explanations.\n\nOne of the most important human abilities, underpinning social interaction, is the understanding of why people act as they do. Psychology treats this as a distinct domain of cognition, known as 'Theory of Mind', while philosophers often refer to it as 'folk psychology'. Developmental psychology has established a profile of normal development in this domain over the first five years of life. But we have nothing comparable in the way of systematic understanding of adult folk psychology. Two things which can safely be said about it are that explanations of actions are commonly offered, and that there would appear to be quite a lot of variation in the explanations favoured, both within and between cutures.\n\nThe contrastive model of causal explanation appears able to account for the explanatory relevance of selecting particular parts of a causal history. According to this view the target of an explanation, at least for those explanations which answer Why?-questions, is not an event in its concrete totality, but the contrast between what happened and some other possibility (the foil). This model has the advantage of allowing causal investigation to start at a modest level of knowledge. The explainer can specify the factor which accounts for the contrast by making the difference between the outcome to be explained and the foil, wihtout knowing any exact laws, and even while remaining largely ignorant of many other actual causal factors.\n\nIt seems probable that the contrastive model has a number of applications. The one with which the present project is concerned is the thesis that the folk psychological explanation of actions is predominantly contrastive. This thesis will be defended in a series of linked papers. If an explanation is contrastive, then what exactly the contrast is plays an important role in determining relevance and limiting the information required. In particular, factors also present in the causal history of a contrastive foil are explanatorily redundant. So one paper will focus on action-descriptions, and how norms and social expectations structure the alternative possibilities considered as contrastive foils.\n\nA further paper will consider the ways in which folk psychological explanations are taken as confirmed or shown to be false, and whether such evidential support or disconfirmation fits what might be expected of contrastive explanations. There is also a background issue here of how reliable such folk psychological procedures really are. It is generally considered that they must at least be dependable enough to support our capacity for social interaction. Another paper will then consider variations in folk psychological explanation, both within a culture and between cultures, and to what extent it is possible to account for such variation in terms of variation in contrastive focus. Given the evidence for an innate and universal human mindreading capacity, variations in adult folk psychology stand in need of explanation. The sort of variation in contrasts introduced by contrastive explanation may help to account for much of this variation as being due to fundamentally similar cognitive capacities encountering variation in norms and social environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26058</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Institute of Philosophy Research Seminar Series, hosted by Nottingham University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF36295C-FBB0-4880-B97A-DA5F40C87C92</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation and paper on problems concerning causation which can be tackled by using a model of contrastive causal explanation. Peter Lipton's model of contrastive explanation is used as a starting point. But it is argued that this needs to be modified in a number of ways, There was a long and active discussion session afterwards.

Presentation followed by active audience discussion, in the style of a workshop. The ideas in this seminar were further developed in the paper 'Contrastive Explanation and the Many Absences Problem', and in two further papers: one of which is under review</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-354477446.85642180bb5d102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8C9268C6-7566-4127-8C46-B4ACE2670688</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contrastive Explanation and the Many Absences Problem</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5e7e612caf329dd80ea0688a71ae06fe"><gtr:id>5e7e612caf329dd80ea0688a71ae06fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> George Botterill (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_285574328313a4a53e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0530DC9B-65EA-41F6-AFC0-255010705682</gtr:id><gtr:title>Right and Wrong Reasons in FolkPsychological Explanation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Philosophical Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7e887585516b7e3d03dde3c447c31540"><gtr:id>7e887585516b7e3d03dde3c447c31540</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Botterill G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d03d03d50c5383</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F6E8DD5A-08EA-4B81-BA08-3DC44EB0E622</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contrastive explanation and the many absences problem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Synthese</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3d52e5cdd3dc429c178f8f452c2dd51"><gtr:id>a3d52e5cdd3dc429c178f8f452c2dd51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lavelle J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdefdeafca241</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B494493-F56C-4C50-BEEB-0C4149343F74</gtr:id><gtr:title>Two Kinds of Causal Explanation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoria</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fa07158f4d9b37fb77e63bbc8b842aa2"><gtr:id>fa07158f4d9b37fb77e63bbc8b842aa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BOTTERILL G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06b06b8b0279d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F00382X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
