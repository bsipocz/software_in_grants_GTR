Literature</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K00526X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The representation of Jews in Irish literature is a notably under-researched topic, apart from the character of Leopold Bloom in Joyce's &amp;quot;Ulysses&amp;quot;. The significant presence of Jews in Irish literature since the earliest times deserves to be investigated because initial research undertaken shows the presence of Jews in Irish literature, whether as writers or as characters in writing by Jews and non-Jews, to be more widespread and potentially far more significant than has been realised to date.
This research will demonstrate how the representation of the Jew in Irish literature actually tells us much more about Irish than Jewish identity, how in fact a whole psychohistory, perhaps even psychopathology, of Irishness is hidden in these neglected representations. The project aims to investigate the topic in all eras of Irish literature, in both Irish and English, and to situate the findings within the discourse of Jews in other literatures, including English, American, German and East European. The outcome of the research will be an in-depth study of the topic, an anthology, a web database, and an exhibition in Belfast and Dublin, leading to an academic conference with published proceedings, all of which will establish permanently the significance and meaning of &amp;quot;the Jew&amp;quot; in Irish literature.
This examination of Irish attitudes to Jews as found in Irish literature is of potential interest to all bodies that are engaged with attitudes to racial, national and religious difference, in both Northern Ireland, the Republic and beyond. This includes political parties, immigrant and non-national bodies, and statutory bodies engaged with promoting equality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The prospective beneficiaries of the project identified so far are academics in different academic disciplines. However, the publicly accessible web database and the exhibitions in Belfast and Dublin, together with public lectures at both venues, will bring the wider public to an understanding of the representation of Jews in Irish literature and how this reflects on Irish society. Furthermore, given our clear expectation that our findings will add a significant new dimension to the study of Irish literature, we expect school and university curricula to benefit from the project's outcomes, which will raise the significance of some previously neglected texts.
This benefit will derive from the awareness the project will generate of a whole new dimension to diversity in Irish literature through the ages. Overall, the aim of the project is to inform a discussion about Irish identity that goes beyond the traditional Catholic/Protestant or Irish/British binary divide to look at wider issues around othering, xenophobia, loathing and self-loathing in a way that will force users to reflect on their own identity. We will engage through face-to-face meetings and dissemination of the outputs with bodies that are engaged with Irish attitudes to racial, national and religious difference, in both Northern Ireland and the Republic. This includes political parties, immigrant and non-national bodies, and statutory bodies engaged with promoting equality such as the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council. The Irish-Jewish Museum in Dublin is one such body that has already expressed its support for this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>408375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Armagh Public Lbrary</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exhibition - Armagh Public Library</gtr:description><gtr:id>ED102882-0FEB-4C40-97E0-E40177A6608B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These will follow in and after August 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda3da4149f0.58767618-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Liaising with project team to design exhibition space and content.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaborating with Library staff to design the exhibition content and format.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exhibition - NUI Galway</gtr:description><gtr:id>24967B0E-2C4C-4303-B94A-6BE404821E2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes will follow in 2016-17.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7bb0be6a68.88093815-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The NUI Galway Library will provide the space to host the exhibition and also facilities for three research talks.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As PI I have met and got approval from the NUI Galway Library Committee to host in December-January 2016-17 the project exhibition which will be launched at the Royal Irish Academy on 30 June 2016.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Irish Academy (RIA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>RIA Library</gtr:department><gtr:description>Exhibition - RIA</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C53FC8E-9180-40AA-97BE-0F71A84E341C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The full outcome will be the exhibition, due to open on 30 June 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7a7c5bc197.71623906-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Librarian at the RIA has identified the appropriate spacing, set-up procedures, and also sourced valuable items for the display.

We are building blocks for the website, which is only lightly populated now. Overall, it is too early for our work to have been taken up, however two papers have been given by the postdoctoral researcher, Dr Barry Montgomery, and these have begun the process of take-up by academics and agencies beyond UU. 

We have raised awareness with the Jewish Museum in Dublin, which will host our exhibition in year 3, and these links will result in some co-working. The Museum is the principal centre on the island for Jewish life and culture, and has strong cross-border ties. The investigators maintain regular contact with the management team there, and have asked them to determine anything which we can do with our work to help them. One of the principle agreements in that respect is to seek ways of representing Jewish culture rather than merely anti-Semitism. We believe this connection to the museum is potentially very rich and in all likelihood durable. 

But we are at an early stage now.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0BE9F793-F8F4-4B15-AB94-CA39802FFDE5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54609aea1c1e17.31365268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The postdoctoral research, Montgomery, and investigators, &amp;Oacute; Dochartaigh and Andrews, have begun to discover that the range and complexity of references to Jews in Irish literature was far more greater than even was anticipated by us. We have also begun to conceptualise the position of Jews in literature within wider cultural and social settings, for example within newspapers and government writings, travellers' accounts, and other sources beyond poetry and prose. Even now, the potential for developing the project beyond its initial scope is significant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We feel the work will be used by academic to develop Irish-Jewish studies, and to integrate hitherto limited Irish angles into wider Jewish Studies. Also our relationship with the Jewish Museum is developing to such an extent that it possible to envisage a collaborative doctoral programme, and co-application to other funders to develop engagement and educational dimensions. 

Just to stress, however, we are at year 1 end, and we are still very much in the research stage.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E4A2B260-D894-4FE8-994D-19A0678F2698</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54609ddb2848a2.27790076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.arts.ulster.ac.uk/jewishrepresentations/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K00526X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E724DBDB-3FC6-4FE8-BE85-5ECBDE8A799E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Celtic Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
