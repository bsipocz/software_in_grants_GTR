In the same period more than 1,800 people lost their lives, drowning as overloaded and often unseaworthy boats sank into the sea. Although the crisis is in many ways nothing new, these scenes have captured the public and media imagination and have challenged the ability of European States to respond appropriately. Recent months have seen increasingly heated discussions at the national and EU level about whether rescues at sea are a vital humanitarian intervention or simply encourage others to attempt the crossing, and whether those who arrive can be dealt with through mandatory or voluntary relocation quotas. Many of these discussions are underpinned by assumptions about why it is that migrants make the journey to Europe in the first place.

In this context the research aims to better understand the dynamics of migration in the Mediterranean region by providing the first large-scale, systematic and comparative study of the backgrounds, experiences, aspirations and routes of migrants in four European countries (Italy, Greece, Malta and Turkey) gathered from 550 migrants who have recently arrived and 100 stakeholders. The research pushes the theoretical and conceptual boundaries of migration studies, encouraging critical reflexive dialogue and practice by opening new and inclusive spaces for questioning and challenging established ways of categorising and thinking about with the Mediterranean migration crisis. In so doing it will create opportunities for increased policy dialogue and academic collaboration between the case study countries - and across the EU more generally - around the evidence gathered.

The research is underpinned by a number of urgent research questions which inform the collection and analysis of the data:
1. What are the underlying factors shaping migration from countries of origin and how do the characteristics and backgrounds of migrants shape the response to structural issues?
2. What are the opportunity structures that shape, inform or constrain migrant journeys to Europe? 
3. What are the differences between the Central Mediterranean (principally from Libya to Italy and Malta) and Eastern (Turkey to Greece) Mediterranean routes? 
4. To what extent are migrant journeys to Europe, or particular countries within Europe, shaped or even determined by non-state actors (agents, facilitators and civil society)? 
5. What are the impacts of policies intended to deter or prevent migrants from crossing the Mediterranean?

The research will be delivered by a team of leading UK migration scholars from the Universities of Coventry, Oxford, Birmingham and Sussex working in collaboration with academic partners in the case study countries and supported by experts from international, governmental and non-governmental organisations. The team has established relationships with local civil society organisations that will facilitate access to research participants and provide advice and information on policy or other developments which could impact on the delivery of the project.

The research will benefit a wide range of academic, governmental, international and civil society organisations and inform the development of strategic, political and policy responses to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. This impact will be secured through a three-stage stage process involving: the production of evidence in formats accessible to a range of audiences; a clearly articulated process for securing impact involving dissemination events and outreach activities to connect the evidence with audiences that influence and inform the policy making process and; the development of cross-national networks of researchers, policy makers and practitioners to drive longer term policy change. These will create feedback loops and opportunities for further research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research seeks to push the theoretical and conceptual boundaries of migration studies, gather and analyse data on migrants who have made the journey across the Mediterranean into Europe with the view to better understand the dynamics of this particular migration process and to inform the development of appropriate strategic, political and policy responses to the current migration crisis.

The primary beneficiaries of this research will be:

1. Academic community working across range of disciplines will benefit from the improved evidence on migration across the Mediterranean (four distinct geographical contexts) and increased availability of systematic and comparative data available for further research. The evidence resulting from our multidisciplinary approach will reduce the significant limitations of the more frequent academic research on 'the migrant experience' driven by, and tied to, abstract and distinct migrant categories created by law and policy to contain - and make sense of - migration flows. Future research will be able to draw on the new insights into the ways in which nationality, economic status (class), gender, race and age shape the journeys and experiences of migrants, and situating the multidimensional individual within broader historical, social, economic, and political contexts at local, national and international levels. 

2. National migration policy makers in Greece, Italy, Malta, Turkey and the UK will benefit from access to our systematic and comparative dataset and analysis on migration in the region which will provide insights into migrant motivations, aspirations and journeys and better understanding of the dynamics behind the migration process.

3. Civil society organisations working with migrants in each case study country which campaign for the rights of migrants and grassroots organisations and provide immediate assistance to arriving migrants will be able to use our data and findings to better understand the needs of their target populations and more effectively advocate on behalf of those implicated in the migration crisis. 

4. International policy makers and practitioners from the European Commission (DG Migration and Home Affairs Irregular Migration and Return, European Asylum Support Office, Frontex, Europol) and international organisations (IOM, UNHCR, OHCHR, ICMPD, UNODC) will benefit from the data for the refinement and continued negotiation of the EU Agenda on Migration and emergency measures in response to the migration crisis. Improved communication of evidence to national and international policy makers will create better understanding of causes and implications of the migration in the Mediterranean and generate improved strategic, political and policy response. 

5. International and national public audiences will benefit from media stories and narratives about the motivations, aspirations and challenges of migrants who undertake the journey to Europe. Better informed public narratives will, in turn, create increased political space for an appropriate policy response to the crisis. 

6. The project team, advisory and stakeholder groups will gain longer term impact facilitated by increased opportunities for networking among national and international partners, improved cross-national dialogue on migration across the Mediterranean and the membership of the cross-national network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168225</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Migration/Diplomacy seminar, MfA Turkey, 5/2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09EE5C2E-1827-4BF9-822B-0D859D77A6D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by the Strategic Studies centre of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Turkey and talked to a mixed audience of policy makers, embassy staff and other practitioners.

Speakers' input provided stimulus for a conversation about what Europe's 'migration crisis' means for the local area and how best the local Labour Party and individuals might respond.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dbfc18c88aa7.43827997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Essay, ESRC News website, 24/9/2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AA1157B-F20B-4934-BFC4-342A3D8753E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alerting readers of ESRC News to the complexities of the refugee and European crisis</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd89dda5b425.89132006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/news/news-items/from-a-refugee-crisis-to-a-crisis-of-europe/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Special issue of Escapism Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF298B11-C0BD-45B1-8E43-9CFE9B70931E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed to a special issue of Escapism Magazine including article on 'Understanding the refugee crisis', published 3rd December and given out free at all London Underground stations in Zones 1 and 2, also significant online presence</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dbf283d6cf22.84030249</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.escapismmagazine.com/the-situation/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sanctuary in Parliament 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0CCFEACB-122F-4279-B939-AEDBEE6DD8DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the 1st December 2015, City of Sanctuary and Sanctuary Alliance partners converged on Westminster for the second time to hold the annual Sanctuary in Parliament event.

Over subsequent months we drilled down into the data to better understand the journeys and aspirations of those on the move and the impact of EU and national policies both on their decisions and choices and on patterns of movement into and cross Europe during the course of 2015. In September 2016 we published two further Research Briefs of the dynamics of migration through the Central and Eastern Mediterranean routes. Our final report was launch in Brussels on 3rd November 2016.

Our final report unpacks the journeys and routes to Europe of the people who took part in this research and provides a framework for understanding the diverse array of strategies that individuals pursue in an attempt to secure safety and a livelihood for themselves and their families. It examines the factors that shaped the decision of our respondents to leave their home countries and, in the case of those who spent extended periods of time in a number of other countries, continue their journeys onwards towards Europe. And it explores the relationship between respondents and the smugglers who facilitated their journeys.

The key findings of the research are as follows:

- The representation of the movement of refugees and migrants as linear, singular uninterrupted journeys or flows of people heading toward Europe is grossly misleading. The focus on the points of departure and the sea crossings is equally misleading. These simplifications distract from what were often multiple separate movements which converged in Libya and Turkey helping to explain the arrival of refugees and migrants in Italy and Greece respectively.
- The average duration of migration for those arriving in Greece via the Eastern Mediterranean route was considerably shorter than for those arriving via the Central Mediterranean route to Italy or Malta. The time between leaving the country of origin and arriving in Europe was shortest for Syrians and Iraqis and longest for Afghans and Eritreans.
- Our findings challenge the idea that all those arriving in Europe have crossed all the borders on their journey irregularly (without authorisation and/or the necessary documentation). There are significant differences between groups depending on their access to documents and other resources which results in a mixture of regular and irregular crossings. 
- Many respondents witnessed death and/or experienced violence during their migration. Experiences of violence and death were not limited to the sea crossing but could be found along the entire route. More than three quarters (76%) of respondents who were interviewed in Italy and Malta said that they had directly experienced physical violence and nearly a third (29%) had witnessed fellow travellers dying. The majority of these episodes occurred in Algeria, Niger and Libya.
- Conflict in the countries neighbouring Europe was a major factor contributing to the significant increase in the number of refugees and migrants arriving in 2015, both as a cause of primary and secondary movement. 
- More than three quarters (77%) of respondents explicitly mentioned factors that could be described as 'forced migration'. The figure was even higher at 91% for those interviewed in Greece reflecting the significant proportion of Syrians in our sample. 
- Although the situation is more complicated for the Central Mediterranean route, nearly two thirds (66%) of those who were interviewed in Italy and Malta made reference to factors associated with 'forced migration' when describing the reasons they decided to leave their home country. Many more had experienced conflict, persecution and human rights abuses in the countries to which they subsequently moved, most notably Libya.
- More than a quarter (28%) of respondents interviewed in Greece told us that the activities of Islamic State (IS) had been an important factor in the decision to leave, particularly in Syria but also in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. 
- Respondents from Syria and Iraq described kidnapping by State and non-State agencies (including a range of militia groups) as a significant factor in their decision to leave their countries of origin. Those who had spent time in Libya also described the risk of kidnapping as a significant factor in the decision to move on. 
- For Eritreans, Syrians and Afghans living in Iran, the risk / fear of forced indefinite conscription into the government army, militia or rebel force was a major factor underlying the decision to leave. 
- There is often a complex and overlapping relationship between 'forced' and 'economic' drivers of migration to Europe. Many of those who left their home countries primarily due to economic reasons effectively became refugees and were forced to move due to the situation in Libya and elsewhere. 
- Others who decided to leave their homes due to conflict subsequently decided to move on again because they were unable to make a living or access healthcare and education. 
- A third of respondents interviewed in Greece had moved on for what might typically be understood as economic reasons. 
- There were significant differences between those interviewed in Greece and Italy as to whether they intended to stay in the first European country in which they had arrived. Virtually none of those who were interviewed in Greece intended to stay compared to more than two thirds (68%) of those interviewed in Italy. 
- All of our respondents engaged the services of a smuggler for at least one leg of their journey to Greece or Italy. This was primarily because they were unable to access a safe and legal route to safety and/or protection. 
- One in ten of our interviewees who entered Europe via the Eastern Mediterranean route had tried but failed to identify an alternative way to migrate legally, for example by applying for a visa for work or study, a UN resettlement programme or family reunification.
- Smugglers performed two main functions for our respondents: they helped them to escape danger, conflict or persecution at home or en route and they enabled them to bypass controlled borders where these were a barrier to reaching safety, protection and/or livelihoods.
- Contrary to the dominant representation of smugglers by politicians and the media as being part of vast criminal networks, our research found that smugglers were embedded in migrant social networks and local communities en route and were easy to find. By far the majority of interviewees across both the Central and the Eastern routes found their smugglers through friends, family members and extended social networks, either at home or along the way. 
- According to our respondents, State officials, the military, law enforcement and border guards were also involved in smuggling. 
- Many of our respondents experienced violence and threats from smugglers (along both routes), but it is important to acknowledge that violence also came from other actors (e.g. State officials, militias, military and the police). 
- We also found some examples of human trafficking along the Central Mediterranean route, in particular concerning women from Nigeria and many examples of forced labour intermingled with smugglers. Respondents were often not clear however of the boundaries between the various actors and their different roles. 

The findings of our research have significant implications for EU migration policy making. The key ones are highlighted below:

- The humanitarian crisis that unfolded on the borders of the European Union - and is now increasingly unfolding inside - was not the result of a natural or unforeseen disaster. The arrival of large numbers of refugees and migrants was neither new nor unexpected. Rather the 'crisis' was, in large part, policy driven and sustained by the failure of the EU to put in place adequate and humane responses to deal with this unprecedented but also foreseeable movement of people.
- The failure of EU policies to respond effectively to the increased movement of people across the Mediterranean in 2015 was partly a reflection of political differences and tensions within and between EU Member States but also reflected flawed assumptions about the reasons why people move, the factors that shape their longer-term migration trajectories and their journeys to Europe. These assumptions became deeply politicised over the course of 2015.
- Due to the enormous diversity of geographies, people, drivers and motives a broad brush approach to migration across the Mediterranean will be insufficient. There is a need for nuanced, tailored and targeted policy responses which reflect the diverse, stratified and increasingly protracted and fragmented movements of people. 
- Policy makers need to address both the primary and secondary drivers of migration to Europe. Although there is growing awareness within the EU of the need to pay attention to the drivers of forced migration, including the need for co-ordination in the fields of foreign policy, development and trade, the focus at the EU level has instead been on tackling irregular migration through improved co-ordination of border controls in order to contain the movement of people within countries and regions of origin. The focus needs to shift towards improving access to rights and socio-economic security in the countries hosting significantly larger number of refugees and migrants than Europe.
- There is a complex relationship between forced and economic drivers of migration to Europe. EU governments are legally obligated to treat all of those who arrive in accordance with international law, including with regard to the right to seek asylum. In practice this means providing access to protection for refugees and migrants arriving in Europe through irregular channels. It also means recognising that people's reasons for leaving their counties of origin and travelling to Europe are complex and cannot be determined by nationality alone. 
- EU politicians and policy makers have repeatedly declared they are 'at war' with the smugglers and that they intend to 'break the smugglers business model'. The evidence from our research suggests that smuggling is driven, rather than broken, by EU policy. 
- The closure of borders seems likely to have significantly increased the demand for, and use of, smugglers who have become the only option for those unable to leave their countries or enter countries in which protection might potentially be available to them. 
- At the same time the number of people drowning in their attempt to cross the Mediterranean has increased significantly. Since the beginning of 2016 the number of people dying has increased to 1 in 46 people among those crossing via the Central Mediterranean route and to 1 death in every 407 arrivals via the Eastern Mediterranean route. In other words the death rate for the short distance from Turkey to Greece has more than doubled.
- There is an urgent need to significantly expand safe and legal routes for protection. This includes significantly expanding current resettlement programmes, increasing humanitarian visas or establishing temporary international protection for those with a prima facie case for refugee status and increasing the scale of family reunification.
- The EU has focused almost exclusively on policies designed to contain refugees and migrants in countries and regions of origin at the expense of addressing the reception and protection needs of those arriving from situations of conflict, persecution and human rights abuse. There has also been a failure at the national and EU levels to address the longer-term integration needs of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe. 
- During the course of 2015 the EU has intensified pressure on other countries to stem the flow and assume responsibility for refugee and migrants from neighbouring countries so they do not travel onward to Europe. There is a risk that efforts to stem the flow of migration to the EU exacerbate the conflict, violence and human rights abuse that leads people to leave in the first place. 
- Policy makers need to engage with the issue of development as an important policy objective in its own right rather than primarily as a mechanism for preventing migration to Europe. And they need to be aware that the politics of containment - reflected in interdiction, interception and off-shore processing - have 'ripple effects' with developed countries taking a lead from the example of Europe and, in turn, reducing the protection they provide. As a result the European response to the so-called 'migration crisis' not only undermines access to protection for those arriving at Europe's shores but threatens the principle of international protection at a global level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have devised an extensive programme of events and activities to disseminate the findings of the research. In March we held our first policy forum in Oxford to explore the implications of the research with policy makers, international and national organisations and academics based mainly in the UK. We subsequently secured additional funding for dissemination events in Rome, Athens and New York. Our final report was launched at a high-level policy event in Brussels and in the period since then we have continued to engage with politicians, policy makers, practitioners and advocates through the media and through the wide range of national and international events to which we are increasingly invited. The objective of these engagement activities is to ensure that the findings of the research inform both the development of appropriate policy responses including safe and legal access to international protection, and the evolution of political and policy narratives on migration to Europe at the national and regional levels which better reflects the complex dynamics and drivers of migration to the region.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F35BDF59-1D99-4259-9786-CEE07524CFEB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dbd3a5e3f077.50811916</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.medmig.info</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Independent Commission for Aid Impact, consultation, 11/2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>10CB1BA3-D3DB-4F71-AE87-B53CF10953A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I provided evidence to the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) scrutinising UK Aid specifically UK's Aid response to the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.

Interviews were transcribed in English to ensure consistency across the dataset. It was then cleaned and coded at different levels and analysed using spreadsheets, NVivo software and GIS Mapping software. This particular dataset includes quantitative data on who was on the move, the journeys that they made and the routes that they took. Specifically it shows two levels of data:

1. Micro-level (individual): who was interviewed and their key demographic and socio-economic characteristics 
2. Journey and route level: who moved through which locations, across which routes and the timeframe that this took place in.

Together, the data across these two levels enables an examination of the relationship between micro-level characteristics and the geographies of migration that were recorded during our interviews.

The team member responsible for the database is in the process of uploading the database and metadata to the UK Data Service and the ReShare portal. He registered on those website on 20th February but is still awaiting confirmation to be able to upload the files themselves. Once the upload is complete the url will be inserted here.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E025EDE-9F6E-4D63-91CE-34AD9DD7B30D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data from this file has supported many of our key project findings, which have subsequently been widely reported in the press and during public speaking.

In particular, the dataset of the journeys and stops making up migration routes, employed to map out the geography of the migration crisis as we heard it from interviewees was used to produce a series of maps. The maps illustrated the routes taken by people from their country of origin to the place at which we interviewed them. These maps and the articles describing them were reported in numerous media outlets, such as The Independent (No direct flight: new maps show the fragmented journeys of migrants and refugees to Europe, http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/no-direct-flight-new-maps-show-the-fragmented-journeys-of-migrants-and-refugees-to-europe-a7393736.html) and by international organisations such as the World Economic Forum (These two maps will change how you think about the journeys of migrants and refugees, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/these-two-maps-will-change-how-you-think-about-the-journeys-of-migrants-and-refugees-36f4a603-f461-4521-80e3-9b50dbb5acd3).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b08b1cea7889.32661904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>MEDMIG Final dataset</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCD376E0-E5BA-4D66-903F-76356B52FE1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The expert: I have a duty to share my work on migration.
