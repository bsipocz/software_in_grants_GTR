For example, skin cells are flat and protect our body, whereas neurons can be very long and transmit signals from distant parts of the body to our brain. Nevertheless, all cells contain the same genetic information, which is organized into genes. What makes the cells unique and different from one to another is which genes are turned on or off. When this switch does not work properly, it can lead to developmental defects or diseases such as cancer.

The genetic information is stored in the form of DNA. The DNA is then copied to a molecule called RNA, which is the template for the synthesis of proteins in a process called translation. The proteins make our cells how they look like and what they do. 

RNAs are not naked in a cell but rather covered by several proteins, so-called RNA-binding proteins. These RNA-binding proteins can remove or rearrange parts of the RNA, store or deliver them to particular locations, and ultimately destroy the RNA. They also control how efficiently RNAs are translated into proteins. RNA-binding proteins therefore act as a control tower directing the fate of RNA, being stored, translated or destroyed. As a consequence, if a RNA-binding protein does not work properly, it can lead to diseases.

Besides the RNA-binding proteins, research in the last years revealed that there are certain classes of RNAs - so called non-coding RNAs - that can bind to and regulate other RNAs. RNAs are therefore combinatorially controlled by both RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs. 

Therefore, it is of immense interest to know, which proteins and non-coding RNAs interact with RNA and how this may be changed in case of a disease. Nevertheless, accessing this information is challenging as researchers lack simple and robust tools to investigate it.

Our objective is to develop these tools and comprehensively identify the proteins and non-coding RNAs that are bound to RNAs. We first aim to get a general view of all the proteins that interact with RNA in a cell. We will then engineer a handle on a particular RNA to pull it out and look for the proteins and other RNAs that sit on it. We will then have a close look how the composition of these 'trans-acting factors' changes upon conditions that simulate the environment in cancer cells.

One way to establish a new tool for research is to test it in a model which is simpler to handle than human cells. We will therefore first establish the tool in the bakers yeast, which is a single-celled organisms called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then go one step ahead and establish it human cells in order to identify the RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs that regulate RNAs with pivotal functions in cancer. 

At the end, we expect a better understanding how combinations of RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs affect the fate of RNAs. We hope that this insight will give us important clues about how the production of proteins can go wrong to play a critical role in cancer cells. Ultimately, this may lead to new targets for drug development and the treatment of human disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The fate of mRNAs in the cytosol is determined by RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. Despite the major roles of these trans-acting factors for RNA metabolism, we still lack sophisticated tools to comprehensively identify the RNA-binding proteins and RNAs that combinatorially control the fate of mRNAs.

We therefore aim to develop these tools to comprehensively identify the proteins and RNAs that interact with mRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human cells. Thereby, we will implement global and specific approaches. On the global level, we will define the set of proteins that are bound to native polyadenylated mRNAs and therefore, we will combine RNA-protein crosslinking with an established method for the purification of mRNAs via oligo-dT coupled magnetic beads, which is then followed by in-depth mass spectrometry analysis of bound RNA-binding proteins. We will then identify the trans-acting factors from normal and stress-treated cells, which will provide a comprehensive view of the composition and dynamics of mRNA binding proteins - the mRNA-protein interactome. 

For the targeted approach, we will establish a new tandem RNA affinity purification strategy that combines RNA aptamer based purification with an antisense oligonucleotide approach to identify the set of proteins or RNAs that specifically bind to selected messages - or the 3' UTR thereof - with mass spec and sequencing, respectively. We will establish and optimize the method on well-characterized bud-tip localized mRNAs in yeast, and investigate the complement of proteins and microRNAs that are implicated in combinatorial control of cancer-related messages in human cells.

The project should provide a valuable platform to study post-transcriptional control of mRNAs. We expect to discover new RNA-binding proteins and principles of combinatorial control. At the end, it could even provide new targets for the development of drugs for cancer treatment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

This project is primarily a basic research project, which nevertheless is likely to lead to new insights of interest to several groups of users and beneficiaries outside of the academic research community (already identified in the previous section). In the medium term a wider group of beneficiaries are expected:

1) Pharmaceutical/Biotechnological companies involved in drug discovery. Several small molecules that target the post-transcriptional control of aberrantly expressed messages are currently developed and/or in clinical trials (e.g. PTC Therapeutics). Our RNA affinity purification method could identify the targets of these drugs. Therefore, the method may become of considerable interest to the biotech industry that develops small-molecules to target gene expression regulatory circuits or that work in the broader field of gene therapy. 

2) The UK trained workforce will benefit from this proposal through the training of a PDRA researcher who will acquire new skills in RNA biology, systems biology, proteomics and two model systems (yeast, human cell culture) from the combined expertise of the applicants.

3) As the applicants teach in a research-led environment, undergraduate and postgraduate students will benefit from hearing about this work.

4) The general public in terms of gaining a better understanding of RNA regulation and its implications in human disease.

How will they benefit?

1) Our results will be of significant interest to clinicians and/or pharmaceutical industries who are seeking to develop new therapies for cancer treatment. VEGF is currently the major target for cancer therapy and therefore, information about its post-transcriptional control could provide new entry points for the development of new drugs for treatment. Moreover, our general ambition to explore the interactive space of RNA-binding proteins will probably lead to the discovery of unexpected proteins that interact with RNA. In this regard, we recently identified several metabolic enzymes that also bind to RNA and thus, they could are likely to have dual functions. Many drugs are derived against enzymes and so, unraveling additional functions for them is important to understand drug action.

2) By developing skills in RNA biology/ proteomics/ systems biology, the PDRA will mature into a highly trained researcher who will be able to pursue a career in academic or industrial research. In addition, the PDRA will be in a position to teach high-level techniques to postgraduate students. This will impact in the area of training and delivering highly skilled people.

3) The knowledge obtained though this research will contribute to fundamental theories and concepts underlying gene expression regulation. We will impart this new knowledge to undergraduate students, via teaching activity and research project supervision. School pupils will also benefit though the numerous engagement activities we undertake to promote RNA biology. 

4) It is anticipated that the current application will be of great interest to the media and the public. This work not only provides an exciting scientific story, but the research also relates to public health and could have long lasting implications for disease treatment, therefore impacting in the area of Public engagement, public health and societal issues. 

Finally, by completing this novel project, we will reinforce the UK's position in the field of RNA research, contributing to attract more talented undergraduate students and postgraduate researchers to UK universities and stimulate research. Thus, this project will also impact in the International development area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>324782</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborator - Jon Hall, ETH Zurich</gtr:description><gtr:id>812C9537-A05A-434C-800A-FAD11DCEAC6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We published some papers together:

Aim 1: We have completed the 1st aim of the proposed research and published the results in a high-impact peer-reviewed journal (Matia-Gonzalez et al. 2015, NSMB). Therein, we combined RNA-protein crosslinking with an established method for the purification of mRNAs via oligo-dT coupled magnetic beads, which was followed by in-depth mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of bound proteins (supported by the MS facility at University of Bristol). We defined a repertoire of 765 and 594 proteins that reproducibly interacted with polyadenylated RNAs in the unicellular eukaryote yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and - supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation - in multicellular nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans). Furthermore, we reported the differential association of mRNA-binding proteins (mRPBs) upon induction of apoptosis in C. elegans L4-stage larvae, suggesting stress- specific remodelling of proteins bound to mRNAs on a global-scale. Intriguingly, we found that most proteins composing mRBPomes, including components of early metabolic pathways and the proteasome, were evolutionarily conserved between yeast and C. elegans. We speculated, on the basis of our evidence that glycolytic enzymes bind distinct glycolytic mRNAs, that enzyme-mRNA interactions relate to an ancient mechanism for post-transcriptional coordination of metabolic pathways that perhaps was established during the transition from the early 'RNA world' to the 'protein world'. The results from this study were used to frame a successful application to another BBSRC grant (BB/N008820/1). 
 As suggested in our original application, we have further analysed changes in the mRNA-binding proteome (mRBPome) upon application of oxidative stress (implemented through hydrogen peroxide) to yeast cells. We found changes in the mRNA associations of subsets of RBPs, some of them known to have stress-related functions. Possibly more interesting, we found substantial rearrangement of particular classes of metabolic enzymes upon exposure to oxidative stress. Currently, we are integrating our data with previously published datasets that analysed changes in mRNAs or protein levels in yeast cells exposed to oxidative stress. A manuscript describing the results is in preparation.

Aim 2: We have established a variety of RNA affinity purification strategies that combine RNA aptamer based purification and/or antisense oligonucleotides to identify the set of proteins that specifically bind to selected messages - or the 3' UTR thereof - with mass-spectrometry. 

One the hand, we established a Tandem RNA Isolation Procedure (TRIP) that enables rapid purification of in vivo formed messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes from cells or entire organisms without the need for genetic modification (Matia-Gonzalez et al. 2016, Methods). TRIP relies on the purification of polyadenylated mRNAs with oligo(dT) beads from cellular extracts, followed by the capture of specific mRNAs with 3'-biotinylated 2'-O-methylated antisense RNA oligonucleotides, which are recovered with streptavidin beads. TRIP was applied to isolate in vivo crosslinked mRNP complexes from yeast, nematodes and human cells for subsequent analysis of RNAs and bound proteins. The method provides a basis for adaptation to other types of polyadenylated RNAs, enabling the comprehensive identification of bound proteins/RNAs, and the investigation of dynamic rearrangement of mRNPs imposed by cellular or environmental cues. We have recently published the TRIP method (Matia-Gonzalez et al. 2016, Methods) to make it accessible to the wider research community; and we were approached by several groups that wish to implement the protocol in their research.

As proposed in our application, we then decided to primarily focus on the human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) mRNA, which bears several well characterised binding sites for regulatory mRNA-binding proteins in the 3'UTR (e.g. PUM1/2, DND1, HuR). CDKN1B, also termed p27, codes for an important tumour suppressor that is extensively regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and protein level. Furthermore, increased levels of p27 have been reported to correlate with cisplatin resistance (cistplatin is a chemo-therapeutic agent that binds DNA and induces DNA strand crosslinks and is used for certain cancer treatments). Although TRIP enables the capture of endogenously formed RNP complexes on p27 mRNA, we encountered difficulties to obtain sufficient amounts for reliable MS analysis. We have thus generated an inducible cell line (HEK293) expressing GFP fused to the 3'UTR of p27 bearing a newly developed RNA aptamer (a modification of a tobramycin aptamer). Likewise, we engineered cells expressing GFP fused to the 3'UTR of Caspase-3 (Casp-3; coding for an important apoptotic factor) as well as cells that bear no additional 3'UTR as a negative control. We have established a protocol for purification of the respective tagged mRNAs under stringent conditions and performed triplicate MS analysis to identify bound proteins. We also tested for changes of bound proteins upon treatment of cells with cisplatin; and we found significant changes for more than 30 RPBs bound to the 3'UTR of p27, among them HuR, a stress-responsive RBP known to interact with p27 3'UTR. These data suggested dynamic remodelling of RNA-protein association upon cisplatin treatment. We have further investigated the effect/impact for several of these RBPs on p27 expression by performing knock-down of selected RBPs in HEK293 cells with RNA interference (RNAi). We observed significant alterations in p27 mRNA and proteins levels cells for five out of the seven selected candidate proteins; suggesting that these proteins could be involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of p27 expression. We are currently performing further validation to consolidate the data and prepare a manuscript for publication. Overall, the study provides insight into dynamics of RNPs association with a cancer-related mRNAs, and it gives better understanding of cisplatin action in cells. 

In conclusion, we have established robust methods to identify the components of individual mRNP complexes under different conditions/cell-types. We obtained first insight in the full-complement of trans-acting factors that integrate the posttranscriptional control a cancer-related mRNA (p27). In the future, a more in-depth characterisation of the trans-acting factors that regulate cancer-related mRNAs or non-coding RNAs could potentially lead to new targets for drug development and treatment of cancer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Aim 1: The results from aim 1 were implemented in another successful grant application to the BBSRC (BB/N008820/1). Furthermore, the PI has been invited to present this work at conferences, where it attracted a lot of attention beyond the immediate RNA field. Foremost, the discovery of RNA-binding capacity of glycolytic enzymes attracted the interest from the medical field (i.e. Warburg effect, relation to inflammation). Overall, our results provide a robust basis for the study of new RBPs (including metabolic enzymes), which could lead to unexpected findings with substantial impact in the longer term.

Aim 2: We have recently published the TRIP method (Matia-Gonzalez et al. 2016, Methods) to make it immediately accessible to the wider research community. Soon after publication, we were approached by several groups that wish to implement the protocol in their research. TRIP and our novel RNA aptamer-based method (unpublished) is likely to be adopted by diverse researchers to study combinatorial control of mRNAs or non-coding RNAs. On this line, the rapidly increasing number of long-noncoding RNAs with unknown functions (more than 20,000 lncRNAs in human) that are currently discovered creates a rich source for adaptation of our method. Our method might thus provide the foundation for many new discoveries with potential impact in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0FCC54AD-85D5-495C-88CA-4FFFB1FA8706</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54523156bef2f5.12946645</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2015/new-research-suggests-novel-route-fight-against-cancer</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium database under accession codes PXD002293 and PXD002226, corresponding to the S. cerevisiae and C. elegans mRBPomes, respectively.
