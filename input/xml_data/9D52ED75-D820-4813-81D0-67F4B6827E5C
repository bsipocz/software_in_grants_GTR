Upon successful implementation and testing in the proposed participatory studies, the outcome of the research will inform Malaysia on means for effectively infusing the CreativeCulture model to assist and accelerate learning for children in remote rural locations.

To develop the CreativeCulture model, the project will explore, exploit and experiment the impact of arts, design and culture in enhancing creative thinking, problem solving and development in education through game design and computational thinking. The project is aligned with the inclusion of Arts in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education (STEAM), realising the potential of these subjects by enabling true innovation and new thinking through creativity. Art and culture boost creativity and creativity leads to innovation, new thinking and moving beyond
existing skills; all together are triggers and needed in the social and economical transformation. There is also a need for fun, playful, hands-on, socially and culturally grounded explorations of topics during primary and secondary school to foster contextualised and deeper learning. Hence, creating games as a cooperative activity on the edge of the diverse fields of Art, Design, Culture, Science, and Engineering can be a fertile ground to cultivate these mind-sets and practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>(i) Transformation in educational practices: The needs of Malaysia to continue sustaining growth in its economy towards reaching developed status hinges on a progressing and updated system of education. CreativeCulture will impact two of the eleven shifts of the system transformation in the Malaysian Educational Blueprint (MEB) 2013-2025:
-SHIFT 7: LEVERAGE ICT TO SCALE UP QUALITY LEARNING ACROSS MALAYSIA - CreativeCulture will design and develop adaptable programmes for enhancing creative problem-solving skills of primary and secondary school students, especially for rural and indigenous ethnic students informed by best practices in game design and computational thinking.
-SHIFT 9: PARTNER WITH PARENTS, COMMUNITY, AND PRIVATE SECTOR AT SCALE - CreativeCulture will extend the concept of creative learning from adoption in schools to wide-scale awareness of parents, communities and government agencies as learning is shifted from inside the classroom to everyday life. Acknowledgement of informal learning as an extension to formal methods is an important means for reshaping learning and learner preparedness to better match the needs of the 21st century knowledge economies and open societies.

(ii) Transcultural, creative, open and inclusive education: Rural communities around the world are marginalised due to lack of access, translating into huge knowledge divide. Given that Malaysia has diverse cultural communities with disparate ethnic groups in rural areas, cultural-ethnic considerations remain central in the Malaysian implementation of education policy. Despite the government's efforts to bridge the achievement gaps (equality), improving access to education and raising standards (quality) and promoting unity among students in the education policy development, many arguments suggested that the objective of the United Nation has not yet been achieved. Despite the implementation of special awareness programs and improving the infrastructure facilities in schools in rural areas, the challenges still exists due to the local culture, state of poverty (although the poverty rate has considerably reduced over the years) and attitude (dropouts, low percentage of rural and indigenous students completing their secondary schools). There is a need for culturalpedagogy to be developed and implemented to create fun and engaging learning that is sympathetic to their localised needs (including cultural heritage), to cultivate creativity and inclusivity in learning. CreativeCulture will address these issues by designing the CreativeCulture model/blueprint for use by the different learning communities to ensure equal access to creative teaching and learning methods, exploiting richness and diversity in culture for promoting creat ive, transcultural, open and inclusive means of facilitating education. The impact from this project will have significant implications for not only the pilot groups but also for many more in similar or worse situations the world over.

(iii) Creative economy: The MEB aims to transform the education system to address the need for a competitive and skilled labour force that is fresh, innovative and of high quality with a need to improve students' skills in critical thinking, creativity, communications and leadership qualities. CreativeCulture aims to provide the means for fostering creative and innovative culture in teaching and learning hinging on the potential impact of creative skills in uplifting the economy, aligning with the Malaysian government's emphasis on Creative Industries(CI) being one of the Entry Point Projects (EPPs) under the National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs) due to its potential in enhancing the Gross National Income. The government expects CI to contribute RM3 billion to the country's GNI and the creation of 10,000 jobs by 2020. As such, the government is in full support to initiatives that will boost the local creative industries in multiple aspects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P013937/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
