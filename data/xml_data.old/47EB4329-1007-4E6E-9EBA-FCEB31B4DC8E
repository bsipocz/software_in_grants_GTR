&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>How do people live complex cultural difference, managing increasing cultural diversity in their everyday lives? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What role does place and locality play in this process? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>There is growing interest as to the ways in which ethnically complex populations routinely interact in convivial and competent ways. Exploring the dynamics and limits of this competency&amp;nbsp; - and its relationship to places that have long and short histories of multiculture - is at the heart of the research. In a context of dispersing multiculture the need to focus on issues of space and place is particularly important since less research has been done on suburbs, large towns and small cities with little or no histories of multiculture and/or ethnic tension.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />The project's core aims are to contribute to new social and spatial understandings of multiculture and to inform appropriate policy responses. It employs a mixed methodology in three case study areas chosen for the different windows they offer onto the new geographies of multiculture in England.This methodological approach combines one-to-one semi-structured interviews, repeat in-depth discussion groups and participant observation. Informed by psychotherapeutic approaches these methods allow the research team to observe, experience and ask about the types of social relations, convivial exchanges and quotidian skills that underpin lived multiculture. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is timely. Current policy interest in the possibilities of localism and civic society for achieving social inclusion and well-being mean that the project's potential impact is significant. One of the central ambitions of this project is to highlight ways in which contemporary policy making in the field of ethnic and cultural diversity might usefully engage with geographically embedded, local, everyday practices of multicultural encounter and social interaction, rather than starting from a dichotomy between cultural difference and community cohesion that currently tends to dominate policy debates. 

There are four main aspects to the way in which the research will dialogically involve and impact with policy makers and users.

The first relates to local policy actors. We will be working closely with a local advisory group drawn from the three case study sites of Oadby, Milton Keynes and Hackney, whose members will be selected from among key individuals within policy and user networks across the public and third and community sectors. This group will operate in ways that enable and encourage an active process of knowledge exchange between the group, their networks and the research team.

The second relates to the national level. At this level we will organise interim and end-of-project workshops, aimed at engaging with wider audiences drawn from public policy and third sector organisations. As well as allowing us to report on emergent findings, again the purpose will be to facilitate knowledge exchange, encouraging and enabling participants to suggest ways in which the project might fruitfully be developed. They will be an opportunity for dialogue, rather than exposition. We will also ensure that work in progress is reported to a range of other workshops and seminars during the course of the project as well as preparing interim policy briefs. This process will culminate in a major international workshop towards the end of the project, where a wide audience from across the policy/academic divide will be invited to engage with the work that is emerging from the project.

The third is centrally expressed in the project's research design. This recognises the need for an iterative, active and reflexive engagement with key stakeholders in order to feed in findings, discuss meanings, and 'test' interpretations and policy implications. Interviews with policy actors will include dialogue about the project's findings. The issues arising from the fieldwork will be discussed in a more detailed way with these actors right from the start and throughout the project. This iterative approach is not an optional extra but something that is closely integrated as an essential element in the project.

The fourth relates to the possibility and necessity of wider public engagement. We will be utilising various media to open up discussion around the project, including a project web-site (for the support of which dedicated resource has been identified), the use of a blog, pod casts through i-Tunes University and through radio programmes such as Radio 4's Thinking Allowed. A detailed communications strategy will be drawn up in the final year of the project with the help of the Open University's communications department.

Presenting information about the project and its findings fed into a series of networking conversations and interest among members of what was a multi-audience, policy focussed workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56360aac4abe47.60396207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multiculture , difference and solidarity amongst young people in education'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91847D0A-5080-4B58-8AB3-F49DBAB37DAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a presentation given to an international workshop in Belgium exploring solidarity in times of transiotion and migration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c041a732dbb3.28891011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation - 'Listening'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D491252A-EC44-482E-85FF-4F6F62939B0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper prompted a series of methods questions and discussions.

The research was completed in October 2014 at a time when debates about migration, community and cultural difference and social interaction have been pressing. As the ethnic diversity of the UK's population increases, becomes more complex and geographically dispersed the project investigated the social and spatial nature of contemporary urban multiculture. The findings from this two year, mixed qualitative methods study of multicultural social relations in three different areas of England engage directly with one of the most important aspects of everyday life in urban environments today. Our research starts from the profound understanding that contemporary Britain is defined through the experience of multiculture. As the 2011 Census confirms, there are very few places that have been unaffected by the shifts in population associated with longer term and more recent patterns of migration within and from beyond the UK. 

Britain is experiencing significant shifts in the geography of its multiculture. Some places are becoming more ethnically and culturally diverse while others are experiencing diversity for the first time. At the same time new migration settlements and the social mobility of older migrant communities mean that minority ethnic communities are becoming more diverse and socially differentiated. Such changes - often rapid - present major challenges for policy-makers and service provision at both national and local levels. 
Dominant interpretations of and policy responses to this process have often been trapped between a celebration of what has been called multiculturalism, a concern about challenges to community cohesion, and a fear of the emergence of forms of social and ethnic segregation as different ethnic groups have defined themselves in opposition to others. Sometimes, this is expressed as a concern about the extent to which 'Britishness' itself may be under challenge. 

Our work steps back from these debates to explore some of the meanings of urban multiculture in practice - neither celebrating nor bemoaning its social impact, but seeking to understand how people manage and live with ethnic diversity and cultural difference in everyday, mundane and even banal ways, as a fact of life. As part of this the findings suggest that residential affection for locality and place can become a socially cohesive experience as ethnically diverse populations demonstrated capacities and dispositions to connect to others through their affinities with where they live. Particularly important are the ways in which the 'soft infrastructure' of places - public and semi public spaces (parks, leisure centres, play areas, squares, cafes, libraries) - foster routine practices of being together which in turn generate familiar, mutually visible multicultural publics. The materialities of these spaces (plants and trees, benches, water, views, swings, food, books) were central to social interaction and place affection. Having such 'belonging' spaces, which are used by different populations, is a key aspect of navigating cultural difference. The identification of 'urban craft' or 'competencies' in the social life of 'placed' populations provides evidence of multiculture and diversity becoming an unexceptional norm, confirming that conflict and anxiety are not the only - or even the dominant modes - of interaction between culturally different populations. 
As a result not only are our findings directly relevant to the development of policy around the new realities of life in Britain today, but they build on activity that is already taking place, both within communities and in some of the prosaic work of local policy practice.

Project Impacts: networking and engagement routes

The research process (as discussed in a paper published in Qualitative Research in 2015 see RF entry) was one that was understood to be a collaborative, co-productive process between researcher and researched - as we sought to have impact through what we describe as an on-going process of embedded practice in line with our broader commitment to recognising the significance of the everyday and the importance of the apparently slight. This embedded practice has involved us in thinking differently about 'policy', moving away from a focus on 'from above' policy models and decision making and instead highlighting those quotidian practices that shape how people negotiate and accommodate difference in different places which have distinct identities and migration histories. In this way the project engaged with the ways in which policy imaginations and interventions might recognize the impact of the everyday, the experiential and the emotional aspects of living diversity and find ways of mobilising this recognition into policy thinking. Making places liveable and cohesive for very diverse, complex local populations alongside addressing social exclusion, social strain and racism in wider contexts of anti-migration and diversity anxiety are a key challenges for local policy makers and those with responsibilities for community well-being responsibilities. 

The individual interviews and repeated focus groups with participants in the three geographies were constructed and pursued in ways that involved learning and dialogue between all of those involved. Throughout the process, our conceptual work and our field work was informed by discussion and engagement with a series of locally based project advisory groups (PAGs) which were established at the beginning of the project. 

The research team met with each PAG on a twice-yearly basis during the lifetime of the project to report on the project's progress and on our emergent findings and from whom we received feedback, advice and suggestions and with whom we maintained contact. In each project locality, these project advisory groups were made up of a variety of actors drawn from a diverse range of local community and third sector organisations such as Parks Trusts, libraries, refugee groups and intercultural groups, FE and 6th form colleges and local authorities, as well as locally based, experienced community 'experts' and academics.

In the context of the 6th form and further education colleges with which we worked, these relationships were expressed in feedback sessions and other forms of engagement both to the students with whom we worked and the managers with whom we collaborated. In one case the project and their participation and engagement with it fed directly into the work being undertaken in preparation for an OFSTED inspection and an international observational visit from Scandinavian Educational Group aiming to learn from and develop strategies for ethnic diversity in education. In this particular college setting the project also invited to attend the management board meetings and presented findings from the project to the Governors and College Management Committee. In another of the project's FE colleges the project's findings informed college thinking and policy on the internal architecture and student use of social spaces.

The final phase of the project involved a series of what we describe as 'iterative interviews' and extensive discussions with national and local policy actors, involved in community organisations, third sector organisations and local government within the three geographical areas and at a national level. This iterative process involved the research team in providing summaries of our findings prior to the interview and then using these as the basis of questions and conversation as we sought to both disseminate and to learn from their responses, which fed into the policy brief we prepared summing up our policy relevant findings and setting out policy lessons, which has been made available both on-line and in hard copy (and circulated to a wider policy audience). 

Societal impacts: wider audiences and on-going project engagement

We have consistently sought to take the work of the project to a wider set of audiences. We organised a series of project public encounters at the beginning of the project; mid point when we organised a well attended interim findings workshop to ensure that wider audiences could have an opportunity to respond to our work and make suggestions for its next stages; and end of project workshop to encourage a debate around the issues we raised. All of these workshops drew in audiences, research participants and included presentations from beyond the academy (including the Equalities and Human Rights Council and the Runnymede Trust). Locally one member of the research team developed work from the project to contribute to a series of workshops organised by the Fred Roche Foundation which focused on the future of Milton Keynes.

Throughout the project we also maintained a well-used project web site, where we provided key project information, discussed progress, developed blogs and provided access to findings, publications and policy briefs. Our work has also attracted media interest on which we aim to build. For example, an academic (Royal Geographic Society) conference presentation (see RF for details) on the extent to which particular places (such as the London Borough of Hackney) become the subject of 'over-research' by social researchers led to reports about the project and its scope in the Times Higher Education (https://timeshighereducation.com/news/hackney -has-become-focus-of-academic-study/2015471.article) and, with our work on brand caf&amp;eacute; spaces, we have been invited to contribute to the Radio 4 programme 'Thinking Allowed' in December 2015. 

Research team members have continued to build networks and present the project and its findings at conferences and a variety of multi-audience workshops - for example, we participated in a landscape design workshop hosted by University of Sheffield which consisted of landscape planners, local authority service providers and academics. The project has also had some transnational policy reach. In 2014, we were invited to contribute to wider European audiences through a participation in a Warsaw based conference, sponsored by the Mayor of Gdansk, on the theme of Smart Cities, where we highlighted the importance of cosmopolitan understanding in the construction of Smart Cities, moving beyond a simple emphasis on technology in contemporary urban space. This presentation was selected for further development and translated into Polish for inclusion in the official publication that arose from the conference (see RF for details).

We have agreed a book contract with Routledge to develop the arguments and present the evidence arising from the project. The aim of the book is not only to contribute to academic debates, but (equally important) also to engage with the wider policy initiatives about and popular experience of everyday life, rapidly changing places, place identities and the social connections between and across culturally different urban populations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>196E47D0-3E38-4688-924F-F84ADF33AA08</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5635eb6b7ea652.06073490</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to examine the importance of the everyday as the site of experiential multiculture at a time of rapid population change; develop such concepts as community and conviviality for understanding contemporary forms of cultural difference; focus on place as a way of materializing multiculture and emphasizing different multicultural formations; and contribute to local policy conversations about the possibilities of micro interactions for developing policy interventions. With this agenda the project has delivered significant theoretical and empirical findings regarding multicultural social relations in contemporary urban England. 

1. One key achievement has been to develop mixed qualitative methods approaches capable of investigating complex, ethnically diverse local populations and their senses of attachment to the places in which they live. Aspects of the project's fieldwork design and mixed qualitative methods approach - namely individual and then repeated group interviews - contribute to knowledge and understanding about how to research sensitive and emotive fields of enquiry, productively working with participants and building strong relationships between research teams and research participants in localities. 

2. The project has mapped the heterogeneity of multicultural formations in urban England (bringing to life the results of the 2011 Census) - super-diverse, suburban and newly experienced multiculture - through accounts and insights of people's social life and practices within those contexts. In its identification of these different forms of multiculture and their relationship to particular places the data highlights the importance of developing a socially and spatially nuanced understanding of multiculture, which was also highlighted in the Commission on Integration and Cohesion's (2007) Our Shared Future report. The data suggest that people who live in multicultural places pursue strategies of accommodation, developing what might be called diversity skills and competencies.

3. Residential affection for locality and place can become a socially cohesive experience as ethnically diverse populations demonstrated capacities and dispositions to connect to others through their affinities with where they live. Particularly important are the ways in which the 'soft infrastructure' of places - public and semi public spaces (parks, leisure centres, play areas, squares, cafes, libraries) - foster routine practices of being together which in turn generate familiar, mutually visible multicultural publics. The materialities of these spaces (greenness, benches, water, views, swings, food, books) were central to social interaction and place affection. Having such 'belonging' spaces, which are used by different populations, is a key aspect of managing cultural difference. 

4. The identification of an 'urban learning process' in the social life of emplaced populations provides evidence of multiculture and diversity becoming an unexceptional norm, confirming that conflict and anxiety are not the only - or even the dominant modes - of interaction between culturally different populations. The research found that direct interaction itself was not necessary for senses of connection to exist; ethnic mixity in certain public and semi-public environments could itself be sufficient to generate positive expressions of diversity. This finding opens up new research questions regarding how affections for places are developed and reinforced among different populations.


5. The research findings highlight the importance of conviviality even in the absence of the deep roots of implied by notions of community. While community remains a core concept drawn on by participants to describe their lives and localities the data show that what is described as having a sense of community is often a series of more momentary exchanges or experiences which linger in the mind rather than 'knowing your neighbour' type social relations. The research re-excavates older sociological concepts such as Goffman's 'civil inattention' and Granovetter's 'strength of weak ties' to suggest that processes of proximate living with culturally different others is managed through thin, low demand, convivial sociality rather than the thicker structures of community.

6. The research suggests that policy interventions and local initiatives around localized urban social relations, working with everyday, micro worlds may provide ways of effectively framing and mobilizing policy approaches to increasingly complex local populations, particularly through the ways in which convivial, public space with multicultural appeal might be most effectively designed, developed and maintained.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are being disseminated through a combined strategy of engagement with academic and non-academic audiences. 

In relation to academic audiences papers have been presented to a wide range of national and international conferences and invited workshops (as indicated elsewhere in Researchfish); papers have been and are being prepared for publication in academic journals (one is in press with Population, Space and Place, one due for publication in The Sociological Review, subject to minor corrections, two are under review and three currently in development); a book proposal is being prepared and interest has been expressed by publishers (the plan is for the manuscript to be complete by December 2015). 

In terms of wider impact three distinct aspects to the strategy can be identified: first, we have been committed to engaging and disseminating to locally based, practitioner-professional audiences (for example, the interactive interviews with policy figures, the three Advisory Groups which met three times in each locality); second, we have made presentations to mixed professional-practitioner-participant audiences and organised seminars and workshops involving them (for example, the project launch, interim findings and end of project workshops held in September 2013, September 2014 and October 2015); third, we have prepared and will further develop a series of policy-orientated briefing papers available from the project web-site and also sent to key local and national organisations who have been involved in the project or who are working in social cohesion and related fields.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>90C60667-2061-4473-9980-8C07F05F0A3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54c8e8736bd546.93569173</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www8.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/living-multiculture/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>32134D33-1249-4FA0-9B03-36B466740804</gtr:id><gtr:title>Urban Multiculture and Everyday Encounters in Semi-Public, Franchised Cafe Spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Sociological Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad4e367dce760a50f40f833b1483bf98"><gtr:id>ad4e367dce760a50f40f833b1483bf98</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5461fa60908075.84536840</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B2DEFCD-BEEC-44B0-94FE-781E7F1FA14E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Listening</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Emotion, Space and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63c19f29124df85180acb73f5f3c1540"><gtr:id>63c19f29124df85180acb73f5f3c1540</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bennett K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675ee7bcf94c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>425FC64A-2F23-413F-B5F3-0BCE9FC1B7C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Living multiculture: understanding the new spatial and social relations of ethnicity and multiculture in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea5eb87117967c6d65c09a1efbc071fa"><gtr:id>ea5eb87117967c6d65c09a1efbc071fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Neal S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0390395487d98</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FD2C6721-F075-49A6-90D3-685FB49FC51A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Negotiating the educational spaces of urban multiculture: Skills, competencies and college life</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Urban Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/63c19f29124df85180acb73f5f3c1540"><gtr:id>63c19f29124df85180acb73f5f3c1540</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bennett K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c03e856349d5.90695120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E53323DB-A421-47FB-943D-950BC7B74441</gtr:id><gtr:title>fifty years on</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethnic and Racial Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea5eb87117967c6d65c09a1efbc071fa"><gtr:id>ea5eb87117967c6d65c09a1efbc071fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Neal S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54621cf6ca1511.21246554</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C33F4B10-8AA8-4327-8C7F-400DE10F830C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Zycie w obliczu innosci, czyli: jak zrozumiec wsp&amp;oacute;lczesne miasta [Living with difference: making sense of the contemporary city]</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7fc08750591b0d6d08f7da6a608331cb"><gtr:id>7fc08750591b0d6d08f7da6a608331cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cochrane, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5635f63fc503d0.60642212</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71D6D6AA-39B2-4592-A7D1-E21E633AD83D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Lived Experience of Multiculture: the new social and spatial relations of diversity.
