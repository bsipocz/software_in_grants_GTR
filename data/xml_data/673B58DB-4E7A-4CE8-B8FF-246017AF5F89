For example, malaria-infected mosquitoes take larger blood meals than uninfected ones, and will take multiple blood meals. In a pilot study, conducted recently by the applicants, we demonstrated that females of one of the most important African malaria mosquito species Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto infected with Plasmodium falciparum, one of the most important parasites that causes malaria in human beings, were significantly more attracted to human odours than uninfected mosquitoes. This was the first demonstration of a change in An. gambiae s.s. behaviour in response to human odours caused by infection with the malaria parasite P. falciparum. This behaviour is of fundamental importance since it will enhance the efficiency of disease transmission. We propose to explore the mechanisms for this response. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that P. falciparum parasites manipulate the olfactory system of host-seeking An. gambiae female mosquitoes making them more sensitive to host stimuli and this causes infected mosquitoes to be more attracted to human hosts.

We propose to build on our preliminary study to quantify, using a windtunnel bioassay, the behavioural responses of An. gambiae s.s. female infected with human malaria parasites, P. falciparum, compared to uninfected females and determine whether the response depends on the lifecycle stage of the parasites within the mosquito. We will use olfactometer studies, which are designed to measure the behavioural response of the insects to human odours, within specially designed secure laboratories at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. To determine the effect of a Plasmodium infection on the olfactory system (i.e. the mosquito's sense of smell), we will use an electrophysiology technique which allows us to record the response of the mosquito's antenna to individual compounds within the complex mixture that makes up human body odour. This, along with other state-of-the-art analytical chemistry techniques, will allow us to identify the volatile compounds that the mosquito can detect and to determine whether infected mosquitoes respond differently to the odorous volatiles emitted by humans to uninfected mosquitoes.

The results of our study will provide information that could be used to illuminate how malaria is transmitted between human beings by An. gambiae s.s. females. Importantly, new attractive compounds could be identified which could be used to develop improved mosquito traps for surveillance or trapping programmes that may even specifically target P. falciparum-infected An. gambiae s.s. females. This study will be a fundamental example of how parasites are able to manipulate their host to increase their own reproductive fitness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is considerable evidence that pathogens manipulate the behaviour of their vectors to enhance pathogen transmission. For example, malaria-infected mosquitoes take larger blood meals than uninfected ones, and take multiple blood meals. We have recently demonstrated that P. falciparum-infected An. gambiae females were significantly more attracted to human odours than uninfected females. This was the first demonstration of a change in An. gambiae behaviour in response to olfactory stimuli caused by infection with P. falciparum. Despite the clear impact on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, parasite-mediated behaviour of haematophagous insects in response to host odours, and the chemistry and olfactory mechanisms underlying the behavioural responses, have not been elucidated. The hypothesis of this study is that P. falciparum manipulates the olfactory system of infected An. gambiae mosquitoes, causing them to be more attracted to human hosts.

We propose to build on our preliminary study to quantify, using olfactometer studies within BSL-3 laboratories at LSHTM, the behaviour of An. gambiae females infected with human malaria parasites, P. falciparum, and compare these responses to uninfected females, and determine whether the responses depend on the lifecycle stage of the parasites. Electrophysiological experiments will be done to examine whether P. falciparum infection has an effect on the olfactory system. New compounds (or blends) could be identified, using sophisticated analytical chemistry techniques, which could be exploited to develop a synthetic lure for application in surveillance or trapping programmes specifically targeting P. falciparum infected An. gambiae s.s. females. 

This study represents a novel piece of biology exploring the olfactory mechanisms by which parasites enhance their transmission success. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to examine this type of behavioural manipulation by a parasite.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although there is ample evidence that pathogens manipulate the behaviour of their vectors to enhance pathogen transmission, and despite the impact on the epidemiology of vector borne diseases, parasite-mediated behaviour of haematophagous insects in response to host odours have hardly been studied. We propose to examine the vector-parasite-host interaction of Anopheles gambiae s. s. - Plasmodium falciparum, one of the most important interactions in the context of humanity, with malaria causing over 200 million human malaria cases and over 770 thousand deaths each year, and having a negative impact on the economic growth of the countries affected. The research in this proposal is likely to be of wide public interest and should generate high impact publications. 

The development of novel and highly effective synthetic attractive blends for P. falciparum infected An. gambiae s.s. females will benefit researchers in the area of mosquito control, ecology and behaviour and control programmes that require improved monitoring systems. It will also generate new intellectual property which will be exploited appropriately by the partner institutions and could lead to the development of a product which would be marketed to mosquito surveillance and control programmes as well as the domestic pest control market world-wide. Current methods for monitoring and control of malaria mosquitoes rely mainly on human subjects or CO2. The former has ethical concerns, whereas the latter is not mosquito specific and its attractiveness to An. gambiae s.s. females increases enormously when combined with human odours. Using volatile blends selectively attractive to infected mosquitoes will, in combination with other measures, disrupt contact between infected mosquitoes and humans and therefore malaria incidence. Mass trapping of infected mosquitoes using the newly developed odour baits could, in the long term, create an evolutionary pressure for mosquitoes not being infected. In the long term, the health of travellers and local people in malaria endemic countries (particularly young children and pregnant women) will be substantially improved which will positively affect economic growth in sub-Saharan malaria endemic countries. Additionally, the development and commercial exploitation of novel mosquito control technologies will enhance the economic competitiveness of the UK. 

The scientific knowledge gained from the proposed project will enable epidemiologists to improve mathematical models used to predict disease transmission and to plan mosquito control and elimination strategies. Including the effect of parasites on mosquito host-seeking behaviour in the models will increase the reliability of the models and therefore the impact of mosquito control strategies that are implemented based on the predictions of the models. 

Additionally, the results of this project will be relevant to other systems where parasites manipulate their hosts and thus, the findings will also be of benefit to evolutionary biologists. It is likely that new avenues of research will be generated (for example understanding the mechanisms of manipulation by parasites at the molecular level; and understanding finer details of the olfactory system, such as olfactory receptors and odourant binding proteins). The project will build on the current knowledge of the individual investigators involved and new skills and knowledge will be gained during the proposed project that will be useful in future projects. The project will also create foundations for a strong collaborative relationship between the investigators and advisors beyond the proposed project, enabling them to target jointly other parasite-insect-host interactions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>463905</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Vanderbilt University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>ORN collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>19772298-4B83-43B9-8452-A654C2EF1372</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5469c3ded6d4d5.47846823-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The collaborator will perform molecular investigations using material from our studies at LSHTM.

This was a challenging aspect of the project because this vector-pathogen system is notoriously difficult to establish and maintain and there are few labs around the world with this capacity. A substantial effort was directed at optimising the system and we are now able to produce mosquitoes that survive through to the sporozoite (infectious) stage of infection. Despite the success, the resources required to maintain the cultures and infections are far greater than anticipated and it has been an ongoing challenge to achieve consistent infections. The facilities at the School are not of the quallity required to maintain consistent infections. Nevertheless, despite these major hurdles, our studies have shown that mosquitoes respond signficantly less to human odours at the early stage of malaria infection and more to human odours at the later stage of malaria infection, thus supporting our original hypothesis. We also investigated whether the increased behavioural response of mosquitoes to human odour during infection was due to changes in the peripheral olfactory system of the mosquito. By using gas chromatography coupled with electrophysiology (GC-EAG) we have demonstrated that mosquitoes at different stages of infection respond differently to volatiles from human hosts. There are qualitative differences in the types of compounds that mosquitoes respond to when infected, regardless of infection stage, compared with uninfected mosquitoes. There are also distinct differences between infection stages - mosquitoes at the early stage of infection (oocyst stage) respond to 6 compounds that uninfected and late stage mosquitoes do not respond to. Since mosquitoes respond to human odour less at the early stage, these compounds could be repellents. Additionally, there are 8 further compounds that late stage (sporozoite) infected mosquitoes only respond to. Since mosquitoes find human odour more attractive at the late stage of infection, these compounds could be attractants that are used specifically by sporozoite-infected mosquitoes. Some of the compounds have never been described in association with mosquitoes before and could therefore be novel attractants. Dose response EAG studies are almost complete and, once analysed, will reveal whether there are differences in sensitivity of infected and uninfected mosquitoes, and between different stages of infection, which may help to explain the qualitative differences in the GC-EAG experiments. We have used coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to tentatively identify almost 25 compounds and confirmations have been successfully done via peak enhancement by co-injection with authentic samples. In addition to the experiments above with Anopheles gambiae, we have also investigated the response of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Those studies are complete and reveal differences between the species which may be due to adaptive evolutionary mechanisms between specific malaria parasite and mosquito species. Furthermore, we have investigated the effect of blood feeding on the response of mosquitoes to human odours. We have discovered that mosquitoes respond differently to human odour when partially blood-fed which could occur in addition to the changes caused by infection. This is relevant because mosquitoes that are infected are known to take multiple blood meals and are therefore more likely to re-feed when partially blood fed in the field than uninfected mosquitoes. Further work is examining possible mechanisms underlying the manipulation of mosquito olfaction by malaria parasites. 
We have tested some of the identified compounds in behavioural experiments to determine whether they produced a differential behavioural response. We observed no significant changes in behavioural response. However, the replication was too low because we could not achieve consistent infections during the time period allocated to the behvaioural work, and this experiment would need to be redone.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the findings are new and therefore open up new avenues and opportunities for research on the mechanisms underlying behavioural manipulation of mosquitoes by malaria parasites. This will be of interest to academic researchers in the field of molecular biology and neurophysiology, as well as evolutionary biology. The identification of novel compounds for manipulating mosquito behaviour will create opportunities for investigations into monitoring malaria vectors in the field, which in turn, could result in better surveillance and therefore directly influence policy and practice in the longer term. The identification of compounds associated with early stage infection may lead to the development of new repellents. As well as generating new avenues for research, these findings may be of interest to industry who may seek to develop new vector control tools such as traps and repellents. Our study also provides important information about the feeding behaviour of mosquitoes which could impact on mathematical modelling of malaria.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1FF7EFDA-5985-42C9-9334-AD603472CB55</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5469c7599b83d6.48869707</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J008869/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7135270D-AD00-45BB-B94D-B6516BADEB67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Parasitology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
