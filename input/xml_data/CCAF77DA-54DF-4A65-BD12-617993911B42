International volunteering is described predominantly in two domains; one associated with international tourism (volunteer tourism, voluntourism - a more recent phenomena) and the other with international development. There are also aspects that cross these domains, for example: diaspora volunteering, health volunteering, and humanitarian volunteering increasing the complexity. What is clear is that in economically challenging times, volunteering effort is considered an essential component in delivering a better quality of life, protecting the environment, assisting less-privileged societies and developing responsible citizens for future generations. But there is also criticism: that the resources contributed by volunteers could be better used; that volunteers can be ill-equipped and exposed to unnecessary danger; that the receiving community fails to benefit adequately from the volunteers effort; and that not all companies offer the same quality of experience and ethical values.

'Volunteering', 'development' and 'tourism' have all been discussed within national (domestic) and international contexts and underpinned by a range of disciplines, most notably sociology, development studies, leisure studies, tourism studies and management and business studies. However what is less evident are discussions bringing these fields together and opening up debate about the overlaps and mismatches between the volunteering experience in practice and the purported theoretical underpinning. These mismatches are also evident in practitioner debates where not-for-profit companies (predominantly associated with development initiatives) criticise more commercial tourism operators, only to change their own services later to stay competitive in a complex, fragmented and changing marketplace. The growing levels of criticism around international volunteering are evident in many arenas; in academic literature, practitioner comments and media reports.
Individuals, practitioners, communities and governments as well as researchers therefore need to engage in 'reconceptualising' their perceptions of volunteering and particularly international volunteering as both a theoretical and a practical undertaking. This seminar series is designed to offer an opportunity to do just this: recognising the need to broaden discussions beyond any single academic field; engaging international speakers from all the areas under discussion and ensuring that practitioners are fully engaged with academic researchers. The series is both innovative and timely in addressing these discourses. Whilst the seminar series may not answer all the questions, it will engage in informed discourses that help formulate future research agendas that are international in focus.

Seminar Series therefore aims:
- To bring together policy makers, academics and practitioners and to explore the dynamics between volunteering, development and tourism in an international context.
- To draw on a number of research fields and academic disciplines to develop an holistic appreciation of international volunteering in the twenty first century. 
- To engage with practitioners in order to develop best practice and ensure the sustainability of the sector.
- To open up new research agendas examining under explored areas. 
- To build research capacity by engaging early career researchers and post graduate.
- To inform future policy developments by bringing together policy-makers and world experts in debate.

These proposed seminars are already attracting a lot of interest from not-for-profit organisations offering volunteer opportunities, who're indicating their desire to use the series to inform the development of good practice within their organisations and through contributing to the development of a British Standard for Assuring quality in the sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This seminar series is designed to have impact beyond the immediate group of academic researchers - the whole proposition is an engagement between a range of stakeholders and different areas of international volunteering in international development and scientifically orientated volunteer tourism. The industry letters of support make it clear that there are recognised needs in this grouping for a wider framing of the contextual issues that they face. These include in particular the issues of assuring quality in the sector in terms of delivering on volunteers' objectives and ensuring their safety, alongside delivering sustainable and ethical impact to the local communities receiving volunteers and adding value to the projects for which the volunteers sign up.

The seminar series therefore has relevance to a range of non-academic beneficiaries- carefully considered when putting the series together. The applicants will seek to maximize the impact of the series and have therefore identified key target groups and considered the impact in terms of the short-, medium- and longer-term actions:
1) Practitioners / Organisations (Corporations, SMEs, profit and non-profit NGOs). Practitioners are fully engaged in the speaker programme and the letters of support also indicate organisations that are intending to participate and are seeking to adopt/adapt results in their practice. Some of the organisations indicate they have already been impacted by the pre-cursor ESRC Festival of Social Science event in 2013 and this series will help to build awareness and work towards best practice initiatives. 
2) Policy makers and officials. The results should inform those involved in initiatives such as DFID's International Citizens' Service (ICS) to further understand the volunteers' challenges and improve the scheme, as well as other Aid agencies internationally, helping to promote British expertise as leading global practice. Governments will also benefit from the impact on practitioners, including both governments who are actively engaged (e.g. Ghana, Tanzania) and those who are currently passive but where international volunteer organisations send large numbers of volunteers (e.g. Madagascar). The British Standards Institute will gain from the additional impetus for plans to define an international standard for the quality of volunteering opportunities and to develop a best-practice guide.
3) Volunteers and extended family networks: Future volunteers will benefit from improved quality and raised expectation that they 'make a difference' and from the equality of opportunity and improved quality in their projects - leading to fewer misconceptions and premature returns, and more effective use of the funds they raise for the projects. Extended family networks will also feel benefits as youths' International Volunteer experience is often financially supported by parents, grandparents etc. and they will particularly appreciate improved safety for their young family members who volunteer. 
4) Targeted communities who host projects should see more effective projects, better-informed facilitating organisations and more-engaged volunteers. 
5) Journalists - as a source for journalists, who are increasingly aware, currently resulting in extensive media coverage of volunteering. 

Short-term impact: through speakers and attendees engaging with each other. Support is already strong as evidenced by (a) table 1 (case for support) showing that &amp;gt;80% of speakers have already accepted; (2) table 2 listing 21 people who wanting to be involved and (3) the 7 letters of support. 

Medium term impact: mainly by working with the BSI on an initiative resulting from the pre-cursor Festival of Social Science workshop on 'Pursuing Quality in International Volunteering' and through the adoption of results in participating companies best practices

Longer Term impact: through spreading good practice and reference publications (book and journal special issues</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
