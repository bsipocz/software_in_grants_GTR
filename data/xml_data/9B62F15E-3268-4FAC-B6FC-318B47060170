Investigations of The Event, its Record and the Aesthetics of Witnessing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/F013728/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In 1994 I proposed two photo projects to Esquire Magazine the first, called 'After the Event', featured sportsmen whose portraits I would make immediately after they had finished competing at the highest level. My interest was in the visibility of the event in their faces, the residue of stress, thought, pain and competitive intensity. The results were extraordinary, a rugby league player carried a detailed map of the physical engagement. His face was streaked with blood and mud and his eyes were hard with anger and frustration. A racing driver appeared utterly drained by his exertions while a boxer with ice strapped to his hands and sweat pouring down his face was all vanity and arrogance.\n\nI have long had an interest in exploring what one might call the traces of events in performers and their stages or performing arenas. In conversations while compiling the Tate book LIVE, Adrian Heathfield, a leading authority on performance and live art, told me that he often thought that my photographs themselves became events. This sounded extraordinary to me, flattering. However, later I suspected that what he meant was that many events that I photograph, dance, theatre or performance art in this case, have meta-events or micro-events hidden within them, visible to a camera trawling fragments of seconds of time but invisible to the viewer watching the complexity of real time occurrence. The only evidence of this event can be the photograph and as such the photograph becomes the event. Yet if my first understanding of his words has some truth then there must be some kind of transformation happening when I take a picture. The decisions I make in space and time, the aesthetics I apply to those fragments all work to produce a document that works as a record of something that happened, but at the same time generates a new kind of object that on one level works as its own primary text while being firmly wedded to another text as a secondary source. The relationship between and elision of these two states is the territory that I need to understand more in order to take my work further. \n\nThe questions I would like to pursue have to do with my position in the work, whether my presence in the work, for instance, should be visible. I also wish to know how I can be true to the artists that are my subjects and reflect and frame their work as the documentation asserts itself as a primary text. I wonder what the similarities and differences are between performances or events framed within theatrical conventions and performances or events that occur in the 'real' world. I'm also interested in investigating how theatrical performance space changes the way one perceives performances. Finally, the photographic witnessing of events or performances precludes other involvements and sets the witness apart. This, I believe, is the place of the voyeur. So, I wonder, whether the aesthetic choices made by the photographer excuse this passivity and whether there is an ethical dimension to witnessing that could curtail or extend my work.\n\nMy aims are to advance this project's key questions in a research through practice, creating a series of photographic projects, exhibitions, and publications, while embracing theoretical reflections and dialogues over these outcomes; to develop as an artist by entering into a self-reflexive critique of my position as witness and to evidence this in my work. The project outcomes wil be: a book (Phaidon) and an exhibition (Kunsten Festival Brussels) of the photographic work 'Empty Stages; a DVD of LAX, a lecture on Live Art restaged exclusively for this project; the publication of 'The Corridor Project' in a refereed journal (Performance Research); a documentation of Live Art in a book accompanying a large exhibition and colloquium (Tramway Glasgow) and the artwork 'Watching the Detectives' which will form the basis of at least one journal article (Leonardo).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F013728/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
