In construction, design is undertaken as a collaborative activity by necessity, due to the division of labour and expertise between organisations (Bresnen et al., 2005). A consequence of the structure of the sector is that design activity involves the coordination of complex information exchanges in multi-disciplinary design teams. Coordination and communication challenges underlie difficulties in the integration of work activities of design teams. Communication is central to design collaboration and the coordination of design inputs, yet the communicative practices that coordinate design activities remain under-researched.Design team meetings are the locus for activities that are difficult to replicate in technologically-mediated environments (Visser, 2007). Indeed, it is the nuanced, micro-interactional communicative practices that are difficult to replicate but are significant for some shared understanding of a design situation that will be studied through this research. Face-to-face design interactions involve discursive moves where changes to the design are made verbally. In conversation designers with different knowledge backgrounds will negotiate design problems and verbally test alternate design solutions. It is these interactional, self-organising practices that coordinate real-time design activity that will be examined. The coordination of design activities will be investigated as this happens in the collaborative practices and communicative actions of cross-functional teams in design meeting settings. The face-to-face interactions of designers will be analysed from a language-use perspective, where the actions and practices that accomplish design coordination (or misunderstanding, ambiguity and uncertainty) will be investigated. From a conversation analytic-informed perspective patterns of interaction, spoken actions and particles in speech that mark shifts in understanding in the process of design will be analysed to locate interactional cues and communicative practices of design coordination. An intention is to link an understanding of structures and patterns in conversation with the way that engineering and construction management research communities understand design processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Collaborating with an international design consultancy, Atkins, the research will develop their design practices and improve the project delivery processes of an organisation that exports design products and services. Impacts will be at individual and organisational levels in national and international markets. Atkins will benefit from improved ways of working collaboratively in teams. Improved design coordination will enhance project efficiencies with economic impacts both for Atkins' profitability and UK competitiveness. Impacts on the design practitioners who are part of the case study project include knowledge transfer with the research team over the lifespan of the research, as design coordination practices are observed, analysed and discussed. The Workshop is a dedicated dissemination event and a learning opportunity for the design practitioners to engage in critical reflection on their working practices. Support for the proposed research will be an investment in skills development and competences for the design practioners involved. The practioners will have enhanced practical understanding of design coordination practices and developed design coordination skills as an outcome of the research. These skills are important for soft innovation in the design of aesthetic products as well as impacting on competitiveness. Social impacts include learning benefits and skills enhancement, which are important to employment prospects in a less buoyant market. Developing the creative competencies of design practioners and design teams will be beneficial to UK competitiveness in national and international markets. The materials developed for the Workshop will be a more permanent record of teaching and learning approaches for the research team to apply in other situations, e.g. materials to use at the University of Reading with part-time master students on the Design Management module. This dissemination route will enable outcomes from the research to become embedded in teaching practices and more broadly available to design management and construction project management practioners studying part-time (approx. 75 practitioners/year). This route for dissemination will impact over a long time as the course delivered annually. An impact will be on enhancing the design coordination and communication skills of those involved with the case study project. These are transferable skills and this manner there will be diffusion of practical know-how with other practitioners, so the research impact will be broader than the case study design team. Planned dissemination within the timescale of the research includes posting bulletin updates on research progress to Atkins Global's intranet. In this way knowledge of research activities and the collaboration between Atkins and the University of Reading will be broadly publicised throughout the Atkins organisation internationally. An intension is that lessons learnt from the UK-based case study are made available throughout Atkins Global. Atkins contribution to the transfer includes permission to publicise the research and the use of intranet infrastructure. Potentially the research will impact on export design practices and services. Knowledge transfer will occur through the various networks that the applicant is involved with. Policy makers, industry bodies and knowledge transfer networks the PI engages with include: Constructing Excellence, RIBA, DIUS, NESTA design networks provide opportunities for the research findings and knowledge of the research project to be discussed amongst broad design and construction communities. The PI has ties with design and communication researchers and the research will be discussed through these informal networks as it progresses. The PI is intermittently invited to present her research to broad audiences and these occasions provide opportunities for knowledge transfer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B85E7B9-A646-4866-B389-0F4EA5D279B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prompted reflection and discussion of their work practices, how projects are organised, meetings staged, ways of sharing design information throughout the team.

The research project changed the participants' appreciation how their individual actions worked towards the coordination of the design of the project. Highlighting that some small actions in conversation, with reference to drawings, models and other materials, were seen to be mechanisms coordinating their design inputs. The participants were able to re-visit what happened on the project, to reflect on how to change their ways of working. As a team they also reflected on how BIM changed what they did and how it might be used differently. An impact of the research was the practitioners' reflection on their own socio-cultural design practices. Scaling up this new understanding of what design coordination involves, across other projects within the organisation, was beneficial to promote Multi-disciplinarity as an economic way of working.

This research drew attention to the various locations where design work takes place, even within an office. There was a changed understanding that where design takes place does impact on the coordination of a scheme. The construction sector has changed its practices and increasingly design teams with different disciplinary expertise are co-located in one office. This is a socio-cultural change in ways of working that is happening within an economic sector.

New opportunities that arose from this research project include changes in academic profile and progression for the PI, moving to another university. With this move there were invitations to present this research to new audiences, including part-time practitioners on masters courses at 3 other universities.

New networks and contacts with practitioners in architecture, structural engineering and multi-disciplinary design practices have led from this project. Other research themes and areas for study are now being taken forward with these new contacts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FF6116FF-2065-49E2-8423-34479A63E7E2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cdf8825d919.60233903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Multidisciplinarity, as a way of working was characterised through this research, where all the design disciplines working on a project work for the same organisation. Multidisciplinarity was seen to be an effective way of working, which has benefits in the rapid communication and coordination of activities between different disciplines. There are efficiency and productivity advantages from organising a design team in this way.

The research was able to demonstrate that design coordination is not just a role on a project, or something that is accomplished using BIM and other project software. Design coordination was seen to be a social accomplishment, which involves members of the team maintaining close awareness of others actions. 

This research was able to show just how design work was coordinated on a project. This involved the detailed analyses of the actions and practices that organised the design inputs from architects, structural and M&amp;amp;E engineers, BREAM and HVAC energy consultants.

New research methods were applied in a construction setting, to study the coordination of design work in detail. This involved the micro-analysis of social interaction in authentic workplace settings. The data collection methods and analytic skills of the research team were developed through this research, including data sessions with experts in the analysis of social interaction at Kings College London and Loughborough University.

New questions that this research opens up concern the nature of design work and where it is located. Design work was seen to be distributed throughout an office environment, not just at a workstation or in meeting rooms but in other locations and remotely too. Questions that remain unanswered concern the characteristics of a design firm, its scale and size to profit from any efficiency gain in BIM. Clash detection is already available in CAD systems who, within a project team, benefits economically from BIM?

The use of BIM is now more common on projects. The changing roles of people with design coordination responsibility and changes in construction sector practices however are still not resolved.

New collaborations with industry practitioners have been forged through this research, including industry funding for practitioners to study design processes and practices though part-time phds.

New teaching practices have also been developed. The research has enabled new, more practical ways to teach and talk about the coordination of design work with students (practitioners with management responsibility). These materials are now being used on masters courses at 4 high-ranked universities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings were of primary relevance to the industrial partner, and the individual designers participating in the research who were able to re-view their working practices and reflect on how to change the ways they organise their design work.

Through teaching on several part-time modular masters courses this research reaches a wider practitioner audience than the original industry partner and project participants. 

This research is being taken forward in academic debate, through research that continues to examine the nature of design work and how it is organised and coordinated on construction projects. 

The published outputs from this project are a record of the ways that the coordination of design was changing on projects at that the time, through the introduction of BIM and the changing roles of people with design coordination responsibility on construction projects. These debates and changes in construction sector practices are not resolved.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6931CF99-E197-4DF9-B367-FD21FCE5237B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4458529329.354437775f5534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influencing the design practice of practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00559062-4627-4FF3-95BE-19A5AF40C072</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved the practitioner's reflection on how the communication of their design work affected the efficiencies in the coordination of a project.
