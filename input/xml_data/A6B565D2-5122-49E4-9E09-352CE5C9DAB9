call)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N00549X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Healthy water bodies provide a multitude of services that we as humans are dependent on. However, ensuring the sustainable management of these presents numerous challenges. This is because water bodies are affected by all the activities that occur on the land that drains into them, as well as by actions in abstracting, using and returning water. As a result numerous studies have identified that only coordinated action at the catchment level and involving all stakeholders responsible can ensure the protection and improvement of the water environment. 

In reflection of the need for more locally focused decision making at the catchment level the Government introduced the Catchment Based Approach (CaBA) to water management in 2013. This led to 100 Catchment Partnerships of stakeholders being established across the country. These partnerships provide an opportunity to engage local communities, charities and business in environmental planning. However, they will require access to information about the current and future risks to their catchments if they are to make well informed and sustainable decisions. They also require support in developing the tools and methods that can be used to plan at the catchment level. NERC's extensive research portfolio in the areas of water and land management presents an opportunity to provide this, demonstrating the impact that research can have not only in assisting with the delivery of public policy but also in improving public discourse and awareness of environmental problems.
 
The Catchment Planning and Management Knowledge Exchange Fellowship will investigate where there are data sets, monitoring results and information from NERC funded research programmes related to catchment management and translate these making them available and accessible for use in local decision making. The Fellow will also work with the Catchment Partnerships, support groups and national decision makers to investigate how to make data available and to demonstrate how they can be used to aid local understanding and planning. 

Ensuring that local decision makers have awareness of the services that the ecosystems within their catchments deliver will be essential if these are to be considered in planning that enables multiple benefits to be achieved. Therefore, the KE fellow will work to ensure that outputs from NERC's research programmes investigating ecosystem services, such as the Valuing Nature Programme and the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services Sustainability Programme, inform the development of the use of ecosystem services within catchment planning. This will improve understanding of how different ecosystem services can be valued and compared as well as understanding where the trade-offs between different ecosystem services may occur in order to facilitate planning. 

The KE Fellow will also work across NERC's research programmes and innovation programmes to provide Catchment Partnerships with access to outputs that communicate the importance of sustainable water management. This will help to ensure that a diverse range of individuals, groups and sectors are engaged in catchment planning. This will include NERC research into the links between the environment and human health and well-being as well as natural hazards, risks and infrastructure. This will assist with ensuring the involvement of a diverse range of individuals, groups and sectors such as health care professionals, social services, community groups, local authorities, spatial planners, transport providers, businesses etc. in order to support local environmental improvements. 

Following on from demonstrating the importance of engagement with catchment planning the KE fellowship will work to identify how NERC research can support the attraction of funding for environmental improvements identified at the local level, thus helping to ensure long term financial support for catchment management.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>132747</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Environment Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Environment Agency</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A60C801-C68A-426E-A641-2F0CA41D9103</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Briefing documents on the benefits of catchment management and collaborative processes

A large section of the work has focused on the use of ecosystem services and natural capital in urban environments. This was identified by the Fellowship's partners (Rivers Trust, Defra and Environment Agency) as an area requiring development. Working with the Fellowship's partners and the Westcountry Rivers Trust a method to capture the benefits of environmental improvements in urban areas was co-developed. This has been trialled in a number of urban areas including; Leicester, Manchester, the Thames Estuary and Southampton. The work has been used to engage Local Councils, Planners and environmental NGOs and to facilitate dialogue about how environmental improvements can be implemented. An example of the impact of this is that the work has been used to provide evidence for funding bids of over &amp;pound;1million in the Soar catchment. The work has also attracted attention of the Greater London Authority who have used the methodology to input into their review of the All London Green Grid. 
The Fellowship also enabled a collaboration with the Institute of Environmental Analytics who used the work on urban ecosystem services to create an online interactive communication tool which will facilitate the communication of the work with the general public. This has been created for the Manchester area and is being used in Defra's 25 Year environment Plan's Urban Pioneer. 
In addition to urban ecosystem services the Fellowship has also been working on communicating the benefits of catchment planning and management. A review of international literature identified evidence for this which was used to create briefing notes that have also been used to influence policy, particularly Defra's 25 Year Environment Plan. Following on from this the Fellowship developed a framework for capturing the benefits of catchment partnerships and the extent of collaborative working. This has been adopted by the Environment Agency and the Rivers Trust and has been used to report by the 106 catchment partnerships within the country. Future work of the fellowship will help to analysis the results. 
The final key area of impact concerns ensuring that policy and practice decision makers are engaged with relevant NERC research. In addition to giving a number of presentations there has been close working with policy makers in the area of drought and resilience. This led to the Fellowship organising and hosting a workshop attended by NERC researchers and Policy Makers where there was information exchange and also the creation of a list of research priorities. These were used to influence the final work package of NERC's Droughts and Water Scarcity research programme and letters of support being provided by Defra, including a commitment to provide input to the project. 




During the first few months of the Fellowship work has concentrated on understanding different groups research needs and introducing them to NERC's catchment science research. Input to Defra's work on integrated and partnership planning approaches to the environment has also been provided</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>160F1180-6DB0-4A8C-88AD-E78B9B409F7F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd60e6090620.96583133</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>March 2016-March 2017 
The Fellowship has led to the co-development of a method to assess and communicate ecosystem services and natural capital in urban environments. This has been used in Leicester, Manchester, Thames Estuary and Southampton. it has also been used by the Greater London Authority in their review of the All London Green Grid. In addition to this the work of the Fellowship has enabled a collaboration with the institute of Environmental Analytics (University of Reading)which has created an online visualisation of ecosystem services in Manchester. The Fellowship has enabled new partnerships between academics, local authorities and environmental NGOs by using the work on urban ecosystem services as an engagement and discussion tool. Furthermore, through workshops and presentations greater awareness of ecosystem services, methodology and NERC research has been promoted. 

The Fellowship has led to a systematic collation of the evidence for the benefits of catchment and partnership working, which is being used to ensure continued policy support for the Catchment Based Approach and to inform the 25 Year Environment Plan. A framework to assess the benefits of catchment management and collaborative working has been developed and used by 106 catchment partnerships. Current work is assessing the results provided. 

The Fellowship has brought together NERC researchers and policy and practice decision makers in the areas of drought and resilience. this has led to new shared research questions being developed and a commitment of academics and decision makers to work together on these. 



Nov 2015-March 2016
Funding has enabled two way knowledge exchange with those who plan environmental improvement works at the catchment level, e.g. Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, rivers trusts and Natural England. This has given greater understanding of the evidence needs whilst also introducing NERC's relevant research. It is clear that there are research needs especially around how to plan environmental improvements that account for multiple aspects e.g. water quality, flood protection, biodiversity etc so that integrated solutions can be implemented.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work on ecosystem services could be used in increased urban areas and there could be greater engagement and the development of skills in local authorities and catchment partnerships. The work could be used in the implementation of Defra's 25 Year Environmental Plan and work with the Urban Pioneer will continue. 
The framework to assess the benefits of partnership working could be utilised by other approached such as Local Nature Partnerships and also in assessing the effectiveness of the 25 year Environment Plan. 


The Fellowship will continue to work with decision makers to ensure that research needs related to planning at the catchment scale are met and informed by NERC's research</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4089C700-4FA9-4B2A-9FA8-E670F8409D92</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd70b4b7b1d1.28158542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://urbanwater-eco.services/lap-final-report-published/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Catchment Benefits Framework</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8435315-AFB9-487E-AB3F-0D9A5E9FF7B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Developed a framework to capture and assess the benefits of catchment planning and management.
