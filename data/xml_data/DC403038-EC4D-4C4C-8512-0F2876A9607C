This project is designed to investigate the premise that entertainment programming offers the opportunity to broaden the frameworks through which audiences understand the social world. With a consideration of case studies across a range of television genres and a range of subjects, it will examine the production processes involved in representing social issues and identify audience responses to such representations. Programming that offers discourses that challenge traditional and typical framings of controversial subjects will be of particular interest. Semi-structured interviews with media producers and audience focus groups will be utilised to generate richly detailed, qualitative data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As citizens increasingly turn to entertainment television over news and print media, the representation of social issues in primetime programming, the motivations and actions of producers and the responses of audiences require deeper critical exploration. How do media producers navigate the process of representing real-life social issues? How might unconventional discourses encourage audiences to think differently about subjects? What do these trends tell us about the possibilities and limitations of entertainment television as a representational tool? This project aims to address these questions and to deliver findings to both the academic and media producer communities. &lt;/p>

Dr Bethany Klein discussed her research into how TV drama reflects social issues and was joined by a panel of practitioner and academic experts. A lively Q&amp;amp;A session and discussion followed.

The BBC event was more high-profile than originally conceived, resulting in an excellent range of participants (panellists included director and writer Peter Kosminsky and EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown) and attendees (including BBC news and politics reporters, charity representatives and scholars in the field). The BBC College of Journalism's outputs, including a blog post (http://www.bbc.co.uk/ journalism/blog/2010/09/event-society-and-entertainmen.shtml) and YouTube video of the PI's talk (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVXxih1JHko), complemented the executive summary and talk prepared by the researchers for the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1045668759.42579352b016736</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/journalism/blog/2010/09/event-society-and-entertainmen.shtml</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has advanced the empirical understanding of producer and audience relationships to entertainment television that addresses social issues. Through interviews with writers, directors and producers, the project considered the delicate balance of roles and responsibilities generated by entertainment television content that offers unconventional perspectives on social issues. It revealed that programme makers may be hesitant to embrace the role of educator, but descriptions of their work suggest a critical pedagogic approach that encourages deliberation in the popular public sphere. Further, drawing on focus groups with television viewers in the UK, the project explored the ways in which audiences engage with and draw on entertainment television in discussions of social issues that have conventionally been framed narrowly across news and entertainment media. It demonstrated how entertainment television offers the possibility of broadening resources and encouraging deliberation, though assumptions about the role of entertainment television are reflected in audience scepticism about the appropriateness of using such programming as a basis for considering the social world. 

One key advance of the research is in its combination of theories not typically brought together: the entertainment-education strategy, and communication research into social and political representations on entertainment television. Examining the arguments across these areas starts to clarify shared objectives and assumptions, and suggests that political communication theory might learn from ideas and strategies employed typically in narrowly defined circumstances (developing countries and children's programming) to enhance our understanding of the possible role of entertainment television for audiences in media-saturated, developed countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This publications that resulted from the project contribute to an ongoing dialogue taking place among and between media researchers and media producers about the ways in which entertainment programming is classified, funded and valued.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>48758AFD-237F-4B73-B280-8241B1F385A1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9999637380.24201b2f12978</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>554AEFE6-22AA-424B-BB7A-97138F473D45</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entertaining ideas: social issues in entertainment television</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Media, Culture &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6df64a26fb7ea1a6d0497d394b4467c3"><gtr:id>6df64a26fb7ea1a6d0497d394b4467c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Klein B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa9fa94f0e49e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BA9A745B-EFC4-429C-BC98-842D56CA5090</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entertainment-education for the media-saturated: Audience perspectives on social issues in entertainment programming</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Cultural Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6df64a26fb7ea1a6d0497d394b4467c3"><gtr:id>6df64a26fb7ea1a6d0497d394b4467c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Klein B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfaafaa94b926a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3202</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G022925/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
