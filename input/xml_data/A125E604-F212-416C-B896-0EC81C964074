The leading molecule is presently made by an organism that is not ideal for large scale fermentation, and the compound structure may not yet be optimal in terms of pharmacological properties. We wish to identify the antibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster and re-engineer it for production in a heterologous expression host specifically engineered for production of actinobacterial natural products that is based on Streptomyces venezuelae. Pathway engineering in S. venezuelae will then be used to generate analogues of the lead antibiotic, which will be used to facilitate drug optimization and IP protection</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project would impact directly on the core business of Demuris by supporting and accelerating the development of its leading compounds through key value inflection points at a rate not currently achievable within the company's budget and resources. Demuris currently does not have dedicated scientists working on genetic manipulation of its antibiotic producer strains, let alone applying synthetic biology methods. The funding will allow Demuris to build capacity and expertise in an area that could profoundly enhance its competitive position. Although Demuris is making rapid progress, full exploitation of the opportunities for commercialisation of the Demuris actinomycete collections will require a significant VC funding round. Additional R&amp;amp;D Grant support would be a key signal for investors that the project is viable and that Demuris and its employees have the relevant skills and experience to succeed. Further investment in drug discovery at Demuris would generate high quality jobs and facilitate wealth creation in the North East of England, an area of high unemployment and economic deprivation. There are clear social and economic benefits of developing new antibiotics, by reducing length of time in hospital and mortality. Increased productivity and life expectancy will add value to the UK economy. Funding from TSB for this project will also enable JIC to fulfil its institutional commitment to Knowledge Exchange and Commercialisation, mandated by BBSRC, allowing it to transfer its knowledge and technical expertise in the genetic manipulation of streptomycetes into an industrial setting, and assist, in a tangible way, the development of a UK-based SME, Demuris.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171794</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project was based on the development and use by a US biotech company of a Streptomyces venezuelae derivative as a host for the expression of heterologous gene clusters for natural product biosynthesis. This strain has a number of innate characteristics that make it particularly attractive for this purpose. However, despite its utility, this industrially developed strain is not publicly available, and hence we set out to repeat and then improve upon the previous strain development to yield an expression host available for academics and other companies. However, it became apparent during our work that there was a step in the previous strain improvement programme that was key for the successful development of the expression host and that we were not aware of. Extensive attempts to repeat this crucial step, once identified, have failed to overcome an unexpected (but academically intriguing) block to the expression of heterologous biosynthetic gene clusters. Interestingly, we have been able to identify unexpected mutations that activate the expression of a test gene cluster, but these are specific to that cluster. Nevertheless, we are in the process of writing this work up for publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It might lead to a more extensive effort to overcome the block to heterologous (and potentially native) gene expression. If successful, the identification (and removal) of this block would not only result in a useful expression strain, but should lead to further interesting academic studies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A02F2E47-F007-4EE5-AB29-F0CE9A1618F8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545165e5d42de8.00305093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L004348/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>18D298A9-FFE3-432F-B077-E3B703272E29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemical engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19C5179C-0522-47E8-82DA-48583B56264E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
