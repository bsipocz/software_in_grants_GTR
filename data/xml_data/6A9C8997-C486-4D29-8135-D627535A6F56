But how do scientists know what is happening at a molecular or atomic level? Diffraction techniques can give us directly information such as the geometry that a molecule adopts, whether that geometry changes depending on the physical state of the substance, and what products are yielded when two or more molecules react. In the 20th century no fewer than 22 Nobel Prizes were awarded for work based around structural studies using X-ray and electron diffraction, leading to such important discoveries as the double-helix structure of DNA and the role of haemoglobin in the life cycle. In the 21st century the new goal is to understand the dynamics of chemical reactions. This requires us not just to observe structures before and after reactions have occurred, but also to gain a deeper knowledge of how and why reactions proceed in particular ways and, ultimately, to use this information to control reactions.The use of pump-probe experiments to study ultrafast events in chemistry, biology and materials science has already begun to revolutionise our understanding of chemical reactions. Such experiments use an intense laser beam to provide energy to molecules (the pumping), changing their fundamental structures, which are then observed (probed). Until now the emphasis has been on using lasers for both the pump and probe phases or, more recently, using X-ray diffraction to probe the structures. Diffraction methods yield transient structures of molecules directly, which is greatly preferable to inferring structural information from spectroscopy.My research takes this one step further and uses electron diffraction as a probe to study the structures of chemical species undergoing changes that occur on a variety of timescales. Electrons are particularly well suited to studying structures in the gas phase, where the lack of influence from neighbouring molecules (an issue with solid-state techniques) allows model systems to be studied. Electrons are efficient probes of molecular structure, with a high scattering cross section and a low proportion of inelastic scattering (which contains little or no structural information). Because electrons are charged they repel one another. This has consequences when very short pulses of electrons are required, and the theoretical limit of temporal resolution in a laboratory is 0.5 picoseconds. Experiments have been performed elsewhere and reported as femtosecond electron diffraction - this is misleading as the technology dictates that the picosecond limit remains. However, it is possible to break through this barrier using electrons with very high energies. Such electrons are routinely used in accelerator physics, where they are sped up until X-rays are emitted. I will ultimately harness these electrons to give pulses with a length of around 100 femtoseconds; when used in a diffraction experiment these electrons will allow the formation and breaking of chemical bonds to be observed.One area where I will use ultrafast electron-diffraction methods is in the study of hydrogen bonds, which are of utmost importance in chemistry and biology and are common in many molecular species such as water, DNA and proteins. Despite many years of work into the mechanisms of the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds there are still many unanswered questions. A process related to hydrogen bonding, called fast proton transport, is believed to occur in many biological systems where energy is converted from one form to another. It has been proposed that, in systems with more than one hydrogen bond, fast proton transport follows set patterns. I will also work closely with synthetic chemists to ensure that I am studying the systems that really matter to chemists today, setting my work apart from others who are currently practicising ultrafast electron diffraction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will benefit a number of groups of people both directly and indirectly, with the most immediate beneficiaries being the synthetic chemists, with whom I collaborate. They will gain from the in-depth understanding of structures and therefor functionality in their fields of interest, which in turn will allow them to make advances, including synthesising more efficient chemical vapour deposition materials and designing better catalysts. My research will open a new window on the ability to see inside molecular species. Understanding far more than we do currently about the mechanics of structural transformations during chemical reactions will also benefit other researchers in chemistry, who will be able to use the new insights offered by the work of me and my group to investigate new areas of interest. More indirectly, there are many chemists and other scientists who make use of chemical data and this work will add to the body of knowledge in an area (time-resolved gas-phase structures) that is cronically underrespresented. Similarly the data yielded by this research will greatly aid computational chemists in gauging the accuracy of new and existing computational codes. Other practitioners of electron diffraction will benefit from the methodological and apparatus development that will come from this work. For instance, many lessons learnt from this research will feed directly into plans to build a machine capable of producing MeV electrons at Harwell. All of the output mentioned above can also help the UK economy. Great science breeds wealth and any technological advances, such as those proposed, that can add value to the chemical synthesis output of the UK's universities and industrial sectors will help create jobs and income. Perhaps a more abstract group of beneficiaries are those who will work on this project. First, the impact on me as the PI should not be overlooked. This project will allow me to develop the instrumentation that will see me through the first half of my academic career. After 15 years, when the apparatus will have been superseded by further developments, there will be many aspects of this proposed work that will be carried forward to a new generation of diffraction research. In particular I foresee the work on deconvoluting and refining time-resolved data as being beneficial throughout my career. For the PDRA and the PG student their participation in this project will expose them to expert training in the use of lasers and application of computational techniques, as well as practical skills in electron diffraction, and sample handling. Having such broad skills will allow them to further their own careers. Communication is the key to ensuring that all synthetic chemists who might benefit from this research can take full advantage of it. I will be attending meetings around the UK, giving oral presentations and talking to people to educate them about the advances that are being made in the field of electron-diffraction research. This will maintain the supply of samples to be studied and ensure that new collaborators are intoduced to these methods. Of course, I already have a sizable pool of collaborators who are spread throughout the UK and elsewhere in the world. When I give colloquia around the country I will use this as another opportunity to meet the chemistry community at large. My memberships of the Dalton and main-group chemistry divisions of the RSC, and of the British Crystallographic Association will prove useful in expanding my networks. As one of the primary uses of electron-diffraction data is to enhance the accuracy of computational methods I will also be strengthening my links with this community. Through my attendance at National Service for Computational Chemistry Software meetings I already have contacts, but I will look to join the UK Computational Chemistry Working Party as a means of fostering further links.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>310623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant has been used to develop a novel time-resolved electron diffraction apparatus, as well as to overhaul an existing continuous electron beam apparatus.
