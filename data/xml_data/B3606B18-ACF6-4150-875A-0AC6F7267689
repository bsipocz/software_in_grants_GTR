&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How are mobility and quality of life understood within eastern and western migrants? everyday lives and with what consequences for the ways in which they make sense of themselves and their relationships with others?&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>increase the effectiveness of services and public policy (in UK, China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>enhance UK economic competitiveness by encouraging effective help for, and mobilising resources of, British abroad&lt;/li>

There is a growing interest among academic researchers and migration experts in drawing attention to the fact of British emigration as a counter to the sometimes unhealthy and unhelpful negative focus on immigration to the UK. This project has contributed world-class, social science research to that endeavour. One way in which this is being taken forward is through our future contribution to the British Museum Migration Project: http://www.migrationmuseum.org where we will contribute material, stories and photographs about British emigration. 

We have produced two glossy newsletters reporting on the project in non-academic language. These have been sent to The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office; British Council, Malaysia; The Expat Group, Malaysia; International Women's Association, Malaysia; Dato' Dr. Sir Peter Mooney, Malaysia; Karen Song , Vice Consul, British High Commission, Malaysia ; Robert H. Hawkins MBE, Honorary British Consul for Penang and Langkawi; Institute for Public Policy Research; Association of British Women in Malaysia; The Chairperson, Ireland Malaysia Association; Hong Kong University; and diverse expatriate groups, local charities and other government and non government organisations in Malaysia and Thailand.

We have been working with the British Society for Population Studies to raise the profile of British abroad. We gave a paper at the British Society for Population Studies Emigration Day, LSE, London, 16 May 2013, which was attended by representatives from Central Government Departments (DWP, DoH, Home Office), Universities, and local authorities. Paper: O'Reilly, K. and M. Benson. Invited paper. 'Emigration. The view from ethnography'

Lifestyle Migration involves relatively affluent people moving either part-&amp;not; or full-&amp;not;time, permanently or temporarily, to places that they believe will offer them a better quality of life. There is usually an economic incentive to their mobility, but the search for the good life is paramount in their motivations. 
One research method used in this project was an online survey targeted at British people living in Malaysia or Thailand who consider that they live there at least partly for quality of life reasons. 112 people responded, of which 57 live in Thailand and 54 in Malaysia. We found that mobility was a key feature of our respondents' lives. Prior to moving to Malaysia or Thailand respondents had lived in a variety of countries, spending on average 15.5 years living abroad. The most frequently cited reasons for moving to Malaysia or Thailand were: the lifestyle and standard of living (&amp;quot;simple life away from the rat race&amp;quot;); the food; the culture; geographical features (&amp;quot;stunning natural environment&amp;quot;); the weather; the friendliness of the people (&amp;quot;people are more friendly and open than in the UK&amp;quot;); for work or partner's work; having family or friendship connections in the country; an air of challenge or adventure (&amp;quot;the challenge of something new&amp;quot;) .
We also undertook 65 in-depth interviews with Westerners living in Thailand and Malaysia (note, the Eastern migrants were studied by the Hong Kong team). Respondents to our survey and interviews told us they value quality of life, but this is not measured in financial terms or in possession of goods, rather it is a slow pace of life, maintaining a good work/life balance, and health and happiness. 
The lifestyle of these migrants is cosmopolitan: our respondents spend time with people of 40 different nationalities, covering all continents. Almost half of the respondents felt they were at least a little integrated and 1 in 5 felt they were highly integrated in the local culture. Many interviewees also illustrated an interest in the local people, environment, and political situation, and several try to 'give something back' to the local community.
The study included periods of participant observation and analysis of digital communication. When it comes to contacting family and friends who do not live in Malaysia or Thailand, email and VOIP (such as Skype) are the preferred means for regular contact. Respondents telephone friends and family less frequently, and few write letters home. Visiting those living elsewhere is at best an occasional event; receiving visits is also not frequent. 
More broadly,the study raised issues around health and social security in older age; unexpected side effects of the ways in which migration is governed; long-term effects of colonialism; a challenge to the stereotyping of elite migrants; social commitment and community for expatriates; and what it means to be cosmopolitan. These areas are all in the process of being examined for future publication in peer-reviewed academic journals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have produced two newsletters summarising our findings for a non-academic audience and these have been distributed to diverse end-users, including the Foreign and Commonwealth office, various expat organisations and consulates in destination countries, and other interest groups such as Institute for Public Policy Research. They are also freely available via our web site: www.lifestylemigration.wordpress.com

We plan to hold an end-of-project public seminar in Hong Kong in collaboration with the Hong Kong University Knowledge Exchange Office to present our findings to academics in the field, key stakeholders (e.g. British Council; British, Malaysian and Thai consulates in HK), and tourism authorities and community organisations concerned with migration, responsible tourism and residential development in Asia.

The project was informed by strong structuration theory and employed virtual and visual ethnographic methods and life history interviews with migrant men and women. The research aimed to: increase the effectiveness of services and public policy (in UK, China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia); enhance UK economic competitiveness by encouraging effective help for, and mobilising resources of, British abroad; enhance quality of life through improved health and social welfare; to enhance mutual understanding in lifestyle destinations. The survey was 'live' through April to November 2012, and obtained 112 responses (57 from Malaysia, 54 from Thailand, and one who did not specify where he lived). Using the survey we were able to gather interesting demographic information. We also asked about migration histories, social lives, social networks and uses of technology for maintaining social ties, personal values and goals, and relationships with other ethnic groups. We understand this survey as contributing to the task of immersing oneself in the context - a key principle of ethnographic work. The fieldwork in Malaysia and Thailand took place between July and November 2012 during which time we undertook a total of 65 recorded interviews (Malaysia: 31; Thailand: 34). We used a variety of interview methods, including face-to-face, email, skype and telephone interviewing. Most of the interviews were conducted with British lifestyle migrants in Penang, Malaysia and in Hua Hin, Thailand. The rest were conducted through digital channels with respondents in other parts of Thailand and Malaysia. These included 'expert' interviews with consular staff and migration intermediaries, such as property developers and 'expat' magazine publishers. Not all interviews are archivable. Many other interviews were also undertaken within participant observation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F86B64A-F5E5-4881-9552-ECA0E5093331</gtr:id><gtr:impact>?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54acfe3d22ec07.86243504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Lifestyle Migration in East Asia</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/cgi/users/home?screen=EPrint::Summary&amp;eprintid=851378</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>058CDB95-B129-4398-BEDA-13D8DD643D64</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research Project: Lifestyle Migration in East Asia.
