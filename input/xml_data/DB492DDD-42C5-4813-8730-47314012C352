From a clinical perspective, changes in the relative contribution of brain areas (plasticity) or their interactions (effective connectivity) underpin the early stages of a number of developmental (e.g Dyslexia) and psychiatric (e.g. depression, psychosis), but most prominently neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's or Parkinson's) conditions. Due to plasticity, changes in effective connectivity may precede any changes in brain structure or in observed behaviour. Early detection and monitoring of such changes by means of non-invasive imaging techniques like EEG (or MEG) is vital if early intervention and early rehabilitation strategies were to be successful . Most current analyses of effective connectivity (EC) assume that the architecture and connection strengths of the functional network are static in time, or differ between task conditions at known time points. Thus, current approaches cannot be used to detect dynamic changes in network organisation at arbitrary time points or in the absence of a cognitive task, such as during on-going EEG monitoring and diagnosis of the above neurological conditions. I propose to develop a novel model and a toolbox for estimating the time-dependent effective connectivity of the dynamical brain network underlying the on-going EEG, and to test its accuracy and limits in detecting changes in effective brain connectivity induced by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Prior anatomical connectivity information and probabilistic atlases, derived from Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMRI), will be used to inform the model about the likely architecture of the functional network and about the likely anatomical location of sources, respectively. The goal is to provide a low-cost and fast application to detect, track and predict early changes in brain causal networks and their dynamics from the on-going EEG. Given the current emphasis on reducing the social and economic impact of neurodegeneration as highlighted by the Prime Minister's dementia challenge, the specific focus here is on using TMS to induce small changes in two exemplars of distributed networks that simulate semantic and motor neurodegeneration as a demonstration of what this method can detect. The proposed model has the potential to change strategies for screening and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions. It opens the possibility for developing new clinical applications that impact on the study of the aging brain and mental health, as well as the analysis of a wide variety of brain activity including normal during decision-making, resting-state and social behaviour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This fellowship develops a new mathematical method for the analysis of brain function that will allow neuroscientists to study the dynamics of brain state transitions during spontaneous (not evoked by experimental tasks) brain activity, which are inaccessible using conventional techniques. The project transfers stochastic dynamical systems methods and models that have been successful in the study of non-biological complex systems, to the study of the living brain. Under very general assumptions, such dynamical models can respond in a way that resembles brain behaviour in a wide variety of situations, which will provide valuable insights into the brain mechanisms underlying normal as well as abnormal behaviour. The most immediate impact is expected through uptake of the developed method by researchers in clinical and cognitive Neuroscience and engineers/neuroimagers/modellers working on the development of clinical applications. The fellow will advance this uptake through direct collaboration with leading Neuroscientists (Lambon-Ralph) and Neuroimagers/modellers (Parker, Cootes, El-Deredy) at the host institution (University of Manchester) and will explore the potential for collaboration with other groups (attendance to conferences and workshops targeting different impact groups are planned). 

Two main directions in which the proposed research will find its way into applications are currently on the horizon.

(1) Clinical and cognitive Neuroscience investigates underlying mechanisms and new treatments for developmental (e.g Dyslexia) and psychiatric (e.g. depression, psychosis), but most prominently neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's or Parkinson's) conditions. In most of these conditions, the interesting data are recorded during spontaneous (non-task related) brain activity. Therefore, the development of a tool for the non-invasive detection and monitoring of brain state transitions, that allow differentiating normal from abnormal brain function in the absence of an experimental task is vital if early intervention and early rehabilitation strategies were to be successful. Furthermore decoupling experimental design from the analysis method extends the range of feasible laboratory testing conditions. 

(2) By using spontaneous EEG (and potentially other non-invasive Neuroimaging techniques with a time component) to infer brain network dynamics, the proposed method provides a new way to make feedback control non-invasive (that is, applying control without changing the natural behaviour). The proposed method then provides a new avenue for interaction with the neural system without disturbing its natural state. In doing so, it also opens a range of possibilities for the development of biomedical applications based on non-invasive control, such as Neuro-feedback and Brain Computer Interfaces. Furthermore, with the recent development of low-cost portable EEG devices, the proposed method can also allow for the provision of personalised therapeutic treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Valparaiso</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the University of Valparaiso</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F93A097-A948-400C-A4A3-8B7CFA828FA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multi-disciplinary collaboration including disciplines such as Biomedical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Psychology, Neuroscience and Biology.

The purpose of the event was to create awareness in the general public about the wonders of the brain: how it works, how it is studied, what can go wrong in our brains, and how this might be fixed. It was a unique opportunity for the general public to interact with scientists, clinicians, creative practitioners and artists at a unique event with exciting and thought-provoking exhibits, displays and hands-on activities for all ages. The audience was very different from the usual museum events, and people often seemed to come in without intention and got taken by surprise and responded with great enthusiasm.
I led one of the stands called &amp;quot;Brain waves&amp;quot;, where people of all ages had the opportunity to engage in different interactive games. For example, they could use their brain activity to control the movement of a ball in the air, or to make the hologram of a space ship to levitate, by simply using a small cap fitted to their head. These games sparked millions of questions from the visitors including very small children, which allowed us to engange with them and explain in simple words the origin of brain signals and the basic of cutting edge technologies such as Brain Computer Interfaces, which use the same principles as the games shown. This also allowed us to initiate young minds into the fields of mathematics and physics as key sciences to understand and investigate the brain processes that generate brain signals.

Impacts and outcomes:
All the feedback we received through the various channels was full of praise (http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/brain-box-event-wows-manchester) and we were unanimously given best marks for the event (https://storify.com/samillingworth/brain-box). It was amazing to learn also that the visitor number of more than 5400 on a single day made the Brain Box one of the largest outreach events in the UK. Furthermore, we can report that the wired brain sculpture (https://mcrbrainbox.wordpress.com/arts/#2) that was built by the visitors during the event, was accepted to go on permanent exhibition in The University of Manchester's AV Hill neuroscience building, as a great piece of legacy reminding of the enormous effort we all put in and illustrating the close collaboration with the public which the Brain Box represented.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98e7ab4c7b8.09782881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://mcrbrainbox.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Neuroimaging Seminar Series at University of Manchester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7439877-769F-4499-86BE-98DD870E2F7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a recurring activity that is organised at the University of Manchester, where I and other members of the team present regularly. It consists of a series of open weekly seminars on Neuroimaging where postgraduate students and research staff have the oportunity to engage in discussing ongoing research in the area of Neuroimaging in general and in their own research projects in particular. The intended purpose is to create awareness among postgraduate students as well as among staff accross the University about current advances in Neuroimaging techniques, methods and modelling carried out in Manchester, as well as to incentivate cross-faculty multidisciplinary collaborations on subjects of common interest.
Due to the success of these seminars, the University of Manchester has agreed to provide further funding to widen the reach of the meetings so that we can now invite external internationally recognaised leaders in the field to participate and deliver keynote lectures on hot research topics of interest. This initiative has the intention to increase our collaboration network accross UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c030ed0307e4.45413099</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Latin American Summer School on Computational Neuroscience (LACONEU 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DFF38D42-DAC5-4273-8DF2-C1B681FD07BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This activity was a three weeks summer school in Computational Neuroscience, where I and another member of our team (Wael El-Deredy) participated as invited professors and co-organisers in order to deliver a series of lectures on basic topics of Computational Neuroscience and on specific topics of the current research of our team. The School attracted postgraduate students and young researchers from several Latin American as well as European countries. The purpose was to initiate the students in the exciting field of Computational Neuroscience through their introduction to cutting edge mathematical and computational science tools and its applications in Biomedical Research and Clinical Application, as well as introducing the students to some of the current challenges in this area.
The feedback from both the students and the local organisers was fantastic. Except for few exceptions, the students attending the school had a main background in mathematics, engineering and physics with very little knowledge or experience in biosciences. However, by the end of the school most students reported a change in view and declared their intention to pursue their future research career doing interdisciplinary work on biomedicine and bioengineering problems, specifically in the research topics of our group. As a result, we have established a new research collaboration network between our group and the University of Valparaiso, where two students are currently being co-supervised to work on subjects directly related to our project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c02e825045e4.97625689</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.laconeu.cl/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Meeting of the Psychonomic Society 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A48BC3E8-00B9-4F91-B2F3-4E3C14A20C14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We delivered two talks and one of the team members co-chaired the symposium &amp;quot;The effect of prior brain states on information processing&amp;quot;, during the International Meeting of the Psychonomic Society.
