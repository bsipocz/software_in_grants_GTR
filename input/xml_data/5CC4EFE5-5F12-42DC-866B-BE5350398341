challenges of this century. There are alternatives to oil, gas and nuclear such as 
water, wind and solar power. Of those, the latter is a virtually unlimited power source 
and we think that every effort should be undertaken to try to harvest the power 
of the sun. This is not an easy task because light energy needs to 
be converted into a form of energy that can be stored and supplied 
on demand. A convenient storage medium are molecules comprised of atoms
that are held together by energy-rich covalent bonds. Indeed, over millions of years 
nature has stored sun light in form of organic molecules (fossil fuels) via natural 
photosynthesis. A carbon-free alternative storage medium is molecular hydrogen with 
the added advantage that the energy density that can be stored with hydrogen 
is significantly larger than for fossil fuels. Thus, molecular hydrogen is envisaged as one of 
the primary energy carriers of the future. One of the grand challenges for scientists 
is to find or design a cheap catalyst that allows for efficient production of hydrogen from 
sunlight and a source for hydrogen atoms, ideally water. 

Clearly, one of the most sustainable approaches to hydrogen production is 
photocatalytic water oxidation, although this process requires efficient catalysts. 
Their design is by no means trivial and can probably be considered as the holy grail 
of contemporary material science. A viable alternative that we investigate here 
is to exploit biological molecules (hydrogenases) that can be found in microbes 
such as green algae and cyanobacteria capable of photosynthetic water splitting. 
Pilot plants of H2 producing organisms exist, but there are major barriers that must 
be overcome to bring the process to commercial viability. The most important one that 
needs to be addressed is the high sensitivity of the organism's hydrogenase to 
molecular oxygen. Evolved under anaerobic conditions, the biomolecule gets inhibited or 
damaged upon exposure of the oxygen that is around us in the atmosphere. 

There is evidence that hydrogenases may be modified so as to render the molecule 
less sensitive to oxygen. In order to facilitate this optimization process we propose
here to investigate theoretically the primary events of the oxidative damage, that is diffusion 
and binding of oxygen molecules to the active site of hydrogenases, by developing 
novel molecular simulation methods. The simulations will help to understand and 
interpret recent experimental measurements on a molecular level. For example, 
they will allow us to understand which pathways oxygen molecules take before they 
damage the active site and how fast this process occurs. The microscopic information 
gained from simulation will be vital for the suggestion of modifications (mutations) 
of hydrogenase that aim to restrict the access and the binding of molecular oxygen 
while leaving the catalytic power for hydrogen production unchanged. The effects 
of the suggested mutations will be predicted by our simulations and tested in vitro 
by an experimental colleague. 

The long term goal of this project is to obtain a hydrogenase mutant with 
significantly increased aerotolerance, which can be used for hydrogen production 
on a technological scale. This would have a tremendous socio-economic impact 
as the hydrogen industry is likely to take a prominent position on the 
future energy market.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of the research proposed will reach out to a diverse range of people and
communities including

- academics interested in fundamental and applied bioenergy research detailed in the section
 'Academic Beneficiaries'. 

- Users of the popular Gromacs computer simulation program, benefitting from code development 
 as proposed in the computational programme.

- Start-up or spin-off companies in the emerging area of biohydrogen production 

- Those in the alternative energy sector with interests in exploiting microbes or hydrogenase 
 in biofuel cell designs 

These beneficiaries will be alerted to our findings by their timely presentation at conferences, in publications and through press-releases timed to coincide with the publication of our research in leading journals. They will also gain from access to the computational and biological resources generated during the project. We anticipate that this impact will begin to be realised from month 18 of the proposed programme of research through the activities of all of the research team. To highlight our research and its potential impact to these groups we will invite representatives to a 
workshop on this topic in the second half of the grant period. This conference will bring together eminent 
speakers from academia and industry selected for their leading, international reputation in the area.

The work proposed will also shape the personal development of the two PDRAs. They will gain skills in 
advancing computational methods and electronic structure theory under the guidance of the PIs. In addition, 
the synergistic nature of the research programme and regular meetings of the research team will ensure that the PDRAs gain an understanding of the complementary approaches being used. This together with the multi-site nature of the project will ensure the PDRAs improve their skills in working collaboratively, and communicating effectively within and across sites. They will gain experience of project management under the guidance of the PIs who will also mentor their skills in oral, written and web-based communication of their findings. These impacts will begin at the outset of the project and continue to its completion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171251</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Marseille</gtr:department><gtr:description>Combining experimental and theoretical methods to learn about the reactivity of gas-processing metalloenzymes</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F2D249D-DE7B-4149-B597-6733AAC1B46B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>[1] P.

these novel approaches will be taken up not only by academic resarchers but also by industrial researchers in the future. The project has resulted in 7 peer-reviewed publications, four of which in the top chemistry journals (Nature Chemistry 2x, Angewandte and JACS).

(3) Following our computational investigation of O2 binding to Fe-Fe hydrogenase (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., vol. 53, pp. 4081-4084, 2014. ), we have made suggestions for mutations of the enzyme that could reduce the binding affinity of O2. These suggestions were based on the observation obtained from calculations that, following O2 binding, an electron transfers from the catalytic H-cluster site to O2, forming a partially oxidized cubane and O2-. The aim was to counteract this electron transfer by placing positively charge residues close to the cubane cluster and negatively charged residues close to the O2 binding site. Following mutations were suggested to the group of Leger: Thr356Lys, Ile356Lys, Cys298Glu. Unfortunately, these mutations did either not yield a stable enzyme or did not show reduction in oxygen binding. 

(4) By combining electrochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations we uncovered the molecular mechanism of O2 diffusion within the FeFe hydrogenase enzyme and its reactions at the active site. We find that the partial reversibility of the reaction with O2 results from the four-electron reduction of O2 to water. The third electron/proton transfer step is the bottleneck for water production, competing with formation of a highly reactive OH radical and hydroxylated cysteine. The rapid delivery of electrons and protons to the active site is therefore crucial to prevent the accumulation of these aggressive species during prolonged O2 exposure. These findings should provide important new clues for the design of hydrogenase mutants with increased resistance to oxidative damage.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Two lines of investigation are worth pursuing in future work to reduce oxygen sensitivity of FeFe hydrogenases. 
The first is the screening of the effects of all possible substitutions at positions 169, 290 and 296 (Cr numbering) 
of using both electrochemistry and MD simulation, with the aim to restrict O2 access to the active site and slow

third ET/PT step of O2 reduction at the active site using electrochemistry and QM calculations, to eliminate likely 
bottlenecks for O2 reduction.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96252627-7ECD-4789-92EC-91C09B915881</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54639fa81c3653.78740502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C478EA4-C989-45CE-860D-BFB86C35C943</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identification of Mutational Hot Spots for Substrate Diffusion: Application to Myoglobin.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of chemical theory and computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72e2405398dbef978ee1490db05ae609"><gtr:id>72e2405398dbef978ee1490db05ae609</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Sancho D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1549-9618</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f982982b72afc3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>082A7CFC-B535-4230-9F5B-FA10210D6175</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mechanism of Odiffusion and reduction in FeFe hydrogenases.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/91a1a90da7a332f89628fc6eb48b8022"><gtr:id>91a1a90da7a332f89628fc6eb48b8022</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kubas A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1755-4330</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54637a169f0aa6.36529667</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>084E88E9-4BCC-498A-B450-FE30DE48958B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Computation of Rate Constants for Diffusion of Small Ligands to and from Buried Protein Active Sites.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in enzymology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68917ea0592b16d56083230912f6814a"><gtr:id>68917ea0592b16d56083230912f6814a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wang PH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0076-6879</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d4270d7cce62.11734553</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82DD3573-6434-4C2C-9D02-53D616262DD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aerobic damage to [FeFe]-hydrogenases: activation barriers for the chemical attachment of O2.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/91a1a90da7a332f89628fc6eb48b8022"><gtr:id>91a1a90da7a332f89628fc6eb48b8022</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kubas A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54636eb5b27202.40527617</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76F2AD5B-3164-44C7-858B-83ADD554075D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recent Advances in the Theory and Molecular Simulation of Biological Electron Transfer Reactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3bc5f8394cfce3a5d1513a8d7ec62c8c"><gtr:id>3bc5f8394cfce3a5d1513a8d7ec62c8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blumberger J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0009-2665</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d71be150210.29928653</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE659E3E-BA23-47BB-91EA-2626BD36EAC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electronic couplings for molecular charge transfer: benchmarking CDFT, FODFT and FODFTB against high-level ab initio calculations.
