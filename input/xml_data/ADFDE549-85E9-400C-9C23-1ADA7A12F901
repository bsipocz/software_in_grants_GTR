Engineers have shaped the sporting world, from tennis rackets to bicycles, football boots to pole vaults, the engineer has played a critical role pushing the boundaries of athletic performance and allowing mass participation. Engineers sit at the forefront of modern sport; ever searching for a technological advantage to increase performance, enhance enjoyment, or reduce the risk of injury. This activity is by no means free of criticism, and many people have strong views on the role of the sports engineer, and whether technology is improving sport at all.This public engagement project concerns the development of an interactive exhibition that will explore the role of science and engineering in sport. The exhibition, 'Beautiful Games' will be developed in partnership with Museums Sheffield and will open for a nine month period at the Western Park Museum in 2011. Beautiful Games will subsequently move to the V&amp;amp;A Museum of Childhood in 2012. The exhibition will explore the science and ethics of human enhancement technologies and will be designed to work on different levels of intellectual engagement for a mixed audience. The exhibition will use innovative methods to capture visitor feedback and to facilitate a dialog about future of technology in sport.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be of benefit to a number of different beneficiary groups. The different groups are listed below alongside a brief description of how they will benefit from the project. 1. The project will be of benefit to the exhibition visitors. Visitors will have a positive experience and will engage in a debate about the future of technology in sport. Visitors will gain a greater understanding of how science is relevant to their everyday lives and will hopefully feel empowered to learn more. The active nature of the exhibition also means that many people will undertake physical exercise during their visit, hopefully providing inspiration for activity and exercise. 2. The project will be of benefit to the future attitude towards science and engineering in the UK. As much as anything, the exhibition is about creating a positive experience where technology is seen as relevant, exciting and fun. The project will support the myriad of other programmes that are concerned with improving the attitudes of young people towards science. 3. The project will be of benefit to Museums Sheffield. It will strengthen their reputation for delivering quality exhibitions, draw in considerable audiences, including new audiences, and raise their national profile through a subsequent exhibition tour. The project will encourage Museums Sheffield to work on future public engagement projects in partnership with other University departments. 4. The project will be of benefit to the City of Sheffield. The Council is keen to see that Sheffield's title as the UK's first City of Sport is reflected with real activity on the ground. This project will be considered as an integral part of Sheffield's larger programme of Olympic inspired activity. The Council will use the project to further demonstrate how the city has become an internationally recognised centre for sport, a message that will ultimately lead to inward investment and economic growth. 5. The project will be of benefit to the Cultural Olympiad. The project will facilitate a high profile exhibition space for the work of visual artist Jason Minsky. This artwork will focus on the use of human enhancement technologies in sport and is part of the Cultural Olympiad programme. The project team will work hard to ensure that the needs of the different beneficiary groups are well served and that these impact goals are met. The partnership that has been established to deliver this project has considerable experience and expertise in this area and both parties will draw on their extensive networks to engage the different beneficiary groups as described above. The engagement method of developing an interactive exhibition is believed to be the most effective means of realising the potential impacts of this project. The exhibition model allows for large and diverse audiences to have a meaningful engagement with the scientific topic in question, and it can also create project sustainability. It is envisaged that the exhibition that will be created in this project will go on to tour a number of different venues, thereby reaching new audiences and creating more positive impacts. The exhibition can be updated and renovated between each opening period and has the potential for a long and sustainable life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82583</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Beautiful Games: an interactive exibtion on the science and engineering of sport</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C418EC00-2960-4995-9453-33B2DCA80657</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Beautiful Games&amp;quot; was developed and co-produced with Sheffield Museum's Trust to coincide with the lead up to the Olympic Games in London.
