By the end of the period, mechanisms had been created (such as parliaments), a legal framework established (such as Magna Carta), and concepts fashioned that defined the political discourse and the political practice of Europe well into the early modern period and beyond. It is with exploring how these norms, ideas and mechanisms emerged that the project is concerned. 
At its heart is the premise that the very act of claiming power also brought with it the means of limiting and curtailing that power. The history of high medieval kingship, it will be argued, is also the history of the roots and origins of the political structures, norms and practices of the modern West. The question of how power was to be used and exercised, and how it may or may not be restrained, is as relevant today as it was in the eleventh or twelfth century. 

Using a wide variety of sources - saints' lives, miracle collections, chronicles, charters, letters, but also seals and coins, book illustrations and architectural remains - and casting its net widely - from Hungary to Scotland, from Portugal to Norway - this will be the first attempt in almost a century to explore the development of so important an institution as kingship in so pivotal a period in the gestation of medieval Europe. Kingship will be explored not with reference predominantly to the Carolingians or the Anglo-Saxons, but how it arose during a period of rapid expansion, when many new kingdoms emerged, with numerous traditions, customs and beliefs of their own. Kingship will also be considered not as it was described in learned treatises, but how it was experienced by a ruler's literate subjects, by monks and clerics, members of the aristocracy and others. The project will, moreover, look beyond royal self-representation to explore how a ruler's subjects responded to, how they sought to define and channel the exercise of royal might, and will point to lively and wide-ranging debates about the nature of the power of kings. To see how such debates could influence the exercise of royal power, how contemporaries sought to enforce shared norms and ideals, will be the final aim of this project. It will, in short, describe kingship as it was, not how theoreticians thought it should have been.
The project follows the various stages of how kings were made - from the initial claiming of a royal title through to a king actually beginning to rule its kingdom. Along the way, we will discuss the development of elections, the rules of succession, the treatment of women and under-age kings. The project will consider both the theory and the practice of rulership, the ideas and norms by which monarchs were meant to be guided, and the tools and mechanisms at the disposal of rulers and ruled. 

Among the key questions discussed are: how were kingdoms created? How did one become king? Who decided whether a king was a just ruler or a tyrant? What were the values by which rulers were meant to abide? How did those change over time, and how did they differ between the various regions of medieval Europe? How were they expressed, and who took the lead in expressing them? How were kings controlled? Who did the controlling? What mechanisms were tried, and why were some more lasting than others? 

All of which raises questions relevant for current political debates as much as for our understanding of the medieval roots of modern liberties, of institutions and concepts like parliament, and the protection of the individual. The questions asked and the problems considered transcend the chronological focus of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's impact will be cultural and long-term. Its most visible and long-term contribution will be in teaching and education, and in laying the foundations for a wider public engagement with questions of political power. In light of recent proposals for a reform of the national history curriculum, for instance, with a greater emphasis on long-term historical developments, this project makes a significant contribution. The monograph will not, of course, feature on school reading-lists. However, in training teachers and making scholarly findings based on a broadly-based research platform, it will most certainly contribute to the wider cultural and social development of the United Kingdom (through the Magna Carta commemorations in 2015). 

Just as important will be the project's contribution to broader cultural and political debates. Three areas in particular stand out: legitimacy (of governmental power); functionality (of such authority in the context of whatever it was that constituted the community in which it functioned); and normative precepts (the imagination of how power works and how it is transferred into practice). Some of the pathways to impact relating to this project (about which more below), are also designed to instigate debates about basic principles of political organization, and to provide a larger public with a broader historical framework on which to draw in conducting these debates. It will only be possible to conduct informed debates about universal questions, once we can place them within a specific historical and social context. We can only understand what is specific about a twenty-first century experience once we grasp both how it relates to similar experiences in the past, and how it differs from them. An informed and educated debate about issues such as the limits and purpose of political power is, however, central to a properly functioning democratic process. As such, the project will make a significant contribution, provide a long-term perspective often lacking in policy debates, and thus contribute to an active and informed public engagement with basic questions of political organization. 

The project will seek to ensure impact by a number of means: chief among them two public lectures (to historical societies, for instance), publication in history magazines aimed at a larger public, and outreach events (like the proposed workshop). The book emerging from the project, while clearly a research-based monograph, is also aimed at a larger informed public of both academics and non-academics, and will be written accordingly (that it will also be published in both hard- and paperback will help reach that wider public). It also flows from and will feed into the applicant's teaching. Further initiatives, springing from, though not part of this project, will focus on the long-term significance of the themes discussed in it (especially a series of events on Magna Carta). The public media furthermore indicate that there is a considerable appetite for medieval studies (when presented in the broad dimensions of this project, and especially when linked to an event or person with whom there is a pre-existing affinity). Depending on the reception of the book and workshop, elements of the project will be pitched to TV, to build on this interest. Once the book has been completed, I will propose an series of events to the Royal Historical Society and the British Academy in preparation for the eight-hundredth anniversary of Magna Carta in 2015. They will not commemorate teh event, but bring to a larger audience new perspectives and approaches, based on results from this project. The project thus meets a clear need, a curiosity about the past that extends well beyond academe. Its impact will ultimately consist in meeting that interest, in using the opportunity to make cutting edge research accessible to a larger public, to contribute and help frame public debates about political power and authority.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34463</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Becoming king: the culture of kingship in medieval Europe</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FD52CDB5-9986-4A83-82C8-A34D2F9E4A3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture, Historical Association, Cardiff
