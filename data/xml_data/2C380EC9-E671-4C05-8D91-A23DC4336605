These cells are responsible for secreting antibodies against the pathogen, in our case against Plasmodium falciparum. By quantifying malaria specific memory B cells in a range of different age groups, we hope to answer the question whether the severe clinical malaria episodes experienced by young children is due to the absence of these cells. |Our results (in press) have shown that the amount of malaria-specific memory B cells are the same regardless of the age group, however, the number of individuals having these cells increases with age.|</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Monitoring the kinetics &amp;amp; development of malaria specific memory B cells in malaria exposed individuals |Maintaining immunological memory to Plasmodium falciparum infections is essential, as it remains the only natural form of protection in malaria endemic areas. The beneficial role of malaria specific antibodies has long been established &amp;amp; is involved notably in, inhibiting parasite replication, parasite invasion &amp;amp; the sequestration of the parasite, thereby reducing pathology in the host. However, the half-life of anti-malarial antibodies is short, compared to protective immune responses to other pathogens, suggesting that immunological memory to malaria may be short lived.|Until now, technical resources were inadequate to quantify malaria antigen specific memory B cells accurately. However, recent improvements to techniques, such as B cell ELISpots, allow us to address this question. In this scope, an age-stratified cross-sectional survey was carried out in Brefet, Foni District, in May 2009 (SCC 1158) to quantify malaria specific memory B cells in individuals exposed to malaria. Preliminary findings suggest that detectable amounts of malaria specific memory B cells are the same for all age groups, however the percentage of responders increases with age. We hypothesize that younger children are less able to mount a durable memory response to malaria than older children, &amp;amp; speculate that younger children produce predominantly short-lived plasma cells in response to malaria, whereas older children are able to mount a response dominated by long-lived plasma cells.|We therefore would like to monitor the frequency &amp;amp; kinetics of malaria specific memory B cells after a known confirmed infection using B cell ELISpots. Therefore, we propose to recruit a cohort of children from patients who are enrolled in the ongoing case control study comparing severe cases with uncomplicated cases (SCC 1077, SCC 1143) during the 2009 transmission season, &amp;amp; to follow them up for 6 months. After consent has been obtained &amp;amp; in line with the Ethics Committee guidelines, a volume of blood approved for the respective age groups will be requested from study participants at day 0, day 7, day 28, day 56 &amp;amp; every two months thereafter until summer 2010.||Quantifying malaria specific memory B cells in individuals exposed to malaria|Maintaining immunological memory to Plasmodium falciparum infections is essential, as it remains the only natural form of protection in malaria endemic areas.

During the transmission season, participants were followed up for clinical episodes of malaria, &amp;amp; at the end of the transmission season participants were screened for evidence of recent malaria exposure. Patients with evidence of recent malaria exposure were asked to donate a second blood sample alongside a similar number of age-matched controls, selected from participants who did not suffer from malaria during the observation period.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>676868</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>22589</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>MRC PhD Studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2011-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>85BD9148-8A86-4FDF-9BBF-F543885D1765</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>PLpnf52LjUA0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1BAE1372-06F0-41BA-8DCE-B8AD3AED68A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Continued decline of malaria in The Gambia with implications for elimination.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8f0c436672f5d43f5d7799e36196b76b"><gtr:id>8f0c436672f5d43f5d7799e36196b76b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ceesay SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>mx64AfbFfVc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DD4E584-87B7-496D-B0DF-0948859CA20B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The breadth, but not the magnitude, of circulating memory B cell responses to P. falciparum increases with age/exposure in an area of low transmission.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cc96bd3ad806f00ea29e3bc4e5db2b91"><gtr:id>cc96bd3ad806f00ea29e3bc4e5db2b91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nogaro SI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>CbxLRLTB9RJ</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190097907</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
