Cytolytic proteins and peptide toxins are critical virulence factors of bacterial pathogens and play a major role in bacterial disease. Until very recently, human pathogenic fungi were not known to possess such toxins. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the causative agent of thrush, causes millions of infections annually in people worldwide. An explanation for precisely how this fungus is able to cause mucosal disease has remained at the forefront of medical mycology and immunology for several decades. We have recently identified a secreted peptide toxin (Candidalysin) as an essential factor required for C. albicans infection at mucosal surfaces. This is the first cytolytic peptide toxin to be discovered in any human pathogenic fungus. Our work has shown that Candidalysin interacts with the membrane of epithelial cells, causing membrane damage, inflammation and destruction of host tissues. Production of this toxin by C. albicans is now understood to be a critically important step that facilitates mucosal infection and disease progression. Importantly, we have now identified similar Candidalysin toxins in the related fungal species C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis, which are also pathogenic. Together with C. albicans, these fungi represent an immense health burden on the global population. The discovery of three Candidalysins identifies these toxins as a conserved family used by pathogenic Candida species to cause disease. Currently, there are no vaccines for Candida infections and the incidence of fungal pathogens acquiring resistance to commonly prescribed antifungal drugs is rising. Given their essential role in mucosal infection, understanding how this family of fungal toxins damage mucosal surfaces is critically important, and will pave the way towards therapeutic intervention that enables us to control and prevent disease progression. This proposal aims to identify exactly how Candidalysins interact with epithelial cell membranes to cause damage and infection. The findings of this work will be pivotal to our future understanding of fungal pathogenesis and will enable us to develop new strategies to engage with fungal infections to control their impact on the human population. This project will identify the Candidalysin family as new target, not only for the development of new antifungal drugs but also for the development of new vaccines, adjuvants, diagnostic tests and biomarkers for fungal infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The ability of microbes to cause damage to the human host is closely associated with infection and disease progression. We have recently identified a novel family of secreted peptide toxins instrumental to the pathogenicity of Candida albicans (C. albicans), C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis, three major life-threatening fungal pathogens of humans. This proposal will (i) define the mechanism of Candidalysin activity on epithelial cells and artificial membranes using a combination of biophysical, electrophysiological and phenotypic analyses, (ii) determine the influence of membrane phospholipids on Candidalysin activity using phospholipid arrays and quantifying the permeabilisation of artificial DOPC membranes containing different combinations of phospholipids, (iii) identify essential regions required for Candidalysin activity by comparing the activity of a panel of mutant Candidalysin toxins with their respective wild type controls, and (iv) define the contribution of Candidalysins and hyphal maintenance to epithelial activation in vitro and fungal pathogenesis in vivo using a series of C. albicans knock-in and Candidalysin-negative mutants. This project will provide essential new understanding to basic fungal biology and the mechanisms that underpin Candidalysin-induced epithelial damage. It will also identify Candidalysin as a new target for the development of new drugs, adjuvants, vaccines, diagnostic tests and biomarkers for fungal infections.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fungal infections continue to be major causes of death, suffering and economic loss and have serious impacts on the welfare of global communities. The impact of fungal infections on healthcare and economic expenditures is large and of growing concern. Candida species are the most common fungal pathogens of humans giving rise to severe morbidity in millions of individuals worldwide. Vaginal candidiasis affects ~75% of women during fertile age, equating to ~75 million infections/year. Furthermore, 50% of HIV+ patients suffer from oral candidiasis, equating to ~2 million cases/year. Candida infections are also the third most common hospital-acquired bloodstream infection and can thus be considered more medically-important than most bacterial infections including Enterococci and Pseudomonas spp. Systemic candidiasis usually results from translocation of Candida across the mucosae and is fatal (~40% mortality) equating to an estimated 200,000 deaths/year. Yearly healthcare costs in the USA for fungal infections are ~$3 billion, of which Candida infections account for $2 billion. EU healthcare costs are estimated to be similar. Therefore, Candida pathogens and C. albicans in particular (accounts for ~75% of Candida infections) carry an immense health burden and represent a serious socio-economic challenge for worldwide communities. Given this, identification of the fungal mechanisms that can be targeted to prevent or control disease is of high priority for global healthcare provision. As such, our landmark discovery of the Candidalysins represents a seminal advance in our understanding of fungal infection. A major long-term impact goal of this project is commercial exploitability of our data. The Candidalysins and the epithelial components this novel family of toxins interacts with can be targeted for the development of more effective preventative and antifungal treatments. For example, Candidalysin possesses unique properties that impart a dual role for exploitation, both as a target for intervention (due to its role as a virulence factor) and in activating innate antifungal defences. Furthermore, Candidalysin lacking the C-terminal KR motif may represent a novel class of mucosal adjuvant given its ability to activate epithelial cells and mucosal immunity without causing damage. In addition, the signalling circuits activated by Candidalysin interaction with epithelial cells can be exploited for immune-based strategies to combat fungal infections. The project will also impact on the diagnostics industry, since Candidalysin is the first fungal marker identified to date that enables the host to discriminate between commensal and pathogenic C. albicans. This could be exploited in new clinical diagnostic tests that would target Candidalysin as an identifiable 'risk factor' of pathogenesis and infection, and thus when antifungal treatment is warranted. Finally, the identification of the first cytolytic toxin family in Candida has opened the door for a new field of research in toxin discovery in medically important fungi, with broad implications for elucidating multiple pathogen infection mechanisms across the fungal kingdom. Also, given that Candidalysin may act similar to peptide toxins such as melittin (honey bee) and magainin 2 (African frog), this work may provide broader insights into the basic biology underpinning toxin activity in a range of different organisms. In summary, this project will have immediate impact on multiple academic fields but has significant potential in the longer term to impact on pharmaceutical and commercial industries with specific interests in developing new drugs, vaccines and adjuvants to prevent mucosal diseases and in designing new diagnostic tests and biomarkers for mucosal infections. This will have a substantial impact on clinical medicine and disease management, which will ultimately improve the economic competitiveness of the UK and improve human health and quality of life on a global scale.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>486768</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Aberdeen Fungal Group</gtr:department><gtr:description>Animal model</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B78855C-EBB5-4A08-855C-D8186C75E582</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dat required for publications</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>MNoPSWGJW3g-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Assessing Candida strains in an animal model</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Supplying Candida strains for study</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society Summer Exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8725B4F8-7AB0-4439-996F-7BE1DDDDDCF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>KILLER Fungus at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition
Introduction
The Wellcome Trust Strategic Award for Medical Mycology and Fungal Immunology (WTSA-MMFI) funds a major consortium of UK universities investigating human fungal disease, whose coordinating hub is at the University of Aberdeen. In July 2016, the WTSA-MMFI and partners presented an exhibit entitled 'Killer Fungus' at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition. The opportunity to exhibit the consortium's world-leading medical research at this highly prestigious Royal Society event - as well as to develop materials and games that will be available for wider use after the exhibition - was made possible by generous support from the WTSA-MMFI and other funders including the British Mycological Society, the British Society for Medical Mycology, The Microbiology Society, King's College London Dental Institute and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology.

The WTSA and fungal disease research at the University of Aberdeen and in the UK
The University of Aberdeen is at the forefront of medical research into fungal infections through the activities of the long-established and world-renowned Aberdeen Fungal Group (AFG). In partnership with Radboud University Nijmegen, Netherlands, the AFG secured a Wellcome Trust Strategic Award (WTSA) worth &amp;pound;5.1 million, to establish and lead the Medical Mycology and Fungal Immunology (MMFI) Consortium (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mmfi/). The Consortium also comprises research and training expertise from Imperial College London and the Universities of Birmingham, Exeter, Glasgow, Kent, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, King's College London, St George's University London and other UK institutions.

The WTSA Consortium used the critical mass of expertise across the UK sector to promote 4 major aims:
? To promote research excellence and new interdisciplinary scientific initiatives in medical mycology and fungal immunology.
? To integrate, expand and resource complementary skills in this field thereby increasing our understanding of fungal disease and translating our basic research into the clinic and the pharmaceutical industry.
? To establish a national consortium to coordinate a research and training programme that harnesses the excellent, but dispersed, expertise within the UK to understand and treat fungal infections and train a new generation of scientists.
? To promote the public understanding and profile of this often misrepresented and underappreciated area of science.
Fungi cause around one billion superficial infections per year, which can cause discomfort and pain. However, a few fungal species can cause serious life-threatening infections. Over 1.3 million people around the world die each year from these invasive infections, which is a higher death toll than from malaria and around the same as that from tuberculosis and HIV. Most of these life-threatening infections occur when the immune system is weakened or breached by trauma, for example in people with HIV, in hospital intensive care units, patients requiring stem cell or organ transplants or undergoing treatment for cancer or suffering from conditions such as cystic fibrosis.

In July 2016, the AFG was also awarded prestigious Medical Research Council Centre status for Medical Mycology (MRC CMM, http://www.abdn.ac.uk/cmm/). The Centre, whose activities will complement the work being pursued within the WTSA, aims to fulfil a strategic need to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of fungal disease. Major priorities include the need for simple and cheaper diagnostics, safer and more effective drugs and a better understanding of fungal virulence and host antifungal immunity. The MRC Centre is the first to be awarded in the field of Medical Mycology.
The Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition
The Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition is one of the UK's most prestigious science engagement events. The week-long exhibition, described as 'a free festival of visionary science and technology', was attended by more than 14,000 members of the public and school students this year. The event has a very high media profile, allowing an expanded audience to be reached through TV, print media and online. As such, the exhibition provides a superb opportunity to showcase research and innovation in an exciting and engaging manner.
The Killer Fungus exhibit was awarded a place at the exhibition through a highly competitive selection process and was one of just 22 exhibits chosen to represent UK cutting-edge science.

The Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/killerfungus16/) and Twitter account (https://twitter.com/killerfungus16/) were updated regularly with pictures, stories and news throughout the week.
Impact and feedback
The exhibit was extremely popular and succeeded in engaging many thousands of visitors over the course of the week. Visitor feedback was captured by a simple form and clearly demonstrated the value of the exhibition; the percentage of people who were extremely/very aware of the role of fungi in human disease increased from 17.8% before visiting the exhibition to 81% after visiting the exhibition.
Overall, the human mannequin and research videos were the most informative (89% and 88%, respectively), but the video games were the most fun (100%). For the exhibition as a whole, 73% of visitors found the activities extremely/very informative, and 78% found them extremely/very good fun.

? The games are also available to download for anyone to play from ITunes and GooglePlay.
Summary
The Royal Society Summer Exhibition is a prestigious annual science public engagement event in the UK, at which the Killer Fungus exhibit was able to have a significant impact in enhancing public awareness of research related to the diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections. The exhibition enabled almost all of the major centres of research in the UK engaged in this activity to work together to raise awareness of the field. The exhibition was a resounding success due to the outstanding team effort of all those involved in fungal research at Aberdeen and its partner universities. In presenting the exhibition more than fifty people were trained and participated in a major public engagement activity for the first time. Many of the resources created will and have been used in other public events, where it is hoped to continue to raise the profile of this lesser known area of human infectious disease. The exhibition led to a series of newspaper articles, press releases, radio interviews, blogs and articles in general magazines that have further increased awareness of medical mycology issues. It also led to invitations to exhibit at other events such as the Royal Society Satellite Summer Exhibition during Manchester Science Festival week in October 2016. The exhibition was only possible due to the generous time of many to stage the event and the financial support of allied professional societies and other funders to whom we are enormously grateful.
