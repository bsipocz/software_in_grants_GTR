a Digital Repository</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/I015647/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project will establish a digital repository of instruments used for research into second language learning and teaching (IRIS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The freely accessible repository will facilitate international collaboration, enhance the scrutiny of data collection tools, and increase the quantity and quality of replication studies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>IRIS will contain multi-media resources for a wide range of research areas, such as evaluating the effectiveness of instruction, investigating how learning develops at different stages and why, and documenting the contexts in which second languages are used and learned.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research instruments will include:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>visual stimuli used to get learners talking&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>questionnaires used to investigate motivation, identity, and attitudes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>audio and written stimuli used to investigate the speed and nature of learners? reactions to language&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>experimental teaching materials&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>observation protocols to document language use and instructional contexts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Users will be able to up- and down-load instruments, and search its contents across a range of parameters such as language being learnt, age and proficiency of participants, research area, instrument type, and publication details. The project will demonstrate uses of IRIS via workshops, an open call for replication studies, and a conference on eliciting language from learners. The repository will be held at the University of York.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198877</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Bilingualism: Language and Cognition</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Journals that support IRIS</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BD92772-3CEE-4E8A-AD1F-5BAF1D60DCB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism, Language Learning, Cognitive Linguistics have all inserted IRIS announcements or squibs in their journals.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462724c6a92a2.50855705-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All the journals mentioned above suggest to accepted authors that they upload their materials to IRIS either in the acceptance note to authors or in the Notes to Contributors on the journal website, and so they promote contributions to the resource.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>IRIS increases visibility of research, and so probably increases the downloads of journals articles.

8 university based researchers worked with them in thematic groups to discuss the research needed and plan and design small research projects for the teachers to carry out in their contexts.
89% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the workshop was useful, relevant, stimulated greater understanding.



16/18 teachers reported that they 'planned to use some of the ideas presented today in their work' 
16/18 reported that The workshop has made me more aware of research into foreign language teaching and learning in primary schools' 
16/18 reported that they 'plan to carry out a small scale research study based on the ideas discussed today'
6 of the 18 participants actually provided a report on the practitioner research they have carried out as a result of the workshop, giving them insight into their own contextualised problems. 
One teacher reported that they were doing a project looking at pupil motivation for learning foreign languages, and for their data collection materials commented: 'I will adapt ones I have already found on IRIS'
One participant noted that the IRIS website was the most useful aspect of the workshop.
The number of people impacted is estimated as 101-500 because each participant works with between 30-100 pupils/trainees.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545a086199daa3.37707051</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/media/educationalstudies/documents/staff-docs/Primary%20Foreign%20Languages%20Event%20Flyer.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Marsden, E., Kasprowicz, R.

The resource has had almost 16000 downloads, about 1/5 of which are from practising teachers and teacher educators, 3/5 from students, and a 1/5 from academics, including many early career researchers.

The engagement, collaborations and other outputs entered for this report give an indication of workshops, keynotes, posters and talks that have helped to promote the resource amongst teachers who are interested in research. It is used for research methods training for students, and also in workshops to engage teachers with research. 

IRIS has been cited by others (practitioners and academics) in many different forums: publications, presentations, magazines, practitioner publications, and links to IRIS have been established from several other sites. See Other Outputs and Knowledge/Future Steps.

The initial funding has also led to other projects to engage teachers with research (both doing it and consuming it). These are listed in the 'Further Funding' sections.

In addition, IRIS partially led to the successful award (as co-I) on an EPSRC award in the Digital Economy scheme. It has also been cited by several others independently in their applications for funding as a forum that will host their materials, as no other such forum exists.

Please see entries in Engagement Activities for examples of how IRIS has engaged with teachers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56DC06C8-074D-4418-83FD-F6ABD200B652</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fb2740fa906.03665435</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have established a unique resource for improving the quality, transparency and accessibility of research into language learning and teaching. The IRIS repository holds materials that have been tried and tested (i.e. used in peer-reviewed published work) to collect data for research. Such materials includes questionnaires, language tests, software scripts, observation schedules, pictures and sound files to elicit language, interview protocols, amongst many other tools and instruments. 

The resource is useful for many reasons. Data collection tools are extremely time consuming to create and require a high level of research training and expertise; the IRIS resource therefore maximises the potential of past investments made across the globe into language related research. It gives open access to research instruments, allowing others to use them and adapt them to their own needs. 

IRIS holds more than 2500 materials bunched into over 950 instruments (e.g. a listening test and its transcript would be one instrument). They cover a wide range of methods and theoretical approaches, represent the work of 350 researchers, are cited in 100s of references to individual publications. 

IRIS has had approximately 16000 downloads, about 1/5 of which are from practicing teachers and teacher educators, 3/5 from students, and a 1/5 from other academics, including many early career researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This resource is used in many different ways by different audiences. 

We seek usage data from those who leave their email address upon downloading. These indicate that the materials are being used to inform the design of future research, for research methods training, and helping researchers to understand past research more thoroughly. 

Teachers and teacher educators have used the resource to download examples of research materials to either use directly in their own research or to inform their thinking and understanding about their practice.

Journal editors direct their authors to IRIS to upload their data collection materials there. 

Total number of downloads: 15965
Hits on the IRIS site since January 2012: 30990
About 1/5 of the downloads are from teachers and teacher educators; 3/5 from students; and 1/5 from researchers.

As a recognised repository, IRIS enables journals (in partnership with the Centre) to award badges to authors who submit their data collection materials in IRIS, thus recognising open science research practice. The journals display these badges on the articles themselves. This in turn has benefits for a journal's ranking and fosters open science practice. 

To date, IRIS has impacted on the policy and practice of the journal Language Learning and is continuing to advocate this change to other journals that suppoort the repository.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c30bc0ec1a57.95465318</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9922/homepage/ForAuthors.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>IRIS - Instruments for Research Into Second Languages - is a freely accessible repository for materials that have been used to collect data for research in the area of second language learning and teaching (including foreign language teaching, second language acquisition, bilingualism, second language use and culture, second language teacher education). The materials include a wide range of methodological and theoretical perspectives, including data collection tools such as questionnaires, interview protocols, language tests, word lists, sound files, videos, classroom observation schedules. The materials are multimedia, including text, audio/visual files as well as URL links and software scripts. Materials can be downloaded and re-used or adapted, using creative commons licensing. 
Additional features of the repository include: i) Contributors and downloaders can leave comments on the materials, and users can 'request materials' if they cannot find what they were looking for. ii) In addition to the records which hold the actual materials, some 'metadata-only records' are also included, which provide details about the methods used.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7558B974-E622-4884-B426-EAF50A169B08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There have been over 5,500 downloads of materials from IRIS and over 15,500 visits to IRIS. 
30 major, top-rated journals in the field of second language research now promote IRIS by asking their authors to contribute to the resource. 
IRIS holds over 800 files, bundled into over 340 data collection tools.
