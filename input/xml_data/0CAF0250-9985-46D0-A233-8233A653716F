Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease. In 2012 there were 9.3 million new cases of active TB worldwide and over 9,000 in the UK. TB is transmitted by coughing from a patient with disease affecting the lungs. For those in contact with them, who themselves breath in the TB bacteria, 3 things might happen: their immune system may clear the infection completely; they may become unwell with TB (active TB); or the bacteria may enter the body and remain there 'dormant' - latent TB infection. Approximately one third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. Of these, approximately 1 in 10 will go on to develop active TB at some point in their life. Diagnosis and prophylactic treatment of latent TB can reduce an individual's risk of developing active disease in the future and is an important tool in reducing rates of TB both in the UK and elsewhere.

AIM
This project will examine two patient journeys: the first is their journey from migration to arrival in the UK and experience of TB screening; the second will explore illness pathways from initial symptoms of TB to health-seeking behaviours and healthcare encounters. The study will be set in east London, now the 'TB capital of Western Europe'. Barts Health NHS Trust is the largest TB service in the country and treats approximately 700 new cases of TB per annum.

TB SCREENING
To reduce the spread of infectious TB several strategies for TB screening exist in the UK. Some of these processes have recently changed. Screening when someone enters the country is being been phased out. A new system of pre-entry screening in a migrant's country of origin has been implemented. Some GPs screen patients when they register. However, most TB screening programmes target active TB which affects the lungs therefore missing the 50% of TB which affects other parts of the body and also missing latent TB infection. It is also unclear what proportion of patients who develop active TB in this country do not undergo screening because they fall outside these pathways. It is our impression that TB screening is not sufficiently well organised.

ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE
Many patients with undiagnosed active TB attend Emergency Departments rather than their GP. Some have been unwell for months. When people who have recently moved to this country do become unwell, they often struggle to access healthcare services. This can cause a delay in diagnosis, resulting in wider spread of disease, higher costs, greater illness and even death. 

METHODS
Participants for this study will be recruited from TB clinics. The research will be conducted by a doctor who has significant experience working within the local community and with TB patients. Patients will be asked for their written consent and information will be collected from a questionnaire and an interview. Patients will be asked to tell their stories from migration through to diagnosis without interruption. To ensure the specific issues surrounding TB screening and healthcare access are covered, a limited number of more direct semi-structured interview questions will be used to 'fill in the gaps' of the patient's narrative.

OUTCOMES
This project will provide detailed insight into the limitations of the current systems for TB screening and healthcare provision for migrants. Outcomes will include specific and detailed policy recommendations about how the organisation of these services could be more effective and accessible. The results will highlight key strategic areas which should be targeted with a view to reducing the disease burden of TB in the UK. The findings will also be applicable to migrant groups within other settings (and with other infectious diseases) and to TB screening in major urban centres within countries of low TB prevalence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In 2012, there were 8.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) worldwide and 1.3 million deaths with over 9000 cases of active TB in the UK, of which 75% were in patients born abroad. 

The Home Office, NICE and Public Health England all recommend targeted TB screening processes either pre-entry, at the border or in the community. Reports from patients suggests that these are not systematically implemented and are, at best, ad-hoc. Alongside this, new migrants who do develop active TB often struggle to access the UK healthcare system. This leads to delays in diagnosis and consequently higher risk of disease transmission, higher costs and avoidable morbidity and mortality.

This study will explore the experiences of TB patients who have recently migrated to the UK of TB screening and access to healthcare.

Methods: 
This is a mixed methods study. 100 sequentially recruited patients who have recently been diagnosed with TB and who have migrated to the UK within the last 3 years will be invited to complete a survey. From this group a maximum variety sample of up to 40 patients will be selected. Qualitative data will be collected from this group using audio-taped interviews. Similar interview techniques will also be used to collect data from up to 20 key professionals and community members.

Anticipated outcomes: 
This project will provide detailed insight into the limitations of the current systems for TB screening and healthcare provision for migrants. The results will highlight key strategic areas which should be targeted with a view to reducing the disease burden of TB in the UK. It is likely some of the findings will be applicable to migrant groups within other settings (and with other infectious diseases) and to TB screening in other major urban centres within countries of low TB prevalence.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Overview of potential beneficiaries:
The key beneficiaries of this study will be TB patients and migrant groups. This research aims to improve the health and wellbeing of a vulnerable population of patients and the surrounding community in which they live. The results will be used to direct future policy and improve NHS services. Ties with patient and public representatives have been forged in the development of this project and will continue to strengthen throughout this study. These relationships will increase the potential involvement of the public, migrants and TB patients in research and policy development for the future. This study will also benefit academia by contributing new knowledge to a variety of fields. It will strength the use of qualitative and mixed-methods research in healthcare and in particular in the field of tuberculosis and will also support the early career development of a potential future research leader.
Timescale
An impact should be expected within 5 years. It is possible that local communities, TB patient groups and migrant groups have already experienced some benefit from this project due to their early involvement exploring the study design and feasibility of the project. Benefits for these groups will increase and continue to strengthen throughout the project. Further, more measurable, benefits are likely to be felt between 3 and 5 years of this project when the outcomes can be translated into service improvement strategies. The academic community will start to see impacts 18 months into the study when preliminary findings will start to be reported.
Below I have summarised potential outcomes of this research and highlighted likely beneficiaries for each:
Evaluation of current TB screening practices.
- Policy makers including Public Health England and the Home Office will better understand how they can improve current processes.
Improve screening processes for latent TB infection with an aim to reduce TB incidence.
- Reduced risk of transmission benefitting the general public. 
- This will reduce the health and social inequalities which are associated with TB (this is one of key aims within the latest TB strategy produced by Public Health England).
Reduced diagnostic delay and improved access to healthcare.
- Reduction in the morbidity and mortality experienced by TB patients. 
- Earlier diagnosis results in fewer complications and reduced TB treatment costs. 
- Reduction in the risk of disease transmission which benefits the general public. 
- Migrant TB patients' experiences of healthcare access are likely to be relevant to other migrant groups and vulnerable or underserved populations. 
- Targeted, culturally specific data on where current processes succeed and where they fail will benefit both UK policy-makers in the UK and abroad.
Involvement of former TB patients to oversee the study as part of a project advisory committee.
- This is likely to encourage future participation in research which may further benefit TB patients. 
- Participation in this way may also empower patients to better share their experiences within their own communities; increasing awareness and reducing stigma.
Understanding the attitudes and perspectives of key professionals and community leaders in relation to TB screening and healthcare access.
- Better understanding of each other's experiences between the patients and the professional participants will promote the development of more robust services, sensitive to the needs of all parties.
To develop the research skills, with particular emphasis on qualitative methodology, of the research Fellow.
- This will benefit the research fellow herself and, in the longer term, patients, the general public and the academic community will also benefit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Opinion piece - effect on healthcare access &amp; public health risk of NHS passing data to home office.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68AC2B75-4A20-4256-8CCB-7B904D98606B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Buried in the recent constitutional uproar over the triggering of Article 50 and President Donald Trump's flurry of objectionable executive orders, was the news that the NHS has been passing on data to the Home Office so it can track down people who are living in the country illegally and deport them. 

This opinion piece highlighted that rather than being in the public's best interests, by introducing barriers to health care access for undocumented migrants, the government are actually putting the general public at risk. I directly relate this to the stories I am hearing from the participants in my research study who tell me they are afraid of accessing health care services for fear of being deported. These people have active tuberculosis and some of them had infectious disease. The longer tuberculosis goes untreated the greater the chance that it will spread in the community, the greater the risk to the individual of illness and even death.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589dd38ceb9fd8.36126718</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://theconversation.com/nhs-urged-to-share-data-so-patients-can-be-deported-72380</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
