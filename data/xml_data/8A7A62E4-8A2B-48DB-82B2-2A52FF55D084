Based on
Industry statistics, global Oil and Gas companies routinely incur downtime costs
estimated as GBP 812,000,000 caused by failed wellbore enlargement (underreaming).
Underreaming is essential to maximise production. This is especially true in high-cost
deepwater or ultra-deepwater wells which typically require 6 enlarged sections before
completion and exceed depths of 27,000 feet. In this way, underreamed hole size is integral
to well construction. Yet, it is inherently uncertain and costly in terms of unnaceptable
downtime.
If the Smart Reamer were proven downhole, a lucrative opportunity exists. The Smart
Reamer potentially offers oil companies the ability to reduce downtime and reduce
underreaming risk by measuring wellbore diameter in real-time ? a service that is unavailable
today.
Callipers, if used, are traditionally operated as separate measurement services and do not
provide real-time data. A typical Schlumberger statistic shows that 1 in 5 underreaming jobs
are likely to experience tool failure than non-underreaming. The Smart Reamer offers a novel
step-change in drilling by integrating the two separate and consecutive services and offering
simultaneous real-time wellbore condition monitoring.
Feedback from oil companies shows an average downtime saving of 24-48 hours rig-time
(GBP 500,000 per offshore job). If this can be achieved, this amounts to a potential saving of
over GBP 812,000,000 applied across all current drilling underreaming operations worldwide.
The proposed new Smart Reamer Drilling System, if it were proven as a prototype, would
accurately measure and provide a real-time view of the well bore allowing the drilling team to
:
-Pinpoint narrow wellbore sections caused by underreamer wear or changes in geological
strata
-Eliminate downtime related to deployment of casing in a narrow wellbore. A single failure of
this nature can cost GBP 3,000,000.
-Avoid costly retrieval of equipment, loss of equipment and in the worst case a re-drill or
sidetrack
-Accurately predict cement volumes to ensure sealing of casing
-Eliminate calliper deployment - minimum average saving of GBP 500,000/deepwater well
and GBP 62,500/onshore well.
Currently, underreaming and measurement are available as disparate and time consuming
components. Existing acoustic measurement technology is flawed insofar as downhole
changes cause erroneous readings. Our prototype will overcome these flaws by building on
the research and exploiting the patents to provide accurate measurements that allow for
variations in downhole drilling conditions.
The Smart Reamer is rapidly scalable, sustainable and has high growth and profitability
potential. The challenge is to develop the surface system into a certified downhole
technology. Hence, the technology adds value to the patents issued in 2010 and the patents
protect the technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>175521</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720002</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
