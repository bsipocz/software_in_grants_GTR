The project worked over 20 months with 60+ volunteer members of a working class community in Walukuba, Jinja, in eastern Uganda. It built an intergenerational, inter-ethnic, inter-religious, cross-gender community group of widely divergent educational attainment; that engaged in a sustained process of embodied arts-based action research and dialogic debate emerging from locally identified environmental concerns. The project led to both horizontal - community to community, and vertical - community to stake holders and policy makers - interventions and knowledge exchange events combining performance and debate. Marked gains in community cohesion, confidence, advocacy and activism were achieved (McQuaid &amp;amp; Plastow 2017; film 'We Are Walukuba' https://vimeo.com/171216540/e04de5b695). The group registered as a Community Based Organisation 'We Are Walukuba' in November 2015 in recognition of the transformative value participants ascribed to the project.

This proposal builds on the unforeseen achievements, beyond original research aims, of the group and our Frierean-inspired methodology (Friere, 1970) that invoked a virtuous circle of action (arts-based embodied exploration of of issues identified as concerning the community) and reflection (group discussion of critical reflections generated by activities undertaken), and appetite expressed by the community to continue to work together and build their skills to become more effective community advocates. In consultation with We Are Walukuba - henceforth WAW - it was agreed that what the group needed in order become self-sustaining in the longer term, and to complete the transformation into a group of self-confident independent advocates for their community, was targeted training by experts in a range of arts and organisational skills. The skills needed were discussed in a series of community meetings with WAW, Plastow and McQuaid in August 2016. It was agreed these would be delivered in 1-2 week blocks where workers could take time out of work and mothers could be provided with child care. Each group of 6-12 trainees would undertake to in turn pass on the skills acquired to the wider group. The impact of this first stage of the project will be evidenced by a series of community organised performative and knowledge exchange events utilising the skills acquired.

The second stage of the work is focused on scaling up the project; demonstrating how it provides a replicable model for arts-based, dialogic community empowerment, by reproducing its essential stages, learnt from the Uganda experience, over a four month period in an analogous working class community (Mtogolo village) in Zomba, Malawi. Building on the particular knowledges and contacts of our Malawian Researcher, Zindaba Chisiza, we will collaborate with a local HE partner- the Department of Performing Arts, University of Malawi, and a local arts-based NGO, YONECO. We will enable all three parties, working as equals, to mutually learn, both a new methodology for community engagement, and to share the knowledges and perspectives of all concerned about the community-selected broad topic under investigation. 

The final 3 months of the project will be given over to:
* co-production of a co-authored community book sharing the experiences of the project in both sites
* co-production of a manual in the form of a multi-media website, explaining the methodology of the project
* supporting Chancellor College in reviewing and reforming its arts for development curriculum in the light of the project
* supporting the NGO in reviewing and reforming its arts for development training and approach
* dissemination events in Uganda, Malawi and the UK
* evaluation of the impact of the work in both Malawi and Uganda and on all involved in the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit.
1. The primary beneficiaries will be the community groups and project partners We Are Walukuba in Uganda and Mtogolo Village in Malawi. In the first case we have worked closely with WAW for 20 months with the INTERSECTION project and designed this project in close collaboration with them in meetings held in Uganda in August 2016. Mtogolo village is an area of the town of Zomba, Malawi. They have discussed involvement with project researcher, Chisiza, and project supporter YONECO, and agreed on project objectives and timing.
2. The wider communities of Walukuba and Mtogolo. We already have good relations and have extensively engaged the wider Walukuba community (17,000 people) through a series of performances, public debates, film showings and community waste collection actions, and have the wide support of local councillors and community leaders. In Mtogolo (12,000) people our partners have close connections and community leaders are supporters of the work.
3. Stakeholders in Jinja and Zomba. These include council members, church leaders, educationalists and local NGOs and CBOs. In Jinja we already have close links, and many have attended previous performance and knowledge exchange events. In Zomba we have good links via Chisiza, Chancellor College and YONECO.
4. Faculty of Arts staff at Chancellor College, University of Malawi, who are project partners.
5. Youth Net and Counselling, YONECO, who are project supporters. 
6. NGOs, INGOs and donors of community-arts based development programmes and community-based participatory research, in Malawi, Uganda and internationally: e.g. BOND (UK network for NGOs in international development), The Communication Initiative Network, ActionAid, Oxfam, UNESCO. 
7. Academics concerned with community arts and community-based participatory research: e.g academics working in human development, applied arts, human geography, applied anthropology.

How impact will be achieved.
Training: Members of both community groups will be offered high level, intensive training in key skills identified by them as essential to effective arts-based advocacy: support skills (community-based research, community management, planning, advocacy) and arts skills (theatre, film, photography, dance and music).
Performative events: In each community members will work with the project team to create performance and knowledge exchange events on the agreed themes using skills learnt. There will be an event for horizontal - community to community, and vertical - community to stakeholder - engagement in each context. It is expected that these performances will then be owned by the groups and used beyond the project framework.
Sustained communities: The project and training will be focused on giving communities the skills, confidence and cohesion they need to be long term self-sustaining arts-based community advocates.
Jinja and Zomba stakeholders will be invited to witness performative events, and fully participate in knowledge exchange events, building better understanding of community needs, and assisting them in effective delivery of community services.
Arts faculty at Chancellor College and YONECO staff will learn new particpatory approaches to community empowerment and will be assisted in developing new curricula and training packages reflecting cutting edge learning to replace what all concerned agree are outdated and too long unrevised training programmes.
NGOs, INGOs and academics will:-
a) have free access to the mutli-media online manual of techniques and methodologies, the community created book of the project experience, and the short films on project impact which we will promote through forums such as the Communication Initiative Network and BOND
b) be invited to attend and engage with performance and knowledge exchange events
c) be accessed via relevant conferences and journal publications
d) be offered presentations at relevant dissemination events and conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80626</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P009662/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA5B898B-8204-4E59-97AB-DA2B10124EED</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; Theatre - Other</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
