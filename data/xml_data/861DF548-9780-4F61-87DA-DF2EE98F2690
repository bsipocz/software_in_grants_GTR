The Institute will reduce the time-scales to translate discoveries to applications, provide strategic leadership together with training and career development in areas of particular need. 

The aim is to establish the Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials as an 'An international flagship for the accelerated discovery and development of new materials systems for the economic and societal benefit of the UK.'.
The SHRI will cover the invention and manufacture of Soft Materials; Functional Materials; Structural Engineering Materials and Energy Materials along with the necessary facilities to test and characterise them within a framework that emphasises the sustainable use of materials. 

Initially there will be 9 core material areas led by founding partners.
Chemical Materials Discovery
Biomedical Materials and Devices
Materials for Energy Efficient ICT
Atoms to Devices
2D Materials Systems
Advanced Metals Processing
Materials systems for Demanding Environments
Energy Storage
Nuclear materials


The Cambridge spoke of the Sir Henry Royce Institute is based at the Maxwell Centre at the University of Cambridge. The Cambridge Sir Henry Royce Institute activity will focus on Materials for Energy Efficient ICT, which has three overarching themes:
1. Materials for Energy Efficient Energy Generation with a focus on new materials and devices that are able to power autonomous devices by harnessing energy from the environment.
2. Materials for Energy Efficient Energy Storage with a focus on significant improvements in the energy density, longevity, cost and compatibility of the various energy storage technologies required to power the next generation of ICT devices.
3. Materials for Energy Efficient Use with a focus on radical approaches to reduce power consumption in processing and memory, towards the theoretical limits that are many orders of magnitude below current silicon-based technology (and are approached in biological systems).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Pathways to Impact for this funding will be realised through the collective benefits management activity for the Sir Henry Royce Institute.

The Materials for ICT facilities hosted at the University of Cambridge but linking the other Royce nodes, will provide a focal point for industry to identify the breadth and strength of the Royce 'Materials for ICT' activity. It will be designed to provide interaction between all TRLs from 1 to 5. It will provide an 'elevator' through the TRLs with the aim of creating a high knowledge throughput to accelerate the historically slow penetration of new materials. It will allow the chance to cross-fertilise knowledge between users of the facility from many departments, the ability to showcase the research to industry and to other top international ICT institutes. There are excellent opportunities for complementarity in facilities and research programmes across all Royce nodes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P024947/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
