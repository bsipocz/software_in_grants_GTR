Proteomics is a term used to describe all the proteins which make up a cell and determine how it functions. We propose to develop and deliver short courses which will train life science researchers in using the web-based tools and databases describing the structure of proteins in the cell. Skills in using this type of software to interpret genomic information will allow scientists to better understand the wealth of information available and design new experiments. We also intend to explain some of the techniques which are used in the laboratory to determine the identity of an individual protein isolated from a complex mixture such as a tissue extract, and understand the impact of experimental variations on the resulting data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is a growing need for training in bioinformatics and proteomics as scientists struggle to understand and explore the growing wealth of genomic and post-genomic data. We propose to hold a short course in Structural and Practical Proteomics to address the need for introductory teaching material for post-graduate students and research staff in the life sciences. The course will cover practical aspects of current technology such as mass spectrometry techniques for protein determination. A significant part of the course will address protein structure determination, complemented by on-line practicals in a supported environment. The course will take place over 5 days, and the teaching materials developed will also be used to provide a distance learning module for students. The course will be organised by members of the Bloomsbury Centre for Bioinformatics who have significant experience in delivering bioinformatics training to the academic community.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award was for a training course and has no research outputs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5AD41A27-3FE0-417B-9E1B-538DE8AD0D52</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545ba4ac10ce47.91869682</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This funding resulted in series of lectures on protein sequence and structure analysis, and use of GRID-enabled computing for protein science. This included developing both both slides and audio material. Accompanying sets of online practical exercises which reinforced concepts covered in the lectures were also produced. All course material was hosted in a flexible user-friendly virtual learning environment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The grant was awarded to deliver a graduate-level training course for researchers in the area of protein sequence and structure analysis. The tools developed to deliver the course included use of a virtual learning environment and software tutorial viewlets. The use of such tools for postgraduate-level training was demonstrated to other staff at UCL through the Teaching and Learning conference and network meetings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ECD5C5CA-590D-4ABB-B8F6-7B27C9DEE5FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ba4f790bed2.85174999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D007186/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
