It will be structured around four core activities.

1. Co-creation in the production chain: animations and guidance
Extending animation techniques (piloted in the award winning film The Adventure of the Girl with the Light Blue Hair - http://copyrightuser.org/the-game-is-on/), copyright opportunities and risks relating to co-creation will be presented as they arise in the production process. Each of the new animated resources will address a discrete stage (and key creative sector) in the developmental lifecycle of filmmaking. New animations will be supported by comprehensive user-friendly guidance designed for independent learning and reference, helping the user to explore and consider key copyright issues relating to the creative sector featured in each new animation. 

The British Film Institute (BFI) and lottery funded partner IntoFilm, the UK Intellectual Property Office and the Authors Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS) are collaborating partners.

2. Co-creation from cultural heritage: events and guidance
This activity seeks to improve understanding how copyright norms shape digital access to cultural heritage. Using the exemplar of Sherlock Holmes, two screening events will explore the creative reuse of the Sherlock character at the BFI Southbank in London and in Glasgow's new KelvinHall hub. The evolving journey of the notorious detective from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories illustrated by Sidney Paget to its most recent adaptations provides a compelling story to explore the role of copyright in relation to creativity, archives, and education. The events will bring together copyright law experts, film archivists and filmmakers, and will feed into new guidance through CopyrightUser.org and a new gateway - The Copyright Cortex - for UK memory institutions with the aim to unlock the creative potential of cultural heritage materials. 

The National Library of Scotland, the British Film Institute (BFI) and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) are collaborating partners.

3. Co-creation in policy deliberation: peer production of evidence
This activity will address neglected and under-represented stakeholder groups in the copyright policy making process, in particular micro-sized innovative firms and individual creators engaged in co-creation. We will provide new data-mining tools and open functionality via the MediaWiki software in order to facilitate a series of 'virtual town hall meetings' for these groups. This deliberative exercise will draw upon a pilot dataset of more than 600 individual scientific studies and reports, covering advertising, performance arts, music, film, photography, radio and TV broadcasting, print publishing and computer software. In consultation with a Wikimedian-in-residence, we will leverage peer-production opportunities to improve and scale up the dataset, involve new stakeholders and co-produce a shared evidence base relating to co-creation. Users will access, visualise and manipulate the evidence base and produce new findings which will support more effective policy representation. 

Wikimedia Foundation, N-Square Consultants and the UK IPO are collaborating partners.

4. UK Research and Innovation Network
CREATe will develop as a national catalyst, connecting expertise in law, social science and technology with stakeholders through a new national Research and Innovation Network for the Creative Economy. Three mobilisation engagements will be conducted throughout the UK, typically as part of existing industry events. These engagements will be flexibly supported with industry fellowships and commissions, responding to topical developments. 

CREATe will collaborate with the Scottish Games Industry at Dundee, KTN Ltd (Creative Industries) and the Digital Catapult.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The CREATe project has pioneered a digital engagement model with the creative economy that has been shown to be highly effective. Starting from an assessment of needs, it involves users in the creation of solutions. Two innovative platforms have been established for this purpose: CopyrightUser.org (aimed at creators, entrepreneurs and the general public), and CopyrightEvidence.org (aimed at policy). CREATe's techniques of engagement through animation (&amp;quot;The Adventure of the Girl with the Light Blue Hair&amp;quot;) and peer technology (Evidence Wiki) have become well known.

The programme of follow-on work for engagement and impact has been carefully developed in close consultation with stakeholders. Each activity is supported by collaboration, and will result in impacts as follows:

1. Co-creation in the production chain
The BFI will host a CREATe researcher as Copyright Education Fellow, with a substantial in kind commitment of &amp;pound;23,500. In close collaboration with film makers, copyright aspects in co-creation in the film production chain will be analysed, for example relating to co-authorship, copyright exceptions and licences. User friendly digital resources (animations and guidance) will be created in response to the identified needs, in particular of young screen writers and filmmakers.The IPO will endorse and disseminate our new resources through the Cracking Ideas portal (a government funded official portal - see letter of support).

2. Co-creation from cultural heritage 
A new digital resource - the Copyright Cortex - will be developed that acts as a gateway for UK-based archives, museums, libraries and other memory institutions - as well as those working in the digital humanities. The resources will engage with users through events (screening of Sherlock adaptations) and training modules. This activity has been conceived in response to an express need for guided knowledge development in the heritage community, facilitating decision making relating to digitisation andcreative re-use of digital cultural heritage (see CILIP and British Library letters of support). The sector is keen and ready to evolve sector wide best practice relating to copyright challenges. A change in behaviour will follow.

3. Co-creation in policy deliberation
This project will work with new stakeholder groups, in particular small and medium sized firms and single commercial creators which make up a significant portion of the creative economy. With the development support of an intern from Wikimedia (see Wikimedia letter of support), a series of 'virtual town hall meetings' will engage these difficult to reach stakeholder groups. A survey will be completed before and after the meetings, measuring the impact of the initiative. We will also scale up the Copyright Evidence Wiki to full collaborative peer-production. We will be able to track and measure the use of Wiki visualisations in policy representation. 

4. UK Research and Innovation Network
There is an important role for CREATe as a national catalyst for linking expertise in law, social science and technology to stakeholders. Our choice of partners and collaborators - high profile and established so we are able to target key influencers in the sector, and geographically distributed across the UK - will enable impacts that are conceptual (raising awareness in new sectors), capacity building (various forms of guidance) and provide enduring connectivity (through building a national research and innovation network). See letters of support from Digital Catapult, Creative Industries KTN, and Scottish Games Centre Abertay.

Throughout projects 1. - 3., we will pilot an accredited suite of information (such as Mozilla Badges) validating education and professional development undertaken. Activities typically will take hours (not days), and will be reasonably priced (in the CPD range). Income from these badges will contribute to sustaining CREATe's digital platforms in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161730</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P013341/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76CA364-1EB7-4253-A14B-30AFDCC72E94</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media &amp; Communication Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
