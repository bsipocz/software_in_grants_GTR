We introduce three innovations in this project. 

First, we shall investigate statistical models that directly predict key clinical variables so that clinicians can make more informed decisions. This approach is more consistent with guidelines-based prescribing that is used by general practitioners. 

Second, we will develop a way to identify patient groups by using data-driven methods. The approach used is similar to 'market segmentation' used in Business Intelligence. The hypothesis is that patients can be divided into groups not by their disease or stages (as currently practised) but by their patient records that essentially capture their health history. In essence, this method of grouping will naturally group patients with similar treatments including drugs and procedures and similar physiological and pathological characteristics. 

Third, as part of the process in predicting the efficacy of kidney function, we will develop a risk model for predicting and detecting Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). This novel model will inform clinicians how likely it is that a patient will suffer from AKI. In short, we propose a unified framework to predict the efficacy of kidney function that also considers the possibility of AKI. This represents a potential advancement in modelling and understanding CKD because the risks of end-stage of CKD and AKI are so far often treated independently. 

The potential advantages of the proposed method include: (1) better tailoring of the method to patient subgroups via data-driven stratification; (2) ability to exploit many more variables that are specific to each patient stratum; (3) ability to predict eGFR and ACR that can be used in conjunction with guidelines-based prescribing; (4) ability to predict Acute Kidney Injury. 

The main outputs of this proposal are: (1) patient-tailored eGFR predictor, (2) patient-tailored ACR predictor, (3) probabilistic AKI estimator, and (4) data-driven patient stratification. By patient tailoring, we understand that the model is capable of considering additional variables that are specific to a patient stratum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>OBJECTIVE: An overarching objective of this research is to revisit the problem of modelling the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and methodologies. The proposed approach differs from the conventional ones in the following ways: It emphasizes prediction over explanation; (2) builds customized statistical models over generic but covariates-adjusted model; (3) exploits the entire patient history rather than using pre-selected variables; and, (4) explores data-driven stratification over disease-centric stratification. 

INNOVATIONS: Specifically, we propose a mixture model approach to predicting key variables in CKD such as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), Albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), and Blood Pressure (BP). In addition, we also explore a novel data-driven patient stratification methodology. Last but not least, as part of the process in modelling eGFR, we also propose to develop a risk model for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) based on all available historic data from a patient record.

ADVANTAGES: The potential advantages of the proposed method include: (1) better tailoring of the method to patient subgroups via data-driven stratification; (2) ability to exploit many more variables that are specific to each patient stratum; (3) ability to predict eGFR and ACR that can be used in conjunction with guidelines-based prescribing; (4) ability to predict Acute Kidney Injury. 

OUTPUTS: The main outputs of this proposal are: (1) patient-tailored eGFR predictor, (2) patient-tailored ACR predictor, (3) probabilistic AKI estimator, and (4) data-driven patient stratification. By patient tailoring, we understand that the model is capable of considering additional variables that are specific to a patient stratum.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) BETTER REFERRAL TOOLS FOR GP CLINICIANS
The vast majority of CKD patients are monitored and managed by their GPs who have to make regular referral decisions. Through our commercial partner, TPP (the Phoenix Partnership), we will be able to help them provide general practitioners with better decision support tools so that they can in turn provide better care to patients with CKD. The software tools will provide better and/or more reliable ways to
- help GP clinicians to make referral decisions to specialists with confidence. Instead of interpreting the existing referral NICE guidelines (determining an 'accelerated decline in renal function' as a reduction of 5mL/min/1.73m2) of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate [eGFR] within a year or 10 mL/min/1.73m2 within 5 years), they will use our model to infer the likelihood of decline in renal function with predicted trajectory and confidence bounds;
- identify patients with high risk of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) -- this is an innovation that the project will develop;
- predict the eGFR trend and other variables (such as ACR, and blood pressure) by differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable variation in kidney function -- this is another innovative idea introduced by this project.

2) BETTER DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS FOR NEPHROLOGISTS
We develop better models that help nephrologists to better understand and monitor progression of CKD, especially when done remotely. This is particularly the case for the SEIK project where nephrologists would download the medical records of CKD patients and remotely monitor their conditions. Our software tool will automatically identify patients at risk of worsening conditions and at risk of AKI. This enables a new care model where high risk patients are brought to the attention of a GP clinician more proactively.

3) IMPROVED CARE EXPERIENCE
By improving care, patients at risk of progression to more severe stages of CKD will be monitored more closely. Better management implies improved quality of life and potentially cost savings in the long term.

4) BETTER/MORE COMPETITIVE SERVICE PROVIDED BY GP SERVICE PROVIDER
GP service providers could potentially use the developed models to predict eGFR, ACR, BP, and AKI at the point of care. This will improve the value they provide to their clients who are GP surgeries. Therefore, this ensures better service and better care.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>519780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>eGFR Time-series Analysis Using East Kent Data Set</gtr:description><gtr:id>000DA1AB-D21D-4FF4-94B6-9BC4453E2DF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster was presented in a conference organised by the British Renal Society (BRS) in 2015.
