Whilst there has been tremendous recent progress in the realisation of small-scale quantum circuits comprising several quantum bits (``qubits''), research indicates that a fault-tolerant quantum computer capable of harnessing the power of quantum mechanics will require a network of thousands of qubits. This goal is presently beyond the reach of any existing implementation based on a single physical qubit type.

Hybrid quantum information processing is an alternative approach that exploits the unique strengths of disparate quantum technologies, and offers a route to overcome the drawbacks associated with of a single-qubit architecture in direct analogy to the design of classical computing hardware. This proposal aims to combine three different technologies: 

 i) Superconducting circuits, with very fast (10 ns) gate times for fast processing,
 ii) Neutral atoms, with long (10 s) coherence times for long lived quantum memory,
 iii) Optical photons, for long distance fibre communication,

to create a novel hybrid quantum interface capable of storing, processing and generating highly entangled states of photons for quantum networking and cryptography applications, overcoming the short coherence time associated with the scalable superconducting circuit systems. This also offers applications in quantum metrology for conversion from optical to microwave domain quantum information, making it possible to extend the interface to incorporate a wide range of alternative solid-state based qubits.

The interface relies on use of highly excited Rydberg states, which have incredibly large dipole moments and transitions in the microwave regime, which can resonantly couple to superconducting qubits embedded in planar microwave waveguide cavities. The large Rydberg dipole also leads to strong, controllable interactions between atoms to provide a collective enhancement in the coupling to single photons for efficient storage and retrieval of light.

The first stage of the experiment is to trap spatially addressable atomic ensembles above a superconducting microwave resonator operating at 4 K to demonstrate strong coupling to the waveguide mode, a key milestone for implementing the hybrid interface. The ensembles will then be utilised to perform coherent storage and retrieval of optical photons, as well as generation of single photons using four-wave mixing. 

The second stage is to exploit the off-resonant interaction with the cavity to achieve controllable long distance (~1 cm) entanglement between a pair of ensembles trapped within a single microwave resonator. This will then be used to generate entangled photon pairs, exploring the benefits of collective encoding within the ensembles for achieving entanglement in the polarisation degrees of freedom for long-distance cryptographic quantum key distribution. The resulting hybrid quantum interface provides an ideal building block for establishing quantum networks. Long term this can be integrated with existing superconducting qubit technologies, making a significant step towards the realisation of scalable quantum computing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Academic Impact

This proposal addresses key questions relating to utilising hybrid quantum systems for creating scalable nodes for creation of quantum networks. This work will establish protocols and frameworks for performing high fidelity generation, storage and entanglement of single photons coupled to atomic ensembles trapped above a superconducting circuit, which can be directly translated to existing scalable superconducting qubit technologies.

2. Technological Impact

Quantum technologies (QT) are a rapidly growing area, with key new UK investments including the EPSRC Quantum Technology Network and funding innitiatives from InnovateUK. The proposed research has direct application in development of novel devices for quantum networking, offering a revolutionary new approach to information transfer and enabling large-scale secure networks utilising quantum based encryption as well as offering new limits in precision via quantum metrology.

3. Training

This proposal will produce highly trained personnel at levels from undergraduate to post-graduate, providing an important resource for future academic and commercial development of novel quantum technologies. The specific training in the interdisciplinary fields of atomic physics and superconducting quantum technologies provides a unique skill base.

4. Outreach

Both the PI and Strathclyde Physics department have an established track record in performing outreach to local school children through annual Open Evenings and one-off workshops organised as part of National science week. These activities will be continued with the goal of enhancing the profile of science and particularly novel quantum technologies within the local region.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>751013</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Glasgow Science Festival 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BB364E7-2573-407F-B60A-CBC78F1310E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A stand displaying the benefits of new quantum technologies including a live interactive demonstration of laser cooling was presented at a two-day event a the Kelvingrove Museum as part of Glasgow Science Festival.

The next steps will involve introducing a superconducting microwave cavity to enable the atoms to &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to each other and create correlations that do not occur naturally, which provide a mechanism by which to perform quantum key distribution, and incredibly secure protocol that enables two users to share encrypted data with no possibility of interception.

As part of this work, a new computational library has been developed in association with colleagues at Durham University to enable calculation of the properties of highly excited atomic states that are used to create the quantum states. This has been released open source to the community as a tool for all researchers and has been adopted for use by a number of international groups working in this area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The next steps of studying how a superconducting circuit can be combined with atomic qubits provides an exciting new approach to building technological devices harnessing quantum mechanics for communication, and could potentially realise a quantum repeater or quantum router that enables extension of the distance over which information can be communicated with single photons or how a network can be built to achieve this, making quantum encryption a reality. This will be of great interest to the telecommunications industry as well as those developing quantum computing architectures, and will demonstrate the success of this new approach.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2B2A3888-8F1E-414B-B0EE-F268AA08FB0B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd82b4086274.08375589</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B75C5C8-6D26-48A6-AEC8-EEFEABCFE717</gtr:id><gtr:title>Single atom imaging with an sCMOS camera</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5c7d459f3b0d04332857d6ca68f66610"><gtr:id>5c7d459f3b0d04332857d6ca68f66610</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Picken C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2feb0ead7017.69791089</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2A5C54F1-5EB6-4B03-B6C3-667678AC55D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>ARC: An open-source library for calculating properties of alkali Rydberg atoms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computer Physics Communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7235b43c21027f5e8ab8d65a539896a2"><gtr:id>7235b43c21027f5e8ab8d65a539896a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>?ibalic N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a79da0347b3d9.97407904</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N003527/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
