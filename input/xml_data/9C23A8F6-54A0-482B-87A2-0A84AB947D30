Healthy, functional lung that enables oxygen and waste gases to be exchanged becomes destroyed by this fibrotic scar, leading to respiratory failure. The most common of these disorders, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is increasing in incidence. It has no known cause and patients often present once already symptomatic with significant damage in their. There are no currently licensed drugs that have been proven to majorly reduce or reverse fibrotic scar tissue formation in these patients, and average life expectancy from diagnosis is currently only around 5 years.
When lung tissue is injured, some cells become activated and are responsible for producing scar tissue in the lung. These cells are normally in a resting state but once 'activated' they produce the components of scar tissue, and are more mobile. They move through the lung, depositing scar tissue as they go. Several cell types are thought to play a role in this, but myofibroblasts have received attention as playing significant role. Contact with scar tissue leads to further activation of cells and the process of scarring becomes a vicious cycle. Consequently breaking this cycle will provide insight into novel therapies for the disease.
In line with this, the focus of my research is to uncover how matrix is regulated during pulmonary fibrosis. My supervisor has discovered the transcription factor, SOX9 (SRY box-9) regulates matrix proteins during liver fibrosis. Deleting this factor in mice with liver fibrosis results in reduced scar and preserved liver function. Preliminary data in the lung has already shown that SOX9 is expressed in rodent and human models of fibrosis. These data are exciting and press the need to uncover whether SOX9-loss in lung fibrosis protects against the disease and to uncover whether SOX9 or upstream regulators could be targets for anti-fibrotic therapy. My research will investigate these questions: revealing exciting new insights into the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis, and identifying compounds with the potential to be developed into new treatments for this devastating disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Fibrosis, characterised by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, is a common feature underlying chronic lung diseases, for which idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and severe. Despite significant progress in defining the molecular basis of lung fibrosis, there are currently no effective anti-fibrotic therapies for clinical use. Understanding the direct transcriptional regulation of ECM in lung fibrosis, a critical component of the disease, could pave the way for urgently needed anti-fibrotic drugs. My preliminary data suggests the transcription factor SOX9 is increased in rodent and human models of lung fibrosis and plays a central role in ECM regulation. The objective of my research is to understand the role of SOX9 in pathological matrix deposition during lung fibrosis for targeted anti-fibrotic drug development. I will interrogate this through in vitro and in vivo models of disease.

This project's hypothesis is based upon developmental research and evidence of the role of SOX9 in matrix regulation other organ fibrosis. It is ambitious and exciting, backed up by pilot data that insists upon further research and supports reduction in SOX9 transcriptional activity as a method of abrogating pulmonary fibrosis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pulmonary disease (such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and clinicians are limited in the available treatment options: currently there are limited anti-fibrotic therapies. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lung fibrosis, and the identification of potential new therapeutic targets would benefit patients with lung disease, respiratory physicians and other clinical staff involved in their care. 

As this is pre-clinical research it would likely be many years before drugs arising from discoveries made here, were available for clinical use; nevertheless, this is still important. However, it remains possible that this research may highlight potential new applications for drugs already in clinical use, in which case, time scales would be much shorter. Results of this research may be commercially exploitable; e.g. for modulating SOX9 expression as a treatment for fibrosis and related conditions.

The availability of anti-fibrotic agents and the potential to arrest or reverse the fibrotic process would necessitate further planning for the screening and management of patients with pulmonary disease, or with the potential to develop lung disease. The results and implications of this research may therefore potentially be of interest to public health physicians. 

More broadly, new discoveries in the field of lung fibrosis may assist in advancing knowledge of the fibrotic process in other organs. As such, other patient and clinician groups may also benefit in the longer term. 

Finally, the research and transferable skills I will develop during this programme of research will enhance my professional development, enabling me to take the next steps towards becoming an independent researcher.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6EE0CF7D-F6CB-4891-BF56-7972D7C319AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Persistent air leak after pulmonary transplantation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ case reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce27315a3e99dfbc86a3bc34b1c70664"><gtr:id>ce27315a3e99dfbc86a3bc34b1c70664</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pearmain L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1757-790X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d32febbe956.59859391</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85333041-F3A6-479F-B79F-AD5A7996DF03</gtr:id><gtr:title>SOX9 predicts progression toward cirrhosis in patients while its loss protects against liver fibrosis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>EMBO molecular medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c6d5b12a38ada177266136b89e274ba4"><gtr:id>c6d5b12a38ada177266136b89e274ba4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Athwal VS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1757-4676</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d32fe7e6620.33074881</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R00191X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
