The obligation to comply with sanctions constitutes an important commercial consideration with numerous associated challenges that vary considerably according to sector. Implementation can be costly and complex and it can be difficult to determine whether compliance policies and procedures meet the challenges. However, the consequences of being found in non-compliance with sanctions are significant.

These regimes, notably US, UN and EU, target multiple economic sectors. However, while sanctions constitute a valuable tool for the international community to apply pressure on Iran to negotiate over its nuclear programme, the range and scope of the various regimes, and in many cases a lack of detailed guidance on implementation, mean that there can be uncertainty within industry with regard to their implementation. The obligation to comply with sanctions extends to a range of insurance products and activities, especially where these relate to commerce. Implementation can be costly and complex and it can be difficult to determine whether compliance policies and procedures meet the challenges. In terms of reinsurance, for example, ensuring compliance on broad-based, multi-activity coverage has become an important challenge for insurers. In this context, the shipping industry has been dramatically affected due to the implications of the sanctions on protection and indemnity insurance coverage. Unusual measures have in some cases been adopted; the government of Japan, for example, has extended sovereign insurance coverage to Japanese tankers affected by the EU oil embargo on Iran.
 
The consequences of being found in non-compliance with sanctions are far-reaching and can have an important impact on the commercial activities of affected firms. Firms thus have a strong interest in fully understanding and keeping pace with intricate and rapidly-evolving sanctions regimes. The proposed workshop will further industry knowledge and understanding with regard to the challenges and demands of sanctions and their effective implementation. Industry experts will have the opportunity to discuss their concerns with policy-makers, seek clarification on matters of compliance and implementation, and will gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by policy-makers in developing sanctions legislation.

The workshop will also benefit policy-makers. Sanctions are as much a political tool as an economic one and the political symbolism associated with implementing sanctions means that policy-makers are often required to develop and legislate on sanctions regimes without having enough time to fully consider the challenges that these regimes will pose to commercial stakeholders. The workshop facilitate a frank exchange with key industry actors and, consequently, afford policy-makers an opportunity to better understand and thus mitigate the challenges posed by sanctions to industry. On a larger scale, a better understanding of the challenges posed by sanctions to the insurance industry will inform the contribution of policy-makers to state-level efforts to strengthen sanctions regimes at the international level. 

Moreover, the challenges of sanctions vary from industry to industry and while there are a number of regional initiatives aimed at understanding sanctions, there is a distinct lack of industry-specific initiatives. In this sense, this UK-led initiative will serve as an international model that could be applied to different sectors in different countries.

Finally, much academic attention has been devoted to exploring the value and effectiveness of sanctions in redirecting the domestic and/or foreign policies of states. However, of this debate has been largely theoretical and focused on the macro-level of the state and international relations. Little academic scholarship has been devoted to exploring the micro-level, that is to say, the practical challenges faced by practitioners and policy-makers attempting to manage the implementation of unilateral and multilateral sanctions in a fluid and rapidly-changing context. An understanding of these challenges and how they can be mitigated or overcome will shed new light on the effectiveness of sanctions from the bottom up.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10337</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has made an original contribution to the debate around the use and effectiveness of sanctions. Scholars and policymakers continue to view economic sanctions as an important tool of coercive diplomay, even if the effects of sanctions on the policies of target states remain highly contested. Yet while considerable attention is devoted to sanctions at the state level, little has been done to explore the intricacies of sanctions at the working level of industry. Using sanctions on Iran as a case study, this project brought together a range of experts from academia, industry and the policy arena to explore the impact of sanctions on the insurance industry. The workshop revealed the challenges and obstacles (often unintended) that sanctions pose to legitimate commercial activities. The insights generated at this workshop contributed to a unique, 'bottom-up' analysis that explores the challenges of implementation and compliance that sanctions often pose for industry practitioners. This practical understanding of the complexities that characterise the sanctions landscape has, in turn, contributed to advancing understanding of the factors that influence the effectiveness of sanctions more generally.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09B2E613-BED0-4513-B786-BB9BB70C94C5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463351c554012.38080795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project resulted in a number of important findings:
1. To date, academic studies of sanctions have focused on sanctions at the state-level. Little attention has been devoted to exploring the complexities of sanctions at the working level of industry.
2. An understanding of the challenges posed by sanctions to industry can shed light on the broader factors influencing the success or failure of sanctions in terms of altering the policy direction of the target state. 
3. Dialogue around the impact of sanctions on industry can contribute to the construction of a more robust sanctions regime that exerts maximum intended influence without compromising legitimate commercial activities. The implementation of sanctions can pose a range of often unforeseen consequences that frequently obstruct legitimate commercial activities. Adverse consequences may be mitigated through a comprehensive and ongoing dialogue between policy-makers and industry stakeholders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project break new ground in terms of exploring the impact and effectiveness of sanctions at the working level of industry.
