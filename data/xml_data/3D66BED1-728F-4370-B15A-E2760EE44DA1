However, it has been dubbed by Professor Robert Crawford as Scotland's literary 'lost continent' due to the lack of sustained academic research into Scoto-Latin texts, and translation thereof. The Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum huius aevi illustrium (DPS, Amsterdam, 1637) is the most important of these neglected texts. A 1,272 page anthology of 37 of Scotland's neo-Latin poets, edited by the Fife laird Sir John Scot of Scotstarvit and the Aberdonian poet Arthur Johnstone, it represents the zenith of Scotland's burgeoning Latin culture during the renaissance and reformation. However, no translation of this anthology has ever been produced, or an attempt made to understand holistically what its contents tell us about Latin culture in early modern Scotland. This project aims to deal with this issue. It will produce an electronic resource that provides original scans of the text of 13 of the poets in the DPS, alongside a full transcription of the Latin and an English translation which will be fully searchable by scholars. The resource will provide a full critical apparatus for each text detailing all scriptural and philological references cited, and the historical and social context behind each poem. The resource will be supported by a range of articles analyzing the texts in both linguistic and historic contexts, along with a full range of biographical material on each poet, and broader essays on early modern Scotland's Latin culture. The website will also be open ended so that the remainder of the text not digitised and translated now can be added by scholars in the future. 
The poets chosen for translation are those whose work now exists solely or primarily within the DPS itself, and those whom we currently know the least about - several of them are only known to us because of the DPS. However, one key link between them is that they all worked and lived in Scotland in the reign of James VI and I. Nearly all of them came into contact with the royal government and court at some stage in their careers. Some, like the Royal Secretary John Maitland, directly worked for the king. Others, like the church reformer Andrew Melville, stood in opposition to his religious and political policies. Hercules Rollock relied on the king's favour to secure his job as Dundee grammar school master in 1582. Several contributors produced poetry for James' royal entries, including Henry Anderson at Perth in 1580, and Henry Danskin and Peter Goldman on the king's return to Scotland in 1617. The poets came from both sides of the confessional divide, but all used Latin as a shared mode of cultural expression and identity regardless of their confessional or political leanings, often as a means by which to impress their colleagues and the king himself. This thread of Scottish cultural expression, so clearly summarized and captured in the DPS, has never been explored, and the project aims to understand from the text when and why Latin was used in Jacobean Scotland, and to create a research tool that allows scholars to engage with this question. 
The poems in the DPS span a variety of genres inspired by classical models. They include pious homilies to Christ and vitriolic attacks on the Catholic church; astronomical and medical treatises; ribald satires on contemporary life and politics; and appeals to pagan deities for health and wellbeing, among many others. Collectively, they paradoxically show that neo-Latin humanist culture, with its reverence for the pagan and antique past, became immensely popular in Scotland at the exact same time as Scotland became one of the most doctrinaire Reformed countries in Europe. Given that most accounts of Scotland's post-reformation culture emphasize its commitment to a narrow form of Protestantism and severe moral and social discipline, how are we to explain this? One of the major aims of this project is to solve this paradox.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The interested public: 
While the Scottish reading public is well aware of the significance of Scots and Gaelic as part of its literary heritage, there is a near-total lack of recognition of the role that Latin has played in this canon. Only Professor Robert Crawford has attempted to deal with this deficit: his 'The Penguin Book of Scottish Verse' (edited with Mick Imlah, 2000) was the first anthology of Scottish poetry aimed at a general audience to include Latin verse; and his Scotland's Books (Penguin, 2007; OUP, NY, 2009) was the first history of Scottish literature to integrate the history of Scottish Latin poetry throughout its narrative. One of the main aims of this project would be to change public understanding and awareness of the role that Latin played in Scottish history and culture. This would be done primarily through a programme of public readings and talks, where performances of translations of the Latin material would also be given, at Scottish museums, libraries, and other heritage centres; the National Library; and at literary festivals such as Glasgow's 'Aye Write' and St Andrews' StAnza festival. This will be directed in line with advice from the representatives on the Knowledge Transfer Advisory Group. 

Schools, tertiary and further education: 
To further the aim of enhancing public knowledge of the role of Latin in Scottish culture, the project also intends to target those studying classics at school and in the undergraduate curriculum. The PI and the LR have been asked by the Association for Scottish Literary Studies to produce a hard-copy version of the Latin text and translations of the poets, which will include a broad-ranging introduction to the material, which can be used by Scottish students at all levels in secondary and tertiary education. It is intended that this form the first in a series of volumes making Scottish Latin accessible to students, and thus the project would inaugurate an essential collection of resources for a new generation interested in Scoto-Latin. 

Homecoming 2014: 
The Scottish Government has announced its intention to celebrate the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn with another Homecoming event following the success of Homecoming 2009. The resources produced by this project, highlighting a 'lost' element of Scottish culture, have an obvious potential to feature in these celebrations. There are too many imponderables to make it possible to see exactly how the project's outcomes will feature, but the strong academic participation in some of the events in Homecoming 2009 suggests that there should be occasions where this will be possible. 

New Media: 
The project will have its own Facebook and Twitter accounts, and these will be used to showcase findings from the project material, to celebrate news, events and milestones, and to link the project to wider discussions on social networking and news sites (such as BBC news) relating to Scottish culture and the arts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>338236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>StAnza: Scotland's International Poetry Festival</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>KE Partnership with Eleanor Livingstone and StAnza, Scotland's International Poetry Festival</gtr:description><gtr:id>CC814F68-6119-419D-A0B2-CCD97B291397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>i.

It also argued that the current debates on the referendum in 2014 could benefit from taking a more 'culturally' focused approach - ie, what are our shared values? - rather than the current predominant focus on economic arguments. The talk was also given to well-attended local history meetings in Ayrshire and Cumbria, and as part of 'Previously': Edinburgh's History Festival.

ii.

These events can be a revelation, such as when David McOmish, a classicist from Glasgow University, spoke about the Scots poets writing in Latin during the Jacobean period, a century of Scots intellectual culture which is only now being recovered.'

Specific sub-questions on this theme were: who used Latin in Scotland, when and why? Did the use of Latin vary according to social standing and profession? And what role did scripture, Greco-Roman literature, and Renaissance advances in philology play in texts produced by Scottish authors? 
The project produced editions of 11 poets, totalling 335 pages. The major unifying thread tying the electronic resource together is that all the texts (bar those of Robert Ayton) focus predominantly on the period between James' birth in 1566 and his accession to the throne of England in 1603. The Principal Investigator's large-scale bibliographical and prosopographical research into the culture of Scottish Latin texts printed between 1480 and 1700, undertaken as part of the project, has confirmed that the collection of poems in the resource represent every major 'political' poem commenting on events in James' 'Scottish' reign. Highlights include a previously unknown poem by Thomas Maitland on James VI's coronation which discusses the Battle of Langside (where Mary Stewart and the Earl of Bothwell were defeated); all the major poems on James' birth; an eyewitness account of his first royal entry into Perth in 1578 (by Henry Danskin); and the only poem written to celebrate his marriage by proxy to Anna of Denmark in 1589 (by Hercules Rollock). 
What, then, were the salient features of Scottish Latin literary culture in the early modern period? Firstly, for Scots in particular, their connections with the international community of Neo-Latin scholars were markedly French in character. The Scottish poets who we translated for the electronic resource were not merely tourists sampling France's literary and intellectual delights, but men like James Halkerston and Hercules Rollock were all creators of Latin literature that spoke directly to French affairs, and which earned them minor renown. All the poets who form part of the electronic resource undertook their original degree at St Andrews and then studied for varying periods in France and Geneva, and they all followed remarkably similar career paths into education, law, the church, or medicine. 
Secondly, a shared appreciation of all things Greco-Roman also bound together Scottish Latinists, and while this in itself is unremarkable, the depth of their knowledge and skill in this regard is often surprising. Classical knowledge could manifest itself in the imitation of a single text, as the numerous Scottish adaptations of Virgil's fourth eclogue, which discusses 'Britain, far sundered from the rest of the world' (line 66) and which is featured in poems by (for example) Patrick Adamson and Thomas Maitland. Many of the poets we translated interpret James VI and I as a long-awaited 'messiah' destined to unite the British Isles in a Protestant golden age, a theme prevalent in all the works celebrating his birth in 1566 (Thomas Craig, Patrick Adamson and George Buchanan) but which was also echoed repeatedly in poems across the course of his adult reign. 
Another key dimension of the corpus of early modern Scottish Latin literature was its particular vitality in the decades after 1603. The PI's database-driven survey of all printed Latin texts by Scottish authors has revealed that the publication of Scottish Latin texts, particularly poetry, reached its zenith in James' later reign, before a swift and irrevocable process of decline that began at almost exactly the same time as the publication of the DPS. Much of this literature was produced in connection with the accession of King James to the English throne, and the royal visits of 1617 and 1633. 
Finally, and curiously, while many of the poets write in part or in whole on religious matters (Andrew Melville, Adam King), it was both surprising and perplexing that much of this religiosity was couched in Classicising terms - for example, God is frequently represented as Jupiter or Zeus, Satan as Pluto - with no apparent discomfort or tension between the largely-Calvinist sensibilities of the authors and their knowledge of antiquity. Poets also wholly adopted models and tropes of Classical poems, even when this might seem to contravene the views of the kirk - for example, Thomas Maitland wrote a series of love elegies and hendecasyllables modelled on Tibullus, Propertius and Catullus that feature adultery, cuckoldry, and strong obscene and phallic imagery. Maitland was likely Catholic, but other poets, such as the firmly Calvinist Hercules Rollock, also dabbled in obscene poetry. The project has translated a rich array of material showcasing these forms of Classical reception, and examination of how these are fused into Calvinist and Christian settings by the poets promises to be a major avenue of future research for the PI.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although the project has mapped out the broad nature and extent of early modern Scottish Latin culture between 1480 and 1700, and produced a resource of every major poem relating to James VI and I up to and including 1603, many areas of this culture remain un-examined, and there is still much we do not know. The project resource itself contains translations and basic contexts provided for each poem (in the linguistic and historical footnotes to each text), but they are waiting for a range of scholars, from undergraduates to full-time academics, to undertake systematic analysis and discussion of them. Beyond the resource, the PI's large-scale prosopographical analysis has identified a wealth of texts to be tackled that await translation, and it is a happy irony of the project that while we set out to find out about Latin culture in Jacobean Scotland, our collection produced very little in the way of texts post-1603. There is clearly scope for another major project looking at the Latin response in Scotland to the period after the Union of the Crowns. Finally, the full extent of Latin manuscript sources by Scots remains to be mapped, even to a rudimentary degree. The nature of Scottish contributions to the development of nascent scientific disciplines - engineering, mathematics, astronomy, medicine - and the networks of men, particularly in Edinburgh, who perpetuated their study and advancement in a Scottish context has begun to be examined by the project lead researcher in a series of articles in the project's edited collection of essays and in the Innes Review. The picture emerging from epistolary, manuscript and literary evidence pertaining to men like Adam King and the Craig family suggests that engagement with the early developments of what we would recognise as 'modern' empirical science was an underlying feature of Scottish intellectual life between the Reformation and Enlightenment. How far this culture reached, and to what extent it shaped the culture that emerged to span the globe in the Enlightenment, is an important question that remains unanswered, as is the exact reason (or reasons) as to why production of Scottish Latin texts grew markedly in popularity after 1603, when one would expect the reverse to occur as Scotland moved into closer union with England. Further research into both these aspects of Scottish Latin culture is not only highly necessary, but has the potential to fundamentally alter our conception of the Scottish intellectual landscape in the seventeenth century.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C3A17A45-412D-4702-8C38-F7725B052815</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b9b3f47f294.83450935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.dps.gla.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This electronic resource is the core project output, and comprises: a critical edition of 11 of the 37 poets from the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum (Amsterdam, 1637), made up of scans of the original text, transcriptions, and full translations with critical and contextual apparatus; a range of short critical essays ('features') examining the poets and the themes of their texts, and discussing key research issues in relation to Scotland's Latin cultural heritage (for example, print trends in Latin texts by Scottish authors); and a series of additional bibliographical and learning resources (audio recordings of Latin texts, and a full scan of the whole DPS text).
