Examples range from 'small-tech' materials constructed at the atomic level through to 'large-tech' infrastructures enabled by the internet and other complex systems. Irrespective of their physical scale, emerging technologies have the potential to drive and support sustained economic growth. For some of these technologies, the projected markets for the middle of the 2020s are enormous: hundreds of billions of US dollars each for nanomaterials, smart grids, industrial biotechnology and plastic electronics. In these areas and others, the UK is in a strong position to lead technology development and commercial exploitation. In particular, small businesses which are so vital to employment and economic stability are well placed to capitalise on technological innovation because of their relative agility. However, realising these opportunities critically depends on the capacity to translate scientific advances and technological developments into product ideas that are suitable for manufacture, distribution and use.

Whilst emerging technologies can be entirely new, they most often result from new combinations of existing technologies, or are analogous to existing systems in some important way. The ability to identify and integrate knowledge, skills and processes from these other systems determines the rate at which the commercial and societal value of emerging technologies is realised. This entails design knowledge and design processes that are flexible and deployable across a broad range of rapidly changing technologies. However, because emerging technologies are potentially so disruptive, they pose a problem to traditional design methods. In particular, they present a three-part challenge of uncertainty, complexity and rapidity: uncertainty because there is no reliable foresight into what kind of technologies should be designed for; complexity because there is increasing interdependence between, and integration of, different types of systems; and rapidity because the rate at which new technologies are being introduced far outstrips the evolution of those previous technologies for which typical engineering design methods were developed.

Because designing for emerging technologies requires methods that can respond to uncertain, complex and rapid developments, there is a need for solution principles that are generally and readily applicable. Innovation could then be promoted if designers were able to review, combine and contrast these principles and apply them to specific technologies. This prompts the question: what design principles can best influence the development of engineering design methodologies for emerging technologies. The project will answer this question, by gaining an understanding of the underpinning systems that emerging technologies are made up of or built into. Multiple system types will be investigated, along with the attributes of those systems and the system behaviours that those attributes promote. Comparative analysis of industrial case studies will show how decisions are made about the trade-off of one principle against another, and will permit the development of guidance that is concrete and actionable. By doing so, the project will provide engineers with the cross-domain knowledge of systems that they require to design for newly emerging technologies and for technologies that have not yet been imagined.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The IdEAS project will engage with industry, with policy makers and with media agents to ensure that the research is maximally relevant and best presented for impact. 

Industry collaboration: Industrial collaborators will initially be drawn from the Cambridge area, the most important entrepreneurial hub in Europe. This area is home to a cluster of companies, that often originate in or have strong links with the University, and many are members of the Cambridge Network, an organisation that promotes collaboration and problem sharing amongst over 1500 company members. The IdEAS project will be registered as a member of the Cambridge Network, thus gaining access to direct communication channels with organisations working at every stage in the technology development process. The national and international contacts of these organisations will then be leveraged to pursue further collaborations.

Policy workshops: The IdEAS project will work with the Cambridge Centre for Science and Policy (CSaP), which links researchers directly with the policy professionals who will benefit from understanding the implications of the research. In particular, the project will run two CSaP Policy Workshops on the project theme. These workshops represent a tried and tested formula for bringing policy makers from across relevant governmental organisations together with researchers and industry, allowing highly effective knowledge exchange and network building.

Policy fellow: The IdEAS project will work with CSaP to appoint a project-related policy stakeholder or influencer to the role of Policy Fellow. Following the search, identification and recruitment of a suitable individual, CSaP will arrange a series of meetings with approximately 30 researchers as part of an &amp;quot;immersion week&amp;quot;. CSaP will also support further networking activities in order to engage the Fellow over the two-year duration of the Fellowship.

Film production: The IdEAS project will work with Living Projects (LP), a bespoke film production company. They will create broadcast quality videos tailored to educate industry, the public, the media and policy makers about the implications of designing for emerging technologies. LP will work to produce a series of high-impact films that can be distributed across multiple platforms and that exploit the power of social media. These films will be scripted and produced for effective communication with a range of specific audiences.

Infographics: The IdEAS project will work with the technological trend bureau, Envisioning Technology (ET), in communicating about the technology landscape and the implications of designing for emerging technologies. ET will construct interactive infographics for websites (with static and animated equivalents for print and video). These will communicate the research findings to the media, the public, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and industry, encouraging their involvement with the project.

Twenty-one policy makers, academics and industry practitioners participated in the workshop. They collectively represented a diverse set of government departments and industry sectors and fields, including defence, space systems, transport, urban planning, health care, and psychology. Although from very different fields of expertise, the participants all worked on complex socio-technical systems and were concerned with how to make those systems more resilient. This permitted the exchange of information and perspectives across traditional boundaries.

The properties that systems exhibit such as modularity, redundancy, resilience and robustness can be difficult to understand and relate to each other. This is especially the case when considering types of system (such as biological systems or technological systems) that are seemingly very different but exhibit similar properties. By reviewing how system properties are considered and applied across different disciplines, we have collected and developed representations of system properties that distinguish and relate them. Holding workshops and conducting interview studies with various stakeholders has additionally revealed the key aspects of resilience that must be communicated and the diagrammatic tools that can assist in that. // 

2) Tool requirements. Much design research seeks to develop tools for designers to use in their work (e.g. tools that provide information or inspiration). In such cases, designers are the users of tools and researchers are the developers of tools. However, there is very little work on the user requirements that designers have for the tools that researchers develop. We have collected and related the user requirements across various fields, especially human computer interaction, creativity support and analogical design. As a result, we now have a much clearer understanding of what tool users require and what trade-offs must be negotiated in meeting those requirements. //

3) Design fixation. Knowledge of existing solutions can hinder innovation. This had previously been researched through controlled experiments that lacked a strong connection to industrial practice. By conducting qualitative research with expert designers, we have described the phenomenon of design fixation as it relates to the many factors that shape design projects (including people, organisations, processes, tools, etc.). In particular, we find that recognising fixation episodes and reflecting on them can be the means by which designers guard against such episodes in the future and thus become more creative. Furthermore, we have developed new a new experimental paradigm that permits for a much more controlled investigation of the phenomena of interest. // 

4) Complex Design. Design approaches are adopted when addressing many complex problems. However, it is not always clear when the approaches applied to one complex problem might be applied to another. By studying design practices in the fields of Synthetic Biology and Swarm Robotics, a framework has been developed that allows users to identify the ways in which complexity is being characterised, the design objectives that are held and the design approaches that are employed. This helps to see beyond superficial similarities and differences in complex design problems to see where practices can be shared. To assist with this we have worked with a science communication agency to publish a freely available 'primer' on complex systems. //

5) Entrepreneurial Pivoting. Technology entrepreneurs are often described as 'pivoting' when changing from one business direction to another. A series of interviews were conducted with technology entrepreneurs (founding or working with startups) and the advisors who guide them (often serial entrepreneurs themselves). The interviews focussed on how entrepreneurs set, maintain and change ('pivot') the direction of their ventures. This showed that entrepreneurs must balance an open, flexible, opportunistic approach with the need to be persistent, tenacious and committed. For entrepreneurs and their advisors, managing this tension is made more challenging by a range of individual factors (e.g. excessive confidence, avoiding information) and organisational factors (e.g. the absence of hard constraints, inflexible business offerings).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) System properties. The representations that we have developed can be used to support communication between diverse stakeholders in a systems design/analysis project. // 

2) Tool requirements. The user requirements that we have collected and related can be used by researchers to develop more effective and more readily accepted design support tools (especially for analogical design, such as biomimetics). //

3) Design fixation. The qualitative account of fixation that we have developed can be used by researchers to plan more focussed fixation studies. It can also be used by the developers of design and innovation techniques to frame their work in ways that best gain acceptance by practitioners. Our new experimental paradigm can be used by researchers to conduct more controlled creativity experiments. // 

4) Complex Design. The fields of Synthetic Biology and Swarm Robotics might directly use the framework developed to better understand the variations within each field and the connections between them. Other fields might also use the framework for similar purposes, with or without some modification. The primer we have published might be used by a broad range of practitioners to better understand what they and others mean by complexity. //

5. Entrepreneurial Pivoting. Our findings suggest that the pivot can usefully be considered as a creative act, leveraging concepts of fixation to explain how opportunities to pivot might be overlooked or avoided. Other creative practices outside entrepreneurship might therefore employ the idea of pivoting as a model for promoting conceptual change. In particular, designers might be encouraged to employ pivoting strategies in their design work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>68B53A65-88B6-4E5A-84E7-596B9905991D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544cf4921a3598.40820032</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www-edc.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/designpractice/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data collected from a medium-scale experiment (N = 303) conducted with undergraduate engineering students at the University of Cambridge (Engineering Department) in 2015.
