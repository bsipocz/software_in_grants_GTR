across the UK food system</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M00306X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Like the rest of the developing world the UK is experiencing demographic change. There are currently 10.8 million people aged 65 or over in the UK and over 1.4 million are aged 85 or over. The numbers of centenarians has nearly quadrupled since 1981, from 2,600 to over 12,000 in 2010. The number of people aged 60+ is expected to be more than 20 million in the UK by 2031 and the number of individuals aged over 85 years is predicted to double in the next 20 years and nearly treble in the next 30 (Age UK 2013). A significant minority of older people have ongoing health conditions and for those aged over 85 up to two thirds has a disability or limiting long term illness. Two thirds of NHS clients are aged 65 and over (Philip 2007). Such statistics and demographic shifts highlight that addressing when, how and why older people might become vulnerable through the food that they eat should be a research priority in terms of impact on the UK food system, quality of life for individuals, better public health outcomes, reducing the burden of disease and disability not to mention the resultant economic benefits for the UK. 
Whilst food security and the UK food system itself are relatively secure, the potential for older people to become vulnerable could be strengthened, weakened or influenced by a number of external factors, though no research has explored such factors broadly in relation to the older population. Older people might disproportionately acquire food from different parts of the food supply chain and civil society compared with other groups of the population as they are perhaps more likely to encounter food delivery services marketed directly at them and the health professionals who care for them and through social enterprises serving food, such as 'meals on wheels' and Age UK lunch clubs.
The ways that vulnerability linked to the food system might operate for different groups of older people is not straightforward but a framework for assessing different domains of vulnerability - exposure, threats, coping capacities and outcomes is proposed. Trust is thought to be an integral part of relationship building between actors in the food system and consumers are increasingly being viewed as having an active role in the trust relationship. It is unclear whether and how civil society actors within the food system undertake to build and market trust or whether the mechanisms by which trust operates or is perceived by consumers is different when the commercial sector is not involved. Assessing older people's own views on trust and their experience of different actors at the point that food is acquired is therefore important.
We have reviewed the datasets available via the UK Data Service and found none matches the study objectives. New data will therefore be collected and a qualitative approach used. In the first phase of the study the research team will use interviews, photography/photo-elicitation, video observation and other techniques designed to engage participants including the use of diaries with 25 households drawing on a broadly ethnographic approach to investigate the food acquisition practices and perceptions of trust of a range of household types incorporating individuals aged 60+ years. These findings will inform 4-6 focus groups with older people (Phase Two). Finally, a consensus event with stakeholders from across the UK food system will be organised to debate and critique the findings from the first two phases (Phase Three). To maximise public engagement, and ability of a lay audience to more fully participate in the study, we will develop an interactive exhibition. Members of the public, through the Public Involvement in Research group, will be a key part of the approach taken throughout the research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a range of non-academic beneficiaries from the proposed research; impact will be created in the short through longer term. At the heart of this proposal is the aim to enhance the food system and quality of life of older people. This has impacts in terms of health, wealth and culture for the food supply chain, civil society, local authorities, central Government departments and the general population. Building an evidence base about vulnerabilities in the food system will provide opportunities to ensure that the UK food system is fit for purpose in terms of providing food that tastes good, is nutritious, safe and that minimises food (and therefore economic) waste through attention to portion size. The proposed study will support the development of food products and services that are safe and nourishing. The findings will support evidence based policy making at local, regional and national level as well as informing studies worldwide about the development of safe services in countries with an ageing population. Benefits for policy include the potential for keeping older people well, preventing malnutrition and helping people to remain in their own homes; this could impact on use of primary care health services and reduce hospitalisation rates. Identifying and mitigating risks to older people from vulnerabilities in the food system will increase effectiveness of public services. There is potential for significant economic development for the private sector in terms of development of food products that appeal to older people as well as with regard to new models for the delivery of food-related services in the community. This may also impact on the civil society/third sector in terms of social enterprise for the delivery of services. Social impact and benefits for the wider population will be created in terms of identifying best practice in the current food system and making recommendations for the enhancement of meals and services; e.g. recommendations about community-based meal services to prevent social isolation could arise from the proposed study.
To summarise, impacts will be created in:
The food supply chain- manufacturers, retailers, delivery companies.
Private sector organisations providing care for older people in their own homes, (who often provide support with food preparation/cooking).
Kitchen companies, product/technology design, housing design - in terms of using findings about how kitchens/technologies/housing/town planning enhance and make safer the food system and older people in their own homes.
Civil society actors - social enterprises and others supplying food for older people e.g. Meals on Wheels, Age UK lunch clubs and other services.
Other 3rd sector/charitable organisations tasked with enhancing the life of communities: e.g. the Food and Health Alliance; Community Food and Health (Scotland), Age UK (national and local), Alzheimers Society, food banks, Carers Organisations, faith organisations as well as direct services such as community food support, (eg Age UK Hertfordshire provides support at potentially vulnerable times such as following discharge from hospital).
Government departments. FSA in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; Department of Health; DEFRA, Association of Directors of Social Services.
Local authorities (including social services) and county councils -improve the effectiveness of services, food safety (environmental health).
Health services - Cost saving through reducing potentially avoidable use of GPs/other primary care and hospital services through improved/strengthened food systems. 
The research design and methods used will benefit non-academic users of research, particularly those interested in the use of visual methods and the dissemination of visual research. E.g. Jude England and Polly Russell at the British Library and Erik Klein Wolterink, a Dutch photographer interested in kitchen design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>268029</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We secured a small research impact grant from the University which helped us make an animation aimed at children and young people, to engage them in food security in later life. the FSA are keen that children help older people to remain food safe.</gtr:description><gtr:id>900DDD76-D92D-427F-9262-F44ADDDA6C29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None noted yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7af0c3d6ad3.61667010</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Animation for younger people</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCAsncnpdEo</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We came across the idea of Participology, which was developed by Birmingham City University with an ESRC Grant Number ES/M006522/1. we adapted this using scenario case studies based on our research findings. the game was 'played' by stakeholders at our stakeholder conference to get them to think about the realities of shopping for food in later life.</gtr:description><gtr:id>29F12A59-2991-4A47-A6B9-AB8E297CBC95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It certainly facilitated a more indepth discussion among stakeholders than if we had just presented the findings and taken feedback. the ensuing discussion is informing the policy briefings we are now writing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7adba7b3ac5.91610559</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Participology board game on food in later life</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>we exhibited our photographic, video and other findings at an interactive exhibition at the University of Hertfordshire in June 2016, attended by 1000-1500 people.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDCB73D1-D78C-4EF4-864D-682D5CBBB0F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further deepened our relationship with our co-funders the food Standards Agency, who felt the exhibition impacted on their understanding of food safety and security in later life. the exhibition impressed the University Court and board of governors, which will stand us in good stead for support for future projects and building capacity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ae36315f99.31122118</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>25 Lives seen through food exhbition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Hertfordshire</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

Between 1000-1500 people attended and we received overwhelmingly positive comments about the way the exhibition evoked memories of grandparents and 'days gone by'; our ophthalmology colleagues said they learnt lots about how visual impairment prevents ease of food shopping; our policy colleagues from Food Standards Agency and DEFRA said it had highlighted the benefit of social science for food policy work and also highlighted how they need to change their messaging to impact on the general public about food safety. Our study participants were treated to a VIP tea party and met the local mayor, who opened the exhibition. The University Court and board of governors also attended which gave us a unique opportunity to show how much impact our research was having.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7a81a1861e8.48300014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.foodprovisioninlaterlife.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>vulnerability workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D72DCD9-18D2-4615-8656-9E671DC0C4D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were invited to participate at a workshop on Vulnerability organised by the Policy Lab, DEFRA, the Cabinet Office and FSA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b7db2c0456.78535524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Health Festival - Hatfield</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AD8120D-4535-4ED0-8935-5D0DF6CB22B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We had a stall at Hatfield health fest on a Saturday in the town centre, in June. the aims were to tell local people about the research and to ask if they wished to be informed about our public exhbition plans. we used leaflets, a Twitter hashtag exercise and activities to engage children.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cac40142a6b9.42611151</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.foodprovisioninlaterlife.com/#!Promoting-research-at-local-festivals/c23zg/56001b160cf25fa7fe1243b9</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>research impact grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Hertfordshire</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>39C7F55C-04F0-4C66-95D4-ADFA9FD3D21C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cac60c447065.10366292</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings are having an impact on the general public, on retailers and on policymakers, particularly in relation to shopping for food in later life. This theme from our research has really caught the imaginations of audiences and there is widespread for support for the notion that shopping is not 'just' about food, it's about social encounters, engaging people in physical activity and about ensuring people can be independent for as long as possible. Supermarkets are interested in hearing more about the findings as we develop them and an organisation called Slow Shopping has introduced principles to supermarkets that chime with our findings and we are looking at ways to further enhance this relationship. We have been contacted by a range of third sector organisations with an interest in supporting older people to shop and live well in later life.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A77C1579-70A3-43A7-A330-818142A2B28E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb361a7ea2a7.54076991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our findings show that acquiring food in later life is inherently linked with:
1. social networks
2. the food environment
3. coping strategies
4. the ageing body
Older people need strong social networks to enable them to remain food secure; it can be one good relationship (eg with a neighbour or milk man) that helps them to cope, or it can be having a wider network of friends and allies.
The food environment works for or against older people e.g. supermarkets can be daunting, large places for frailer people to navigate or they can enhance the shopping experience e.g. through having seating available and clean, accessible toilets and disabled parking spaces.
Older people learn to cope though the more that factors build up the harder this becomes e.g. coping with illness or hospitalisation, bereavement, isolation, closure of lunch clubs or local shops can all add up to tip older people towards vulnerability.
Getting older is often associated with multiple health conditions and failing capacity either physically and/or mentally and this further muddies the navigation of the food landscape e.g. failing eyesight means reading food labels is harder and leads someone to be unable to drive; developing diabetes leads to additional food needs. depression leaves people isolated and unable to ask for help to get food.
Being aware of the above factors means agencies, local authorities and families etc can ensure older people remain food secure and safe for as long as possible.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are working with supermarkets on how they can draw on our findings to enhance their services and environment for older people.
The food standards agency are keen that we further develop our findings to maximise their impact on older people's food safety and food security.
the findings are of interest to a range of third sector/social enterprise organisations such as Meals on Wheels services.
The research is leading to a range of ongoing conversations about further research, evaluation and application of the findings for the good of older people and their carers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DE8AD668-9FB0-46FE-A688-EE547BB5D6C5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb35e34c49f4.61108675</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>379C9E59-6D27-459A-B5F4-F8885D743EC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supermarkets, food security and ageing.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/21a8dc99be885652f870aec15d7b292f"><gtr:id>21a8dc99be885652f870aec15d7b292f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dickinson, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b4a2414a88.31347806</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F68D1739-90FB-422A-AC28-5C16EF936C3A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring 'health' through the everyday food acquisition practices among the over 60s</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc0412358a341d223d1c09d680aa0bd9"><gtr:id>bc0412358a341d223d1c09d680aa0bd9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>IKIODA F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cafe37bf14d1.26659088</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A506F4A-F002-4367-AC09-0B15B64357B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Picturing the question: Framing food practices through participatory visual methods with older adults</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51cebddcb97f8d3f1af4d8e9303cf8b0"><gtr:id>51cebddcb97f8d3f1af4d8e9303cf8b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Godfrey-Smythe, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7b8b8857598.40375979</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M00306X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB391BE-87E7-4006-A2C5-43ED9DBA773C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural and Anthrop Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73304753-7B2F-432F-BACE-578EEECC772A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marketing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
