The research is highly relevant and timely as the UK government has set a target that all new houses must be zero-carbon by 2016 and that the use of MGTs will be needed to meet this target. The widespread introduction and use of MGTs will have significant implications. For energy providers, MGTs will move the balance away from centralised energy generation and distribution towards a decentralised model. MGTs will enable end-users to generate electricity for their own use with any surplus being sold to the grid company. In addition, the installation of MGTs has been found to significantly shift end-users awareness, attitudes and behaviour towards improved energy efficiency. For MGT manufacturers and installers, the substantial increase in demand will expand the MGT market and offer new business opportunities and challenges. Finally, for housing developers, the integration of MGTs will require radical innovation in their business strategies, supply chain management, design and production. The successful diffusion of MGTs in the new build housing sector will therefore need multi-level changes across institutional, supply chain and end-user actors. The uptake of MGTs so far has been extremely small. Research to date on the barriers to MGT diffusion has pursued a limited 'technology push' perspective. This perspective has generally ignored the critical social and market dynamics which shape (and are shaped by) the development and use of MGTs. The proposed research adopts a socio-technical network analysis approach which is needed to properly understand the conditions and processes which facilitate (or hinder) the creation and solidification of appropriate supply chains and end-user strategies and practices. These conditions and processes will vary from country to country. Lessons and good practice may therefore be identified and shared through cross-country comparisons. The programme of work in the project involves three principal streams of integrated activity. First, six UK housing development case studies will be undertaken which will investigate the MGTs employed in particular developments. Housing development case studies will be produced and, from the fieldwork, three key MGTs used in new build housing will be identified. Second, these prioritised MGTs will be the focus of three UK MGT case studies which will concentrate on the particular MGTs and associated manufacture(s). The work will result in MGT case study reports and an analytical framework to allow comparisons between MGTs and between national institutional contexts. Third, the analytical framework will be used to conduct a comparison between France and the UK. EDF researchers will conductthe fieldwork in France. The comparison will allow the integration of cross-national data and comparative institutional analysis of the effect of national conditions on variations in the socio-technical networks supporting the design and deployment of MGTs. The project will benefit from having the following as industrial partners: the National House Building Council Foundation, the Home Builders Federation and the British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers Association. The partners are highly regarded in their sectors and their views are sought by government as the 'representative voice' of the industry. The academic project team from the EPSRC funded Innovative Manufacturing Research Centres at the University of Reading and the University of Salford has a proven track record in leading and managing successful collaborative funded projects. Further, the academic team has the multi-disciplinary expertise required for the project: the delivery of sustainable housing; new product development in high technology sectors; procurement and supply chain management; and, socio-technical network analysis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81165</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Property Tectonics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Carbon in Homes Driving Licence</gtr:description><gtr:id>3C26BAB4-AC88-461D-B44B-9E431F54581D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d54030b9d5404e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The Carbon in Homes Driving Licence is a commercial partnership between the University of Salford and Property Tectonics.

There is currently a comfort and confidence in traditional systems compared to fear and suspicion at the unfamiliarity of other systems. 



It was felt by some practitioners that there is a disconnect between the objectives of the carbon reduction strategy and the effect that the incentives have in practice.

Uncertainty and change in policy is viewed as especially damaiging by LZC imanufactures, suppliers and installers



Social landlords are seen to be leading the way with the uptake of technologies. and Housing associations noted as an effective route to market

There is a belief from manufacturers that the main drivers for house builders for the use of LZC technologies are the quickest and most cost-effective route to meeting regulatory requirements.



For existing organisations in the Solar Thermal &amp;amp; Heat Pump sectors, the development of LZC has presented an opportunity to take a more holistic approach across divisions and by using different components to create a single package for new housing.



Photo-Voltaic is assessed as the largest market currently. While this might change with the introduction of RHI, the initial FIT tariff incentives has had a significant impact on the market. Given the fact that the supply chains for PV are now comparatively well established other technologies will have to compete not only in comparative technical terms and ease of regulatory compliance, but also in terms of the cost, uncertainty and the disruption of establishing new alternative supply chains.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Learninbg from the project has helped in the development of a joint venture with Property Tectonics for the establsihment of the online training package - the Carbon in Homes Driving Licence The academic findings have informed the development of a co-authored book 'Perspectives on Construction Innovation'
