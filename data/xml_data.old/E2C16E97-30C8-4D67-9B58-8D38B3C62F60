1) Prof. Sharon Aviran's lab develops statistical models and statistical inference methods for
analysis of RNA structure and dynamics by combining experiments with statistical and biophysical
principles. She previously introduced a novel approach to modeling and to automatically
processing next-generation sequencing data from a new generation of multiplexed RNA structure
mapping assays. This work pioneered the use of mathematical modelling and statistically sound
analysis methodology for robust and efficient quantification of chemical mapping information, an
approach that is now becoming a standard in the field. She received a K99/R00 award from
NIH/NHGRI to pursue work on modelling and analysis of RNA structural dynamics. Prof. Aviran's
lab and Dr. Ding's lab have initiated collaborative discussions to develop a novel platform that
combines innovative computational and experimental methods.
2) Prof. Elizabeth Tran has established a strong reputation in RNA biology. She has determined
the functions of RNA helicases in the regulation of RNA-protein complex that are critically
important since DEAD-BOX proteins and regulatory cofactors have been linked to cancer (breast,
colon, lung), neurodegenerative disorders, and viral replication (HIV). She has also studied the role
of long non-coding RNAs in gene regulation. Prof. Aviran and Dr. Ding recently established
informal collaborations with Prof. Tran's lab with initial suggestions on deep sequencing analysis
and RNA structure probing techniques.
3) Dr. Zo&amp;euml; Waller's lab has substantial expertise in organic synthesis, biophysics, nucleic acid
chemistry and molecular biology. Her lab has been studying one of the well-known structure
motifs: i-Motif. She has extensive experience in studying the biophysics and structural dynamics
and conformations of non-canonical nucleic acids. She has also generated small molecules to alter
the formation of DNA/RNA structure formation; these have great potential in therapeutic and
nanotechnology applications. Dr. Waller currently has a BBSRC-funded PhD position (2016) open
to study the change of RNA structure motifs in response to stress. Dr. Ding is involved in this PhD
program as co-supervisor. Both labs are currently looking for the global structural and biophysical
features of RNA from high throughput deep sequencing data.
4) Dr. Yiliang Ding's lab has developed a novel and powerful platform, Structure-seq, to study RNA
structure in vivo and across diverse species at the genome-wide scale. Her lab is currently
developing new in vivo genome-wide platforms to detect RNA-protein interactions and to
simultaneously improve in vivo RNA structure prediction.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>UK-US platform for the study of RNA structure in living cells</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Purdue University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>UK-US platform collaborator</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6826E53-65C9-42E9-9DEF-6487546FAF8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 1st Workshop Program UK-US platform for the study of RNA structure in living cells was from 8th Aug to 10th Aug 2016.
