The bug that causes malaria is transmitted to human following the bite of a mosquito infected with Plasmodium parasites. There are different species (types) of Plasmodium parasites including falciparum, vivax, malariae, ovale, etc, but the one causing most of the malaria cases in endemic regions of Africa and elsewhere in the tropic is Plasmodium falciparum which accounts for millions of deaths every year with the greater majority of those affected being children under five.|It has been suggested that innate immunity plays a crucial role in protecting humans from being invaded by malaria parasites soon after infection thereby allowing some people to clear the bugs from their system without coming down with adverse manifestations (symptoms).|In this study, we plan to study the role that some genes belonging to the innate arm of the immune system play in susceptibility to malaria severity. Notably, we want to look at the involvement of KIR and HLA genes in the development of complications following infection with Plasmodium falciparum.|We use DNA samples collected from 321 infants infected with Plasmodium falciparum and 315 population control samples to type for KIR and HLA by highly sensitive molecular techniques (PCR-SSP and sequence-based typing). In the infected group, we have a sub-group of children that did not develop any complication following their malaria encounter but there were a second sub-group of children that suffered severe complications resulting from their being infected with Plasmodium falciparum.|KIR data has been generated from these study participants and is currently being analysed while HLA class I typing is still going on.|Comparative analysis will be done between groups to determine the role played either individually or collectively by these KIR and HLA class I genes in the susceptibility to severe malaria.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Mortality resulting from malaria infection is very high in children under 5 years old in the developing world. Following infection with Plasmodium falciparum some people remain asymptomatic while others develop either mild or severe form of malaria. The reasons behind this diverse clinical presentation in malaria endemic regions are still not well understood but are thought to be influenced by both parasite and host genetic factors.|In this study, we aim to investigate the role of two highly polymorphic regions of the human genome (Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR)) in severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum.|KIR genotyping was done by PCR-SSP (Sequence specific priming) techniques while the HLA typing was performed by sequencing exons 2 and 3 of HLA class I loci on human chromosome 6.|KIR data has been generated from 321 malaria cases and 315 control subjects. Preliminary analyses suggest that inhibitory KIR genes are present in most samples (frequencies ranging from 87-100% except for 2DL2 (76%) and 2DL5 (59%)). The frequencies of activating KIR genes are significantly lower compared to their corresponding inhibitory counterparts ranging from 10 to 46% with KIR3DS1 being the lowest (10.2%).|HLA typing is in progress. Association of individual KIR genes with disease severity is currently being analysed. HLA-KIR interactions in modulating the outcome of infection will be explored.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>408773</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E291E99-9733-438C-BE0F-68B20BDA1F55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in The Gambia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tissue antigens</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bff4ee4ff81e130304b8d75404a55387"><gtr:id>bff4ee4ff81e130304b8d75404a55387</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yindom LM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-2815</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15155_25_22220719</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190097133</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
