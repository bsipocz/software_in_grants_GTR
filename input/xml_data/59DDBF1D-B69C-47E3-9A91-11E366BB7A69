The sounds created by these phenomena have captivated novelists including Vladimir Nabokov and Thomas Hardy; composers including Henry Cowell and Frederic Chopin; and poets Percy Byshe Shelley in his 'Ode to the Western Wind' and Samuel Taylor Coleridge: \n\n\n'Not to love all things in a world so fill'd; \nWhere the breeze warbles, and the mute still air \nIs Music slumbering on her instrument.'\n\n[from The Aeolian Harp; Samuel Taylor Coleridge; 1795]\n\n\nLa Monte Young was fascinated by the sound of the wind through the Telegraph Wires near his home in Bern, Idaho, and later asserted that the harmonies created by these wires became an essential element in his work. Henry David Thoreau observed similar phenomena as the Telegraph Wires near his home were activated by the wind: 'The telegraph harp sounds strongly to-day, in the midst of the rain. I put my ears to the trees and I hear it working terribly within... the sound seems to proceed from the wood. It is as if you had entered some world-famous cathedral, resounding to some vast organ... The wire vibrates with great power, as if it would strain and rend the wood.' [Henry David Thoreau: Journals: 23 September 1851]\n\nAs Aeolian Phenomena have become a part of our Sonic and Literary Culture, so instrument makers from Asia, Europe and north America have sought to harness and shape these phenomena in the creation of Aeolian instruments including Bows, Harps, and Flutes. Aeolian Sound will bring the Sonic, Cultural and Natural history of Aeolian devices and phenomena together; and will use the knowledge gained through this process to inform the creation of new Aeolian devices. At a time when the behaviour of our natural environment is of such grave concern the harnessing of natural forces to create extraordinary Sonic Phenomena seems particularly apposite. \n\nThe key objective of Aeolian Sound is to energise debate regarding Aeolian Phenomena; their Cultural, Natural, and Sonic Histories; and their presence in Contemporary Sound Art practices. Further objectives include:\n\n1. The examination; documentation; and activation; of the Natural History of Aeolian Phenomena.\n2. The collation and documentation of materials both texts and recordings relating to the invention of Aeolian devices including Aeolian Bows, Flutes, Tiles, and Harps. \n3. To examine the impact Aeolian Sounds and Phenomena have had on Sonic and Literary Culture. \n4. To create, test and install a series of experimental Aeolian devices in both rural and urban environments. \n\nAeolian Sound will explore these objectives through the creation of installation, performance, text and online outputs including:\n\na. A series of newly constructed Aeolian devices to take up temporary and permanent positions in rural and urban environments. \nb. Multi-media publication to include transcriptions of Aeolian phenomena; audio recordings; video documentation; and texts discussing the Natural, Cultural and Industrial histories of Aeolian devices; and the impact of Natural Aeolian Phenomena on the creation of contemporary Aeolian devices within the context of Sound Art.\nc. Peer-Reviewed Journal Article charting the impact of Aeolian phenomena on Sonic and Literary Culture.\nd. Curated performance of a series of Aeolian transcriptions developed in collaboration with composers, improvising ensembles, and artists; with an accompanying symposium.\ne. A Website that will both chart the progress of the project and serve as an archive for images; sound-recordings; video; transcriptions and textual responses to the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Aeolian Sound will produce a comprehensive series of publicly accessible outputs including internet resources, printed media, audio and video documentation, performances, and both permanent and temporary installations. These will be disseminated in collaboration with high-quality cultural organisations including: The Eden Project; Sound and Music; Oxford Contemporary Music (OCM); and ResonanceFM. Further public dissemination is proposed through Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (HCMF); Ultima festival (Oslo); and Gaudeamus (Amsterdam).\n\nMax Eastley (ME) is a ground-breaking and influential Sound Artist. His work has attracted interest from the Sound Art and Popular Music Communities and is able to cross disciplinary and genre boundaries. His particular profile and the extent of his research interests will assist in the delivery of Impact.\n\nME and the Host Organisation (HO) will draw upon and share their existing contacts to maximize impact. The proposal therefore builds upon existing links with key collaborators including The Eden Project; SAM; OCM; Gaudeamus; ResonanceFM; and HCMF. The scale of the project will be the key development in these existing and in the case of The Eden Project the permanent installation will leave an abiding legacy of the research. The sharing of these contacts will create a new network in some cases providing fruitful linkage between the territories of Sound Art and Contemporary Composition. \n\nThe roles and responsibilities in relation to the impact of AS are clearly defined. ME and the HO will be responsible for the development and management of the proposed dissemination strategies and for maximizing their potential Impact value. The collaborating producers and organizations will be responsible for the promotion of the agreed activities. Each organization has appropriate systems; networks of contacts; and profile to effectively promote the dissemination plans. The relationships with OCM; SAM; The Eden Project; Oxford University Botanic Gardens &amp;amp; Harcourt Arboretum; Gaudeamus; HCMF; and ResonanceFM are well established. Both ME and researchers within SARU at the HO have ongoing relationships with these organizations that will facilitate the successful completion of the Impact activities proposed. The relationship with Ultima Festival is newly formed with meetings planned to take place in Spring 2010. \n \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240494</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Max Eastley and Aleks Kolkowski performed with a variety of Aeolian devices using artificial wind sources that produced wind by mechanical means.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C3E1635C-53A8-452C-9A13-067C71CB6FA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The evening was attended by over 800 people many of whom were very intrigued by this performance and stayed to ask many questions afterwards.

They were asked to respond to notions of broadcasting and communication and to a series of ideas. The station was active for 1 week. 

Max Eastley installed four Aeolian harps on the Aerial of the Radio Station. The sounds produced by the wind on the harps were transmitted to the control room and broadcast from 12Midday to 6pm each day. At 6pm other Artists' broadcasts began. It became evident from the evening broadcasts that the installation could also be heard acoustically as the radio station building acted as a resonator for the installation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BDFB430-2116-474B-A5D8-32C2D15455A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the first time that live sound was broadcast through internet radio from an Aeolian installation for an extended period of time. Max Eastley was able to get the daily wind forecast for Writtle and then go and listen to the sounds that were produced by the installation as a result of the particular wind speeds, forces and direction on that day. He was able to monitor and learn about the kind of reactions to expect from the installation in a given wind and of changes to the sounds that occurred according to the different tensioning of strings in the installation itself.

Both public listeners and other broadcasters commented on having a heightened awareness of the actual time and place of the radio station and its broadcasts due to being able to monitor the wind conditions through the music produced by the wind from the installation.

Max Eastley realised the technical possibilities of having a permanent or semi-permanent installation that could be linked with a website or radio station. He is hoping to develop this at some future time.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cdf820cb7a5.46460226</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Writtle Calling (Temporary Radio Station).</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.writtlecalling.co.uk/writtleCalling_arc.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Max Eastley installed an Aeolian device at South Hill Park Arts Centre in Bracknell.

It is a decommissioned water reservoir constructed with four circular walls inside and with an external tower rising above the central section. On the outside, the main body of the building forms a public park of grass and the central tower rises above this.

The resonance inside the buildings was extraordinary: the outer ring of the interior space had a reverberation time of 16 seconds.

Max Eastley erected eight Aeolian Harps on the top of the external faces of the central tower. The sound from these was transmitted, using techniques developed from his previous researches (as detailed in other entries) and projected into the interior of the building. Inside the building Max installed ten acoustic sculptures. The sounds of the Aeolian harps and the acoustic sculptures were combined to create an aural architectural space that led visitors through the physical architecture to discover the interior sculptures.

The exhibition lasted for three months.

It was acknowledged by many visitors as a Gesamtkunstwerk. The installation attracted an average of 150 visitors per day composed of both art and music specialists, architects, designers and the public. The feedback from visitors was overwhelmingly positive and many spoke of being introduced to a world of sound that they previously had not experienced. The mixture of sounds within the environment that came from both outside and inside was constantly changing: it was different not just from one day to the next but from moment to moment. It was notable that visitors often spent long periods in the environment and many made repeat visits. 

The Exhibition led to a number of subsequent invitations: an installation in Springhornhof in Germany, an appointment as City Sound Artist for Bonn; lectures for the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne and for Soundunder, Athens; installations in Riga, Latvia, and a number of future invitations. See separate entries.

A 3 Dimensional Virtual simulation of the space, accompanied by recordings made of the sounds of the installation was developed by architect and sound artist Guillermo Lares which was also exhibited, at Meinblau Gallery, Berlin and is now available on the internet:

The exhibition drew large audiences as the gallery, directed by Alex Sainsbury, is recognised as a major exhibitor of contemporary art and this exhibition introduced a mostly previously unaware public to Aeolian devices and their history as well as to the relationships that can be created between Aeolian phenomena and internal architecture. The exhibition also drew further publicity for Max Eastley and Aeolian devices through a performance, radio interview and broadcast of live Aeolian sound (see Other Outputs Category).

The nature of the tour and the work of all of the other six participants were inspired by his research and his work. The exhibition reached many thousands of people and provoked a great deal of discussion as the exhibition reached areas of the country where the ideas of Aeolian Phenomena that the exhibition encompassed were mostly completely unknown. There was a lot of discussion with members of the public about the nature of music and whether the phenomena of wind-produced sound is or can be perceived as music. Many people were astonished at the concept of sound and music produced by wind.

For the artists involved it was a great opportunity for all of them to develop their own work and researches into Aeolian Phenomena - work which is continuing. They also used the opportunity provided by touring to all of these different sites to explore knowledge of and dealing with different wind conditions: using anemometers, predicting local wind conditions and generally expanding their knowledge of forecasting and the effects of geography and meteorology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8040346426.926875a715f2cc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Audible Forces</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://audibleforces.blogspot.co.uk/p/home.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture at CRISAP, London College of Communication.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D15F76E8-2327-41BF-A708-30ABA376E0D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 20 attendees of the specialist interest area of sound art attended.

Max Eastley was invited to lecture to an audience of architects and sound artists on creating Aeolian Installations within architecture and the landscape and to do an accompanying performance. The audience was made up of approximately 75 Architects, sound artists and the general public. The talked sparked a great deal of interest, discussion and questions and Max performed on his instrument, the Arc, developed from an Aeolian harp.



He has been asked to lead a summer school, 'Aeolian Currents', to be held on one of the Greek Islands notable for wind, to take place in 2015.

He has produced a large number of creative outputs directly as a result of his researches, which, together with lectures, teaching and media interviews have reached a large International public. He continues to receive commissions in relation to these researches in the UK and abroad, so the impact continues.

Both in and outside the UK, projects have promoted the engagement of councils, public and government with the whole topic of wind forces, art works and environmental concerns. The context in which art works have been and will be presented have brought an awareness to both public, to media and to politicians that the wind is important, not just as an energy source for heat and light but also for other aspects of society. Funders continue to be willing to take installations and exhibitions seriously enough to finance them. The major concern of 'what if there's no wind?' has led funders, artists and public to awareness of and to think about the unpredictability of weather conditions, both local and national. In some places, the exhibition of aeolian installations has brought awareness of the effects on local conditions caused by buildings in the urban environment as well as land features and weather. In Salisbury, for example, the Cathedral reflects the prevailing Westerly wind to the East - a fact that the local planners and architects had not been aware of before. 

The reputation of English Education and research has undoubtedly been enhanced by Eastley's International work. He was the only representative of the UK in International conferences in Zurich, Latvia and Germany, has exhibited in many countries and has been awarded two residencies in Germany as well as being given many commissions there, thereby giving an enhanced view of the UK as fostering research in this field.

In academia, Max Eastley's researches have also fuelled debates about the nature of sound and music: when sound becomes music and music sound, which is very relevant to contemporary developments in music. His researches have also fuelled debate around the question of how Sound Art is defined: can it be totally invisible, i.e. only generated to the ears, or is an art object producing sound regarded also as a piece of art? What is the relationship between the visual and aural arts? 

The majority of the work done by Eastley has reached large numbers of the general public internationally and raised awareness of the topics of his research. The unusual contexts of a lot of his work - Installations in non-gallery spaces, in Botanical Gardens, Community Festivals, unusual architectural environments and on the radio and internet, have brought many people who would not have come across this otherwise, to both the art and to the debates. 

Max Eastley's work has been an inspiration to other artists and practitioners and the public. The continued demand for more work, conferences and teaching workshops demonstrates the interest that exists in this field. It is evident that the majority of the audiences Eastley reached had not considered the power or effects of the wind but are doing so now.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>590256D1-B54E-4096-A352-5CF2682F00AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54635d4f8be013.41281985</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In his research, Max Eastley found that, on the whole, people hadn't given much thought to the implications of Aeolian Phenomena in Music, Sound Art, Architecture and Environmental Planning. Audiences presented with Max Eastley's work and researches stated that they found many of the experiences revelatory. There were always questions and debates around his presentations such as: what is the nature of Sound Art; is there a border between Sound Art and Music, and if sound is produced without a musician or composer, can that be defined as Music? Max's performances as a musician with sound generated by Aeolian devices threw these questions into sharper perspective.

A way of bringing Aeolian sound into interior spaces and integrating those sounds with interior sculptures was another key finding. This began with his exhibition at the Raven Row Gallery where the relationship with the C18 architecture and history of the Aeolian harp were important elements. In the Wasserspeicher, Berlin, there was a vast change of scale. There the relationship was not primarily with history but with the interior and exterior visual and acoustic architecture of the building. The sounds of the Aeolian Harps projected into the building from the outside were blended with interior works that were constantly changing, and which, although not alive, exhibited some of the qualities of living organisms in the unpredictability of their relationships to each other. This work enabled visitors to become explorers moving through a place that was both exterior and interior in its nature. Some comments were that being there was like being in a garden where the events of are sometimes very tiny, sometimes very large but never repeated, so attention is always alert, attuned and listening is intense.

Max Eastley's work with technology enabled this change of scale in his work. Technology was used to carry live sound, either within architecture or through exterior spaces or through the internet and broadcast technology. Audiences were listening to real time and space and could, for instance, listen to Writtle radio on the internet anywhere in the world: to Aeolian devices operating in a distant place with totally different wind conditions.

Eastley gained knowledge of the wind and its behaviour: an Aural as well as a visual understanding of Wind phenomena. Other artists with whom he worked to create the touring exhibition, Audible Forces, were instrumental in introducing the public to the behaviour of the wind. It sometimes took time to persuade organisers of community Festivals to risk mounting an exhibition that depended on the unpredictable nature of wind, but experience gained by Eastley and the other artists meant that they were able to produce works that would operate in a wide range of wind forces and produce an equivalent variety of reactions. The public approached the exhibition as an unclassified series of artworks and gained an immediate understanding of the relationship of object to wind and of artist to object and that there could be many different approaches to the same brief.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Universities in the UK, particularly Oxford Brookes University, will draw more students to Sound Art and Music Courses. Universities outside of the UK are already asking for further lecturing by Max Eastley on the topics covered by his research.

New software has already been created to make Virtual environments modelled on Max Eastley's creations in this research.

Max Eastley and the other artists with whom he has worked have created bespoke electronics that may well have a variety of other uses as well as new technologies for working with the wind.

Architects and Town Planners have requested more input on the topics of Max Eastley's research and at least one summer school for this group of people is planned in Greece to explore Aeolian Phenomena further.

Research in museum collections has led to new information about and a re-definition of and re-evaluation of some of the Aeolian devices in their collections.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1AF5D494-EE2C-40BF-990C-738E7D36F1F7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54624882ee9c63.32163630</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://maxeastley.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>790711E0-A97B-4BF5-8EC1-5552FF91BB08</gtr:id><gtr:title>Two Measures of Time, a catalogue of the exhibition by Max Eastley and Martin Riches.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/af38dbcbcea897801fff893c24924af3"><gtr:id>af38dbcbcea897801fff893c24924af3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M Eastley</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58aee208974c47.42266189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H033408/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13304AD-8058-4333-86C7-DB798216A696</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
