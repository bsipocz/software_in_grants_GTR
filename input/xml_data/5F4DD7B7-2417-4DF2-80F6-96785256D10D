Surveys have also started adopting technologies including mobile devices for data collection. There is a big move in the direction of online data collection in the UK including the plan to collect 75% of household responses through the online mode of data collection in the UK 2021 Census. However, evidence is needed to demonstrate that an online data collection strategy will work in the UK. Unfortunately, so far not much is known about online data collection in the UK as the available datasets have small subsamples. This project addresses this gap and aims to analyse online response behaviour and data quality issues in the first available key ESRC large scale data resource as well as in another secondary data resource in the UK that are partially collected online with mobile devices as an available option for respondents - Understanding Society and Second Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE2). These data will contain large enough samples to conduct advanced statistical modelling to address this project's research questions. One of the ESRC current main priority areas for investment is 'ways of being in a digital age' and this project addresses issues which belong to this area of priority by studying respondents' choice of devices used during completion of online surveys and their online survey behaviour. 

Experience from other countries will be taken into account through the use of international advisors from the US and the Netherlands who will be part of the project's Advisory Committee. The project will also carry out some data analysis work in parallel with the Dutch partners from the Data Collection Innovation Centre. Results from the project will be compared to findings from the Netherlands to draw cross-country comparisons. 

The findings from our project will be instrumental in better understanding participants' choices of devices used and response behaviour in mixed-device online surveys in the UK and in particular in informing best practice for the next UK Census in 2021. The project will also extend understanding of the data quality issues related to online mode of data collection with a special focus on respondents' use of different devices including mobile devices during survey completion process. These findings will inform knowledge that will lead to improvements in online data collection and as a result of this in data quality in the UK and other countries. The results will improve the understanding of who does and who does not respond in online surveys and which groups of respondents choose different devices and hence will inform the efforts of survey practitioners to increase response rates and to reduce survey errors and costs. The project will directly benefit statistical survey agencies and survey practitioners from a wide range of sectors, including government and the public sector, the private and voluntary sector, and market research companies. It will also advise researchers on how best to incorporate different devices data into advanced statistical models. The project will provide recommendations to survey practice organisations on which data need to be collected in the future in order to assess data quality of large scale surveys more effectively.

The project team will work closely together with a range of statistical agencies and market research companies, both nationally and internationally, to ensure the benefits of this research for survey practice and direct impact of the project findings. 

Dissemination of the project findings will include peer-reviewed journal articles, presentations at seminars in the non-academic partner institutions and at national and international conferences as well as a short course and an international research symposium among other activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
We expect three groups to benefit from the research:
1. Academic researchers (social scientists, applied statisticians and survey researchers) and non-academic researchers (government researchers and survey researchers) with interest in the analysis of mixed-device online survey data. This group of users ranges from analysts who wish to learn about respondents' online survey behaviour to more advanced users who wish to consider the impacts of selection and data quality in online surveys on their substantive conclusions. 

2. Data collection agencies and survey practitioners from commercial companies, survey research and market research organisations, government entities involved in data collection, and academic or non-profit survey organisations.


3. Survey sponsors and policy-makers. This group includes principle investigators of research projects, programme managers within government agencies and third sector organisations who issue large scale data collection and are responsible for and/or reliant on the quality of the statistics produced from these surveys.

How will they benefit?

1. Group 1 will obtain insights into the respondents' online survey behaviour and mobile device use as well as into selection and data quality issues associated with the online data collection. The project will further build capacity in UK Social Statistics through a short course, an international research symposium and through further advancing the skill set of the PI. Therefore it will contribute to the ESRC's long-term strategy of enhancing the quantitative skills of UK social scientists and will complement activities of other ESRC investments such as the NCRM and the Quantitative Methods Initiative. The research will also raise international awareness of the UK Social Science and its online survey research.

2. Group 2 will benefit from this research through a better understanding of issues associated with the online survey data collection. The in-depth analysis of online surveys will help to improve quality of future online survey data and will potentially improve the efficiency of data collection and reduce its costs. The research will benefit survey practitioners who are interested in increased survey response rates and in reduction of nonresponse in online surveys. The research will also provide guidance for design decisions for new surveys and will inform survey practice organisations on which different device data need to be collected in the future in order to assess data quality of large-scale surveys more effectively. 

3. Group 3 often lacks the means to control the quality of survey data provided to them by data collection agencies. The policy-makers also draw on the Social Science research and are dependent on good quality of survey data. This group has to rely on a limited set of indicators (e.g., response rates) to evaluate the delivered product. This project will provide insights into the process of efficient online data collection and will allow outside control over the survey process. 

What will be done to ensure that they benefit?

The project team has a strong record of engaging with non-academic as well as academic survey researchers and social scientists from a wide range of backgrounds. We will promote impact with non-academic partners through their direct involvement.

The proposed research will achieve impact through the completion of high-quality research which will be disseminated through research papers in leading journals, a policy brief with the main findings, seminar and conference presentations, an international research symposium, a short course and other activities. Further details of our dissemination strategy are outlined in the Pathways to Impact document.

This research will feed into academic and survey practice debates on future mixed-device online survey data collection and mixed-mode data collection strategies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010172/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
