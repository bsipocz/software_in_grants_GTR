The events in question were hardly insignificant. They included the bubble of optimism inflated by the Solidarity movement in the Gdansk shipyard strikes and its puncturing by the period of martial law exacted by Poland's communist government - events that contributed, ultimately, to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the demise of the Soviet Union, and the reestablishment of a democratic Poland. Moreover, to some listeners, Lutoslawski's Symphony No. 3 sounds like a struggle to forge a melody capable of uniting an entire orchestra - a song of solidarity, as it were. Yet Lutoslawski had a one-word answer to this question: 'No.' 

Lutoslawski's 'no' represents a problem at the heart of almost all of the existing scholarship on the music of Poland's finest later 20th-century composer. Academics have steered clear of examining the complicated relationships between Lutoslawski's life and music, primarily because the composer denied any such connection and directed them elsewhere. Yet his music and activities - his wartime resistance anthems and caf&amp;eacute; performances, mass songs, film scores, folk-inspired 'light' music, popular songs and educational pieces - were all entwined with socio-political contexts. Even after his turn to the ostensible abstraction of modernism, his music's viscerally affecting evocations of tragedy, trauma, lament and transcendence suggest another story. Lutoslawski's writings, letters, sketches, work for musical institutions, religious beliefs and Solidarity activities add further nuance to the tale. 

This Early Career Fellowship project aims to tell this story and, in doing so, to transform perceptions of the relationships between Lutoslawski's life and work, revealing the full extent of his significance in the wake of a reppraisal of his legacy begun in 2013, his centenary. The Principle Investigator has united an international team of experts from the UK, Poland and USA to explore the project's key questions from diverse perspectives. He will lead a series of collaborations culminating in a major new essay collection analyzing the interrelationships between Lutoslawski compositions and their artistic, biographical, historical, political and social contexts, in order to generate revisionary understandings of the networks of meaning formed by the composer's life and works. The project will thereby reframe debates about music's roles during Poland's tumultuous 20th century and contribute to the investigation of topics including musical life between the wars, during the country's periods of Nazi and Soviet oppression, in the Cold War, and at the end of communism. 

In his individual research on the project, the PI will engage with perhaps the most controversial question about Lutoslawski's music: do the dramas of his compositions reflect the composer's real life experiences of trauma, violence and tragedy? Utilizing the interdisciplinary perspectives of trauma studies, and theories of musical affect, agency and embodiment, plus the expertise of the international team of scholars he has united to complete the project, the PI will address these vital issues about Lutoslawski's life and music through a series of essays designed to make a singular impact on the collaboration, while contributing significantly to wider spheres of critical endeavour relevant to contemporary musicology.

The extensive, well-attended and overwhelmingly positively received Lutoslawski celebrations in 2013 demonstrated that this project's findings would be of interest to a large worldwide audience. The PI will therefore engage in a wide range of activities to disseminate its findings to musicians, scholars, institutions, media providers, students and public audiences in the UK, Poland and elsewhere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has the potential to benefit three distinct groups beyond academia - the general public, broadcast and print media, and secondary-to-FE level students - through further development of the PI's links to media and arts organizations. Specific plans for impact activities (see 'Pathways to Impact' for more detail), many of which will reach more than one of the above beneficiary groups, thus include:

1. Public discussion at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 2016: Following an invitation by the Adam Mickiewicz Institute to contribute to debate panels at the Warsaw Autumn Festival, and utilizing his connections with the Polish Institute of Music and Dance, the PI intends to launch the edited collection arising from this project with a public event at the Festival. This will summarize the project's main findings and engage stakeholders including members of the public, music journalists and broadcasters, academics, students, musicians and arts administrators. 
 
2. UK and other European pre-concert talks in 2016-17: Utilizing contacts with the Adam Mickiewicz Institute, Polish Institute of Music and Dance, the Polish Cultural Institutes in London and in Brussels, plus various orchestras, the PI plans pre-concert talks and public lectures in the UK and Europe showcasing findings of the project. 

3. Screening, Concert and Q&amp;amp;A at Keele in 2015: A screening of films scored by Lutoslawski, a concert including his music and a public engagement Q&amp;amp;A will take place at Keele University during the project's collaborative workshop, as part of the Keele Arts public series. The events will be promoted to the Polish communities in Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe, and to local schools and sixth-form colleges with whom the PI has connections through his award-winning outreach work at Keele.

4. BBC Radio 3 and The Guardian: Radio 3's Music Matters has specifically requested that the PI contact them to discuss his forthcoming books on Lutoslawski, plus any other items of potential interest to the station's listeners. The PI will also propose articles arising from the project to The Guardian, for whom he has written already, and from whose editors he has an open invitation to pitch further articles. 

5. Orchestral Education projects: The PI has long-standing links with two major London orchestras committed to twentieth-century music and education, the Philharmonia and London Sinfonietta, and with arts administrators in venues including the Royal Festival Hall and Kings Place. He plans to work with their education teams on projects developing the Fellowship's findings for general audiences and students. 

6. It is reasonable to predict that, building on the PI's demonstrable commitment to the development of strategies enhancing the direct impact of research in the arts and humanities on beneficiaries beyond academia (see 'Summary CV'), further impact activities will arise from invitations for the PI to give pre-concert talks, to write articles for programme books, brochures and websites, and to make additional broadcast appearances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50994</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Lutoslawski and Trauma'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE601C28-1EED-4AB1-A41E-9A6B424B3A5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research seminar open to public given at University of Sheffield on 7 December 2015.

i) Under the leadership of the award's PI, Nicholas Reyland, an international team of scholars is producing Lutoslawski's Worlds (under contract with Boydell &amp;amp; Brewer, publication due summer 2017), a landmark volume in the study of Witold Lutoslawski, one of the twentieth century's most important composers and Poland's finest composer since Chopin and Szymanowski. Uniting all of the world's finest Lutoslawski scholars, the collection represents a paradigmatic shift in approach to the study of his music. Throughout his life, the composer steered musicologists away from the connections between his extraordinary biography and equally extraordinary concert music. Moreover, he sought to minimize scholarly attention to the many other spheres of creative activity - popular music, theatre music, film scoring, propaganda music, educational music, and so on - that occupied him during his lifetime. In Lutoslawski's Worlds, scholars consider for the first time the full range of Lutoslawski's musical output and, equally importantly, the biographical, cultural and historical contexts in which those musics were created. Lutoslawski himself spoke of two worlds: the ideal world of his imagination and the real world of everything else. He sought to keep the real world from impinging too much on his ideal world, and later tried to shape the discourses around his music to reflect that personal desire. This volume contends that all of Lutoslawski's worlds are equally worthy of study, because each represents an opportunity better to understand the life and music of a figure of paramount importance to the critical and cultural history of twentieth-century music. Contributors to Lutoslawski's Worlds gathered at Keele University in March 2015 to share and interrogate their work-in-progress on topics including Lutoslawski and war, loss, trauma, melancholia, popular music, socialist realism, film, the construction of genius, the politics of coalition, correspondence, commemoration, diaries, philosophy, and modernism. These topics are key themes of the chapters in Lutoslawski's Worlds. 

ii) The collaborative strand of the project, represented by the workshop and essay collection, represents a large-scale international endeavour that has significantly developed the PI's leadership capacity. It enabled the PI to inspire and mentor scholars including early-career researchers from Poland and the US, and to advance his experience of managing the challenge of fostering productive and supportive intellectual dialogues across national and disciplinary boundaries, and between scholars at different stages of their careers. In this vein, the has also mentored Dr Lisa Jakelski, a career young colleague from the US, in her co-editing of the essay collection Lutoslawski's Worlds with the PI.

As well as co-editing Lutoslawski's Worlds and co-writing its introduction, Nicholas Reyland, the award's PI, contributes a chapter to the collection entitled 'Lutoslawski's Music of Mourning: Personal Loss, Cultural Grief, and the Meanings of Muzyka zalobna'. This is the first of three essays by the PI marking the other most significant achievements of the award. Reyland's research has revealed the startling extent to which the first half of Lutoslawski's life - the period up to the composition of Muzyka zalobna ('Mourning Music', 1954-58) - was darkened by traumatic bereavements and absences. From infancy to creative maturity, Lutoslawski was repeatedly afflicted by personal and cultural losses, many of which were extreme even in a Polish context. Yet the composer always preferred to direct attention away from the potential interconnectedness of his life and art, and despite, for instance, his music's many significations of lamentation and violence from Muzyka zalobna onwards. 

Reyland's Lutoslawski's Worlds chapter documents the bereavements and absences that had scarred the composer's psyche by 1954, and the musical and non-musical traces of his responses to those losses. It then proposes a reading of Muzyka zalobna that explores the relationship between the expressive potential of the composition's musical plot and contemporary theories of grief-work, i.e., the mourning process. The composition progresses from a lamenting prologue into metamorphoses liberating the music's intimations of agency from all-consuming grief; a violent reversal then wrenches the music into an intensified but fracturing revision of the earlier lament. This essay explores the parallels between the trajectories of the music's sensuous and structural oscillations and the oscillating patterns of grief. In conclusion, it then considers the extent to which rethinking Muzyka zalobna places Lutoslawski at the head of the lineage of Polish composers (including G&amp;oacute;recki, Panufnik and Penderecki) whose music responded more explicitly to personal and cultural trauma during Poland's twentieth century. 

The second and third essays (under preparation for submission in 2016 to peer-review journals) develop Reyland's work on Lutoslawski, trauma and loss in an innovative direction. His research is challenging dominant conceptions of the relationship between artistic activity and trauma by drawing on important new research in psychology and cognitive science. While exploring the extent to which images of trauma and loss, anger and lament, continue to be represented by Lutoslawski's music after Muzyka zalobna, overall the three essays chart move away from traditional notions of the traumatized artist to a new perspective focused on resilience and post-traumatic growth - concepts which more fully explain the striking disparity between, on the one hand, Lutoslawski's horrifying life experiences and the representation of similar horrors in his music and, on the other hand, the fact that the composer appears, to all intents and purposes, not only to have survived multiple traumatic events but, in fact, to have thrived in their wake. As well as offering an unexpected twist to Lutoslawksi criticism and biography, the work offers a potential template for revised perspectives on artistic production, grief and trauma applicable far beyond the realms of Lutoslawski studies and musicology.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The projects findings will be primarily taken forward and put to use by the large international community of musicologists working on Lutoslawski, Polish and central/eastern European music, and twentieth-century western art music. However, the project's findings will have a considerably wider range of academic beneficiaries both within and beyond music studies. Because of its musical focus, the project's main disciplinary beneficiaries will be analysts, critics, historians and theorists working within specialist Music departments. However, the project's reframing of Lutoslawski's life and music in contexts including trauma studies and the Cold War will engage music scholars beyond specialists in Polish music, music in central/eastern Europe, and music since 1900. Musicologists working on twentieth-century social and political history, the World Wars, the Cold War and Communism, will find the project's findings valuable. Specific beneficiaries outside Music departments include historians, literary scholars, film specialists and other academics working on Polish cultural history, World Wars I and II, the Cold War, Soviet communism and post-communism, and a wide range of 20th-century arts. The PI's innovative research on trauma, grief, resilience and post-traumatic growth will be of interest to scholars of conflict, trauma and grief studies working from a range of backgrounds, such as psychologists, cognitive scientists, and cultural theorists.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35275E54-4818-46B7-A483-3A06132036B6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d57537de8e26.88902769</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L014831/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8F220D14-A48F-413D-9D9E-0756C51CE2B0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
