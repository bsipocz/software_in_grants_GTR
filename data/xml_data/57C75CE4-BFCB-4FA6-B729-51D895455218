Achieving this will mean confronting two longstanding and deeply embedded contributors to such emissions: the poor energy efficiency standards of many UK buildings and our dependence on fossil fuels for heating. 
Despite the fact that almost half of the energy we use in the UK is for heating, the problems of how to make major reductions in demand, and to decarbonise supply to meet remaining needs, have received limited attention. In addition, the evidence is that more radical forms of energy efficiency and heat innovations are happening more slowly than has often been assumed. There are significant uncertainties about the best ways to increase the pace of change in relation to better insulation of buildings, energy sources, technologies and prices. There are also contentious questions about shares of costs and benefits. Our social science research will address these uncertainties and contribute new insights into innovation for energy efficient and sustainable heat in Europe. 
Although the UK is not alone in confronting these challenges, UK patterns of energy efficiency and heating for buildings are significantly different from many other European countries, reflecting the UK's history of cheap and plentiful natural gas resources, and the low priority given to energy efficiency and the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Other parts of Europe have different histories, and have established policies, technologies and businesses oriented to efficiency and low carbon supplies. There are opportunities for the UK to benefit from such experience. We will compare UK, Danish and German responses to concurrent economic and environmental challenges, and the role of cities in emerging solutions in each case. We will study particular cities in England, Scotland, Germany and Denmark to identify and analyse differences in energy performance of buildings, heating systems, and energy policy and market structures. Findings will be used to provide insight into feasible and effective ways forward for UK energy efficiency and sustainable heat policy.
Rather than narrow (and potentially misleading) technical and economic assessments, our research focuses on explaining the differences between societies in patterns of energy efficiency and demand for heating. We pay particular attention to urban settings, because this is where heat demand is concentrated and where many resources for innovation are located, but we also consider the interaction of city, national and European scales. 
Our research aims are threefold: 
First, to develop a new analysis of innovations in energy efficiency and sustainable heat by drawing on two related strands of social science research on innovation: social studies of the technical infrastructures and social studies of the markets which underpin energy demand and supply, and which structure the pace and shape of change.
Second, to develop detailed evidence about emerging innovations for energy efficiency and sustainable heat in selected UK and European cities, and to analyse the implications of these innovations for urban energy demand to 2050.
Third, to use our research to identify the potential, and means, for shared learning between European cities, in relation to energy efficiency and sustainable heat policy and practice. We will do this by working closely with UK and European policymakers, businesses and communities.
The research has been designed in interaction with policy-makers, urban authorities and energy practitioners, as well as senior researchers. We will engage across European policy and research networks, and with stakeholders in each city case study. We will disseminate our research through presentations to a wide variety of UK and international audiences with interest in the future of heating systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Intended beneficiaries 
Heating and energy services' suppliers; urban and regional authorities, Scottish, UK and EU policy-makers; energy-related knowledge exchange networks such as UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Energy Technologies Institute (ETI); End Use Energy Demand Centres (EUED), particularly the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED). 
2. User engagement:
The project will be managed in collaboration with beneficiaries. In comparing energy efficiency and heat services, and innovation, in UK, Denmark and Germany, particularly through urban case studies, the research will have an impact on shared learning. We will seek to make constructive use of this through engagement with the EU IEE STRATEGO network, which has 23 learning regions/cities, and 8 experienced regions/cities. Meetings of our cross-sector Advisory Board will be used to identify additional knowledge exchange priorities. Engagement will contribute to:
a. comparative European scenarios for energy efficiency and decarbonisation of heat; 
b. developing feasible business and financial models;
c. shared learning for best practice in governance of such innovation in urban settings;
d. evaluation of feasibility of different urban scale transition pathways.
3. What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit?
The research has been devised in interaction with UK and Scottish policy-makers, urban authority officers and energy practitioners, as well as Co-Directors of CIED. Our cross sector Project Advisory Board, including CIED (Geels), will meet twice a year to provide feedback and support wider dissemination. We will provide evidence-based feedback, and opportunities for reflection on progress for policy-makers, at European network and sustainable heat project planning meetings, particularly in Birmingham and Glasgow, and via Scottish Cities Alliance and Government Heat Network Partnership, and IEE STRATEGO. We will make formal presentations of evidence to policy-making bodies - notably the UK DECC Heat Team and Scottish Heat Networks Partnership. We aim to present findings to additional European networks with responsibility for energy efficient and low carbon heat policy, via Scotland Europa and Euroheat and Power. Wider knowledge exchange will be addressed by engagement in End Use Energy Demand centre events, especially CIED, where we aim to collaborate with the Low Energy Innovation Studio. We will link with UKERC national energy scenario workshops. A final one day conference will bring together key urban authorities, policy-makers, businesses and researchers. In relation to other practitioner and public research users, we will produce short articles for social media using the University of Edinburgh Press Office, as well as our networks into industry associations and Scottish and UK parliaments. The project website will be used to disseminate findings via early access to working papers. We will send regular updates to the End Use Energy Demand Centres, and to newsletters from the Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation newsletter (ISSTI University of Edinburgh), European Economic Sociology and Sustainability Transitions Research Network, to reach a broad energy-related academic and user community. We will present evidence at meetings and inquiries organised by Parliamentary Committees and forums in Westminster and Edinburgh. 
4. Capability
The project will draw on the international resources of the University of Edinburgh, including the Institute of Governance (IoG), Science, Technology and Innovation Studies, and the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation which hosts the Government's Climate Policy Exchange. Interaction between this hub and the Institute for Energy Systems (Edinburgh College of Science and Engineering) is ensured by team membership. All team members work at the interface of research, policy and action, and bridge intersecting communities of interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>580962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Government</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Scottish Government Working Group District Heating Regulation</gtr:description><gtr:id>69F2FD83-9D73-437B-A53D-7B2156878AF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2015 and 2016 Reports on Regulatory Options for District Heating in Scotland</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b20f983f28b5.19737359-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Information about heat and energy efficiency policy formation</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Advice on European comparative regulatory frameworks for district heating</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Energy Systems Catapult Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Energy Systems Catapult 'Smart Systems and Heat' Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB8D6702-965B-483D-9A7F-00855B266DD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Planning for future research on low carbon heat and whole energy systems</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d70d3fd5f0.72754328-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Information on research and programme development for low carbon heat in buildings</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>1.

Aimed largely at leading-edge local authorities working on heat network issues, the workshop provided the opportunity to exchange best practice in the current budget/policy environment and to input into national heat network priorities around the 300 million GBP capital expenditure announced in the Government's November 2015 Spending Review.

Keynotes and panel sessions with experts from government, industry and academia focussed on the following topics:

 role of local action in national and international efforts to decarbonize heat
 relevant lessons from international experience with heat networks
 the evolving landscape: stakeholders, benefits and latest developments
 commericial viability and UK heat networks?
 outcomes of early stage funding and business models for delivery or how to get heat networks funded and retain the multiple benefits communities are seeking
 filling the gaps: capacity and resource needs and next steps, including the identification of responsibilities and problem owners

Attendees of this event had an unprecedented opportunity to examine the current state-of-play in the UK and influence future developments for heat networks. Expert practitioners took a hard look at UK prospects in an international context with comparitive lessons from Germany, the Netherlands and further afield.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d3a6357a42.14236971</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/events/heat-networks-governance-issues.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EU IEE Stratego (national heat and cooling plans) Network event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D75C652B-9802-4211-98D8-F7523581EB19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>international capacity building bringing representatives of the Hamburg government and citizens' initiative (which resulted in re-municipalisation of the energy grids) together with Scottish city authorities at our 2016 Heat Network Partnership workshop, hosted by Falkirk Council.

The policy roundtable is part of a series of conversations being led by Scottish Labour to support our work in opposition and manifesto development for 2016. We would appreciate your thought and analysis on challenges for Scotland, good practice to promote and innovative solutions to key problems.

Below are questions we will be posing, in advance for you to gather your thoughts.

&amp;middot;How do we capture the jobs, community and climate opportunities from community schemes?

&amp;middot;How do we promote more Community and Cooperative energy schemes?

&amp;middot;How do we get our local authorities to engage in the concept of ESCOS and make the most of the opportunities offered by solar, wind and CHP schemes?

&amp;middot;What have been the lessons from Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow Council's efforts to promote renewables?

&amp;middot;What has been the particular role of housing associations and how can it be developed?

&amp;middot;What are the new community options in relation to local storage for energy and heat?

&amp;middot;What's the role of the planning system in delivering the right policy framework for community heat?

&amp;middot;What is the starting point for a national infrastructure project for energy efficiency?

&amp;middot;Are the solutions different for urban and rural communities and householders?

&amp;middot;What are the different challenges posed by building type and ownership that we need to overcome?

&amp;middot;What is the role - if any for the big power companies?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c6f375b2b9.44701513</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UKERC Heat Networks and Governance (Chairing panel on &quot;Domestic Experiences on the Leading Edge&quot;)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C529D326-B46B-427B-A0AF-6B8D223D7BB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event took place on April 11 &amp;amp; 12, 2016.

The Research and Pathways to Impact
'Reframing Energy Demand' addresses a central problem for energy policy across Europe: decarbonising heat and upgrading the energy efficiency of every building. Our research is based on comparative analysis of policy and practice in real time in Denmark, Germany and UK. The most valuable impacts from our findings are expected to stem from shared lessons for policy makers and practitioners about comparative European policy measures, their rationales and trajectories.
As the myriad challenges in decarbonising heat come into sharper focus we are in a strong position to inform and shape debates about the institutional reforms, planning and regulatory frameworks required to move beyond hitherto piecemeal impacts on the energy performance of buildings and marginal changes in the fuels used for heating.
Our intended impact has multiple pathways. First we regard policy-makers as our most significant constituents. This is particularly the case for UK and Scottish Government heat and energy efficiency policies, and associated powers and resources afforded to city authorities engaged in policy negotiation, implementation and review. Second the suppliers of low carbon heat systems are expected to benefit from evidence about comparative business structures and investment, and lastly there are benefits for the extensive capacity building networks of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), and the cross-sector Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) and Energy Systems Catapult.
The research was designed to engage with each of these sectors and networks as fieldwork progresses and findings emerge. Our research objectives and programme of work were developed from the outset through interaction with policy-makers and practitioners, as well as Co-Directors of the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED). This has worked effectively, already leading to invitations from: UK governments and their advisers to inform policy developments; trade associations to address conferences, or convene discussions; and energy research centres and industry-facing institutes to present early findings to their cross-sector networks. We have had formal and informal meetings with: Scottish and UK Governments (UK Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS; formerly DECC) and Scottish Business, Innovation and Energy Directorates); local authorities; ETI; Energy Systems Catapult; Energy Savings Trust; Scotland Europa (Brussels); the UK Association for Decentralised Energy (formerly Combined Heat and Power Association); the Danish Board of District Heating and Euroheat and Power (Brussels). 
At this interim stage of the research we are studying heat and energy efficiency initiatives of the municipal governments of Birmingham, Glasgow, Hamburg and Aalborg. We expect these findings to support city governments in developing and implementing low carbon heat strategies. 
In the longer term, we expect the research to contribute to new analytic insight into the effectiveness of different policy instruments for innovation in sustainable heat and low energy buildings. 
2. Impact Highlights 
For specific impacts see detailed section &amp;quot;Influence on Policy, Practice, Patients and the Public&amp;quot;. Highlights are summarised below.
Our European comparative analysis is making a significant contribution to UK and Scottish Government policies for Local Heat &amp;amp; Energy Efficiency Strategies and District Heating Networks.
? At UK level, the research is shaping the 2017 Government Emissions Reduction plan which will set out how the Government intends to meet post-2020 targets, including the agreed Fifth Carbon Budget. This impact stems from Prof Webb's advice to the UK Committee on Climate Change and ensuing work. 
? At Scottish level, the distinctive value of our comparative analysis of European district heating (DH) systems, regulated markets and the role of municipal authorities has had particular recognition and is leading to corresponding impact. 
In relation to Regulation of District Heating (DH), our findings show that a regulatory framework, adapted to the specific energy market and its infrastructures, is a supportive means both to investment and to consumer protection. Presentations of findings to Scottish Government and its advisers (Scottish Futures Trust, Resource Efficient Scotland and Scottish Enterprise) led to the invitation to advise Government on options for regulation of district heating, ultimately leading to current Government consultation documents on proposals for Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategies and DH regulation. 
? By working interactively with both Scottish and UK governments we are amplifying the impact of our findings on Local Heat &amp;amp; Energy Efficiency Strategies. Our research evidence demonstrates that statutory local government powers to plan heat and energy efficiency systems are a key factor in improving the coherence of low carbon, low energy retrofit and securing investment for new developments. At UK and Scottish level, in current market arrangements, the UK risks stalling on energy efficiency improvements to the building stock, and unintentionally promoting an unnecessarily costly patchwork of incompatible heating systems, with limited carbon savings. Returns to private finance from low carbon heat infrastructures are frequently assessed as too low, or too risky, to merit investment, but local governments lack capacity to act systematically on heat and energy efficiency infrastructures at urban scale; hence market development remains fragmented. Evidence about the effectiveness of local heat and energy efficiency planning can however be challenging for UK policymakers, given the continuing political commitment to coordination via markets. We are nevertheless making a significant contribution to policy development in Scotland, where consultation on Local Heat and Energy Efficiency Strategy is currently live. The Scottish strategy has been informed by our findings through advice to the cross-sector Heat Network Partnership, DH Expert Commission and its Working Groups on Regulation. The policy and regulatory developments in Scotland are in turn beginning to influence thinking within UK Government, through invitations to Prof Webb and Dr Hawkey to advise on heat and energy efficiency policy in a number of spheres as detailed in the Influence on Policy Section.
UK adoption of low carbon heat and energy efficiency planning, and potential district heating regulation, will stimulate significant change across the whole energy system. As such there will be extensive consultations and engagement with numerous partners, as well as policy experimentation. The eventual outcome of such processes will not be attributable to any single organisation, research group or specific sector. However, we expect our research to continue to make a significant contribution to policy formation and implementation, with on-going impact. 
At European level, our findings are contributing to capacity building by, for example, extending UKERC scenario workshops and future research, where the role of sustainable heat has been underdeveloped to date. Prof Webb gave the plenary address on the commercial potential of heat networks at the UKERC 2016 international workshop on Heat Networks and Governance. Our research has also resulted in international capacity building by bringing representatives of the Hamburg government and citizens' initiative (which resulted in re-municipalisation of the energy grids) together with Scottish city authorities at our 2016 Heat Network Partnership workshop, hosted by Falkirk Council. Delegates discussed innovation in low carbon heat in German and Scottish contexts. We have also presented evidence at meetings and inquiries organised by European city networks.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7A656E96-F429-4A54-B3C2-79FEC6C7CBD2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56b21373a9eb71.82433881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Findings are still at an early stage. What follows is a brief description of some emerging themes.
1. The 'problem' of low carbon heat and low energy buildings is framed in different ways in each of our comparator European states: Denmark, Germany and UK, depending on the 20th century history of building standards and heat provision and current co-evolution of policy and legacy energy network and building infrastructures. 
? Timing of construction and of increasing energy efficiency standards mean all three countries have significant potential across building stock to reduce final energy demand for heat. Construction standards in the UK have lagged European comparators but given the age of the stocks this is a relatively minor effect. All three countries have large proportion of buildings whose efficiency could be improved. 
? Distinctive energy governance institutions and regulations have co-evolved with particular heat supply infrastructures. For example, Danish energy taxes developed with the deployment of district heating (DH) from combined heat and power generation (CHP) and reflect a symbiotic relationship between central and municipal government; UK nationalised industries operated as autonomous corporations (with on-going controversy over the opportunity cost of their use of capital) with limited integration/coordination and exclusion of local government; German stadtwerke contributed both symbolically and financially to municipal self determination, and their resurrection resonates with these values. These differences, along with resource endowments, account for different socio-technical configurations of energy supply for heating, and distinctive future strategies for low carbon buildings, in the three countries.
? Fuel poverty is defined as a specific object of policy only in the UK, and not in Denmark or Germany where low incomes and difficulty paying bills are dealt with through social transfers. The particularities of UK fuel poverty policy are partly a result of the formal separation between the privatised energy industry and democratic government. In addition, the UK fuel poverty policy focus has increasingly moved from energy price per se to measures for improved home energy efficiency as a means to reduce household bills. Hence Energy Company Obligation funding is increasingly targeted on those defined as fuel poor.
? The low carbon heat option space in high level energy systems' scenarios differs between countries. In particular, Danish and German rejection of both nuclear and CCS lead to (a) a relatively narrow range of options for decarbonising heat for buildings (b) a stronger emphasis on energy efficiency than in the UK. In addition there is differentiation between UK countries: Scottish policy is opposed to new nuclear power, but conversion of the gas grid to hydrogen, using steam methane reforming with CCS, is regarded as an option. UK Government policy is pro-nuclear, but funding for CCS demonstration projects has been withdrawn.
Accelerating progress in urban low carbon and low energy heat infrastructure is proving difficult to effect in all three European states. The absence of a pressing infrastructural crisis, which worked historically to drive transformation, means that appetite for major overhaul [and the implied disruption to millions of building occupants and owners] is limited both in city and national governments. Denmark has retained institutional capacity for energy planning, but the focus is on incremental expansion of existing networks; Germany sees high potential in transforming energy inputs to DH networks, but there is disagreement about intensifying usage of the existing networks, as opposed to shifting to smaller scale community-owned heat systems; in the UK there are high levels of uncertainty about the future of heat and energy efficiency policies, and the role of technologies such as district heating. The absence of a governance structure for decisions about the future of the methane gas grid is significant in stalling other investment decisions.
? There are similar initiatives across countries to stimulate new markets in low carbon heat and energy efficiency in buildings. These include moves to: link energy efficiency to house prices; subsidise renewable heat generation and heat infrastructure; construct advice and information portals. Progress is however slow, and generally regarded as insufficient to meet national low carbon and energy saving targets for buildings.
? The use of economic metrics to justify specific policy design differs between countries: 
o Renewable heat: UK policy is tightly governed by a model of the economically rational consumer, and uses rule-based degression; the German subsidy system is tailored to achieve target outcomes on a trial-and-error basis.
o Energy efficiency standards in buildings: UK regulation is responsive to commercial interests; German regulation is derived from calculations designed to meet a 2050 net zero energy standard for buildings, assuming a high level of renewable energy for heating; Danish policy pushes standards beyond what is calculated as 'cost optimal' in economic terms.
? Rules governing economic calculation of cost optimal investments in each country respond to prior policy objectives, but are not determined by them. This is demonstrated in differential applications of cost-benefit analysis for energy efficiency and for district heating under EU Directive reporting.
? Policy objectives differ in their flexibility. For example, offsetting heat supply against fabric efficiency standards is regarded as legitimate in Germany and UK, but resisted in Denmark. 

2. Market frameworks and financial appraisal of sustainable heat innovations in UK, Danish and German cities
? All case study cities are working to establish capacities for action. UK cities are experimenting with municipally owned companies to build capacity. In Aalborg, the municipal approach is channelled through institutionalised structures of ownership (local) and appraisal (national). Hamburg re-municipalisation of heat network infrastructure is regarded as opening up routes to low carbon supply which multinational corporate ownership foreclosed.
? Transfer of DH networks to municipal ownership in both Hamburg and Aalborg are associated with debate about potential price rises associated with decarbonisation, though the case for transfer emphasised capacity to keep prices down. One of the key issues about relative prices concerns the counterfactual that is used, and the necessity for a low carbon comparator.
? Changes in European and national electricity markets are reshaping the local financial viability of investments in heat supply systems, particularly for combined heat and power.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Please see Narrative Impact and section on policy influence</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0BE88DD6-B190-4EB5-B326-A36EA9266612</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b21382a37425.19167213</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice to UK Government BEIS on development of criteria governing the first funding round for the &amp;pound;320M UK Treasury fund for the Heat Networks Investment Project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6D840C9-6725-4DC9-AE2A-92A5236ED982</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c71ee2ec79.28049030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence on Danish, German and UK comparative policy and practice for low carbon heat and energy efficiency presented to the 2016 Scottish meeting of the UK Committee on Climate Change (UKCCC)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DFA040F8-B5DD-4816-B6CB-9034530E3F32</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c48d656338.56383846</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Nominated UK Expert to IEA District Heating and Cooling Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F99B102A-0744-4F77-A954-C3368A06FF8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2d0607fcd69.64341208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited Thought Leader for Scottish Government National Energy Efficiency Programme</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC232EC5-E3E7-42F4-B77A-9300D0CDE9DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Scottish Ministers announced in June 2015 that they would take long-term action to reduce the energy demand of, and decarbonise the heat supply to, residential, services and industrial sectors, and designated energy efficiency as a national infrastructure priority.

This programme aims to contribute to achieving climate change targets, whilst continuing to help tackle fuel poverty and ensuring support for business. SEEP will lead to an estimated investment in excess of &amp;pound;10 billion; the final figure will be determined by decisions taken on the future decarbonisation of the heat supply.
The Programme for Government 2016-17 commits to investing more than &amp;pound;0.5 billion in energy efficiency and combating fuel poverty through SEEP over the next four years, setting out a clear commitment to develop this programme with substantial annual public funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2cfc3515952.08096468</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/energy-and-climate-change-directorate/scotlands-energy-efficiency-programme/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Drafted sections of Scottish Government 2017 &amp;quot;Consultation on Heat &amp;amp; Energy Efficiency Strategies, and Regulation of District Heating&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>444E10FB-9126-4517-B2B1-E0C32F3F7F55</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b91978b683.55410171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://consult.scotland.gov.uk/energy-and-climate-change-directorate/local-heat-and-energy-efficiency/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK Government BEIS Ministerial roundtable on Domestic Energy Efficiency and Heat, October 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>85D4B4CB-0E2C-4167-B8EF-E362849BAE46</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c4fa1bafc6.40516679</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Heat and Energy Efficiency: Advisory Group Report to the UK Committee on Climate Change - Making Effective Policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8734C6A-2FEA-49A2-A2F4-8933B14CBB1B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2c40b6e1a14.34336789</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/heat-and-energy-efficiency-advisory-group-report-making-effective-policy/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Scottish Government District Heating Loans Fund Panel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6422764-0797-43E1-981D-D054F0850098</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since 2011, more than &amp;pound;10M has been lent to 40 different projects across Scotland.
