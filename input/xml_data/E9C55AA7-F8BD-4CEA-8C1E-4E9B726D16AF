According to the Complementary Learning Systems model, interplay between hippocampal and neocortical brain areas is thought to underpin this process, with the relative contribution of each area to learning determined by the structural properties of the new memories, as well as their relationship with existing memories. Specifically, the level of systematicity within a set of new memories is predicted to be inversely related to the involvement of the hippocampus in their learning and its interaction with the neocortex during sleep.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These novel predictions have not been explored in the context of memory consolidation. However, the influence of systematicity has been studied extensively in the context of language processing, and this research has informed key debates in psycholinguistics. We will exploit existing language paradigms to evaluate the influence of systematicity on the role of sleep in consolidation of new memories. The results of our studies will be influential in two ways. First, they will bring a new dimension to key debates in psycholinguistics by determining whether and how sleep influences language processing. More broadly, they will inform models of the influence of sleep on long-term memory formation&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>311017</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As described in our proposal we see our research as primarily fundamental science, with potential medium to long-term societal impact.

Specifically, and consistent with the predictions of the CLS model, we have discovered that sleep-related consolidation is particularly beneficial for the learning of new arbitrary mappings and plays little or no role in the consolidation of new systematic mappings or new mappings consistent with the existing knowledge. 
In our studies we used carefully designed language materials that incorporated crucial properties of natural languages, allowing us to test the role of memory consolidation processes under various circumstances in language learning. For example, in one study we used novel words that mimicked properties of grammatical gender systems of natural languages, and we manipulated systematicity and arbitrariness within the same set of items. We discovered that when learning a novel set of mappings, unrelated to existing knowledge, sleep-related consolidation improved the memory of the arbitrary aspects of the novel words, but not their systematic (grammatical) aspects. In a different study, we used the English past tense to examine the influence of the consistency of the new with the existing knowledge in learning and consolidation of the novel forms, which resembled the existing English past tense forms to different degrees. In this study, we discovered that new forms consistent with the existing knowledge were easier to acquire, and the memory for those forms changed little over time. However, the new forms which were inconsistent with the existing knowledge were more difficult to acquire, and moreover the consolidation of the memory for these forms benefitted most from sleep-related strengthening. In summary, we have refined our understanding of the role of sleep in learning different types of linguistic materials, and in ongoing data analyses we are working on identifying specific properties of sleep which play a role in supporting new mapping inconsistent with the existing knowledge. In another ongoing study we are extending these findings to the spelling-sound domain.
During the grant, we have established several new collaborations which will allow us to extend this research into new domains. In collaboration with colleagues from MRC CBU we are developing a study to investigate the neural underpinnings of the sleep-related consolidation of new arbitrary mappings. We have also established a collaboration with developmental psychologists and we are currently extending the studies from the grant to explore developmental differences in the role of sleep related consolidation in learning new systematic and arbitrary mappings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In collaboration with colleagues from the Donders Institute (Netherlands), University of Fribourg (Switzerland) and University of Freiburg (Germany) we have submitted a grant aimed to develop systems to aid second language learning during sleep.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2CBD38DE-CB99-4389-B044-7DA89A5BFA55</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447d42a6a3ee4.71064679</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>797C06BA-35F9-4BDB-B163-D3268A142A5C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does Sleep Improve Your Grammar?
