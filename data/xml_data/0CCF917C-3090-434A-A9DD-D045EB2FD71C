Although most of the cloth was spun and woven in the countryside or smaller towns, it was finished by fullers (called tuckers locally), dyers and shearmen in Exeter itself. Exeter and its estuary port of Topsham grew rapidly, initially mainly trading to France and Spain, but later chiefly to the Netherlands, with serge replacing broadcloth kerseys as the main products. The cloth producers in Exeter were represented by the Company of Weavers, Fullers and Shearmen, based in, and hence commonly known as, Tuckers Hall (with about 500 members at its peak in c.1700). They received a royal charter in 1620, making them one of three royally chartered bodies in the city, the others being the city itself (given county status in 1539) and the Company of Merchant Adventurers, representing the overseas traders, who in turn dominated the membership of the city council. With the decline of Devon's cloth trade from 1720 the Tuckers Hall became a largely charitable and social organisation. Its present-day membership of local businessmen is developing educational schemes to make best use of the Hall and its archives, and to promote understanding of the city's cloth trade history for local people of all ages and tourists. With Heritage Lottery funding awarded in 2010, they are working with other local bodies (Exeter Canal and Quay Trust, Topsham Museum and DRO) to develop digital and other resources for a better understanding of the cloth trade and of Exeter's port history. This project is a collaboration with the History Department at Exeter University to support a doctoral student (supervised by Jonathan Barry and Jane Whittle, together with Mike Walker the Tuckers Hall Project Manager) to work on the social history of the cloth trade in its most significant period, using the extensive archives of the city, parishes and Tuckers Hall itself, as well as national records. The four main lines of enquiry of the doctoral thesis are:\n1.Identifying who Exeter's elite were - in terms of wealth and of office holding in the main urban institutions - and how they related to, and differed from, the wider middling sort, especially those involved in the cloth trade.\n2.The nature of the cloth trade, and in particular the interplay between the production of cloth (in the region and within Exeter itself) and its trading nationally and internationally. How did changes in the cloth trade (especially the rise of serge production for the Dutch market) affect (or reflect) social relations within the trade and the city?\n3.The role of urban institutions. The role played by civic government, the Merchant Adventurers' Company, and Tuckers Hall in establishing both individual social position and in brokering and developing relationships between the different elements of the cloth trade, both in the city and externally. How did this change over time, particularly after the Civil War?\n4.The role of the family. The role of women in work and in transmitting business expertise and wealth. The degree to which status and wealth was inherited. What factors determined social mobility within the cloth trade and the city, and was this an open elite or a closed one?\nThe PhD student will also, after appropriate training and with support from the Tuckers Hall project team, work closely with the volunteers working on the digitisation project and assist in the public presentation of the research outcomes from all the projects. This will benefit not only an academic audience interested in the most important trade and one of the most important towns in England, but also the broader public, with a particular focus on schoolchildren, community</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This CDA involves collaboration with Tuckers Hall in a series of projects which are intended by them (as a charitable organisation) to provide beneficial impacts to a series of user communities, working in conjunction with other organisations with similar aims (Devon Record Office, Topsham Museum, Exeter Canal and Quay Trust). These have already been recognised, by the award of &amp;pound;90,000 of Heritage Lottery funding, as an effective means to deliver benefits to the region. Apart from assisting these organisations in achieving their own purposes, the CDA will directly deliver benefits to a series of user communities:\n1. the volunteers on the projects will be supported in learning research and communication skills, including ICT skills, and the opportunity to share their work with a wider public, so developing community engagement;\n2. source packs and digital resources will be prepared for the use of local schools, and school parties will visit the exhibitions at Tuckers Hall and the other sites, where they will be able to develop research and ICT skills, as well as historical awareness of the roots of their city's prosperity;\n3.other civic organisations will also be able to use the online and exhibition facilities in the same way;\n4. the exhibition material will interest and attract tourists wishing to discover more about Exeter's heritage, while the online materials will encourage visitors to the city;\n5.the digital resources will be useful to family and local historians, enabling them to search for people or places of interest to them.\n\nThe CDA student will assist in the delivery of these beneficial impacts both by disseminating the outcomes of his/her own research through the project outputs, and by supporting other members of the project teams (especially the volunteers) and ensuring that their own work meets high standards of historical accuracy, as well as the varied needs and interests of the different communities.\n\nThe university will also ensure that,in addition to its impact on the Tuckers Hall projects, the CDA student's research makes the best possible impact on the wider society. Maximising the impact of our research is at the centre of the University of Exeter's strategic mission and the College of Humanities works closely with the University's Research &amp;amp; Knowledge Transfer (RKT) Office to achieve this. RKT has expertise in IP protection, management and exploitation. The College is supported in its impact activities by a dedicated RKT Manager, hence well-established and robust mechanisms are in place for exploiting knowledge exchange opportunities and a wealth of expertise can be called on to oversee and encourage the impact of arts and humanities research outside the academic sector. RKT has an events team that facilitates research dissemination activities and the College also works closely with a dedicated Press Officer for the Arts and Humanities to ensure that research findings are publicised widely. There is also academic expertise within the College in fields such as digital archiving, experimental archaeology and place-based performance, so that the student's work can reach a broad range of members of the local (and wider) community through varying media.\n \nThe proposed project will find support within the vibrant collaborative research environment of the University, which has worked on numerous CDAs with partners including the British Museum, Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, Royal Geographic Society, the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and Punchdrunk. This experience will be built on to ensure the success of the project for the student, Tuckers Hall and the University.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I023902/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
