In terms of cancer risk prediction, many studies have been published showing statistically significant correlations between certain radiographic tissue characteristics observed within a mammographic image, and the subject ultimately developing breast cancer. Recent interest in such techniques has surged as the desire grows to more specifically target the huge undertaking of a general screening programme. This is not only to reduce economic burden, but to ensure those at high risk get optimal care, particularly through the use of other (more expensive) imaging modalities, such as contrast enhanced MRI, to supplement the x-ray mammogram. Unfortunately many of the existing breast density assessment techniques have a number of short comings: generally they rely on reader visual assessment of an uncertain feature set, and so badly suffer from reader subjectivity; and almost universally the effect of the characteristics of the x-rays used for acquisition on tissue appearance within the image are ignored. Building upon the firm foundation of my existing work in modelling the image formation process, in particular the inclusion of scattered radiation, and the standard attenuation rate measure of radiodensity we pioneered, we aim to build a fully automated assessment technique, which takes account of the effects of the image acquisition parameters and therefore solely depends on the tissue present. Using state of the art computer learning methods, a database of all the digital mammograms acquired over two years by our clinical collaborator, and a feature description vector that will be iteratively developed during the project, a thorough and detailed analysis will be performed to establish as specifically as possible the underlying tissue features within a breast likely to develop cancer. The work will also extend, using the same methodology, to the computer detection of malignancies, in the form of both microcalcifications and lesions, in the hope of improving the sensitivity and specificity of the existing contrast feature recognition algorithms.Further the application of the developed techniques to three-dimensional mammography, in particular tomosynthesis will be undertaken. Three-dimensional mammography gives the enormous benefit of removing feature noise : the complication of several structures occupying different vertical positions in the breast becoming superimposed upon each other within the projection image and thereby appearing as a single entity. This has been found to decrease mammographic sensitivity by masking malignancies surrounded by radiographically dense tissue. The application of the model of image formation, and in particular the software correction of scatter which removes the harmful dose implications of the use of physical grid anti-scatter devices, upon the reconstruction of the three-dimensional volume data from the source projection images is also being developed in this work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>261007</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G049424/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1F190F7B-B800-40B2-B250-62AD4842598F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioinformatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3730AA1C-F09A-4945-8874-DEF6237C50CD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lasers &amp; Optics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
