Radid advances in clinical care have extended life expectancy in life limiting and non-curative illness. As a result of the extension of life expectancy, poor prognosis can mean living with dying for a number of years. Patients with life-limiting illness report a low quality of life and high levels of anxiety or depression. This raises two significant challenges: How can subjective well-being be enhanced for this cohort of patients? Can we develop an appropriate structured clinical response to what are often existential worries. 

Workshop: Thinking about Dying? (20 participants)
The question for this workshop is: 'can we live 'right up to death'?'
1. Do cross-ethnic, cultural and religious perspectives provide new ways to frame living with dying?
2. Does it make sense to talk about well-being during life-limiting illness?
3. How personal is 'my death'?
Adriana Cavarero invited to give public lecture (120 audience)

Workshop: Mental Health and Living with Dying ( 2 day event: 20 participants in workshop / open registration (&amp;pound;30 to cover cost))
The problem for this conference is: 'how can we map well-being during life-limiting illness?'. Questions include:
1. How is the sense of 'who I am' unsettled at this time?
2. What is the relationship between remorse, loss, guilt, shame, and fear to life-limiting illness?
3. How can we can accommodate new identities, bodily shapes and somatic capacities at this time?
Arthur Frank invited to give public lecture (120 audience)

Workshop: The Clinical Model of Care (20 participants)
The problem for this will be 'does the current clinical model adequately address the needs of patients living with dying?'. Questions for the workshop include:
1. Do we have the right level of understanding andknowledge of the needs of this cohort of patients?
2. What is the role of therapy in care?
3. How might we adapt communication practices to make them more appropriate?


The following public events aim to involve patients in the development of new material and 'softer' approaches.

Food for Thought:Reading as Therapy
This session will be organised by the nationally recognised 'Reader Organisation'. It will involve piloting a range of suitable reading material. 100 participants. 

DaDa Festival: Changing Bodies
Drawing on critical disability theory, this session at the DaDa festival will deal with how identities changes during this period and ask how we might learn to live with changing body shapes and capabilities. Expected footfall 120 (capacity of the Bluecoat) and web streaming of content. 

Stimulus session: Encounters with Nature
There is already empirical research to show the importance of encounters with nature during times of trauma; in particular when living with dying. Working with Ness Gardens and the Sefton Allotment Movement we will investiage how to translate existing empirical research - that encounters with nature significantly enhance well-being - into practice. These patients have altered capacities, can often be tired and unable to have sole responsibility for an allotment or garden. By sharing allotments, patients can achieve the benefit of encounters with nature without feeling it a burden. 30 people involved in the workshop then a rota of patients will be established.

Patients Forum
To feedback results from previous sessions and to test the usefulness of patient material developed during the previous sessions.

By the end of the project we expect to have collated personal stories to be included on the website and as a publication 'Cancer Stories'; to have produced two journal articles and patient material as well as policy on the role of nature in non-curable</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>* Patients: the purpose of the network and its activities is to enhance the quality of life for those with life-limiting illness. Activities, such as the Patients' Forum, the session at DaDa, the Stimulus Session with Sefton Allotment and Ness Gardens and the Food for Thought session with the Reader Organisation, should all deliver some immediate benefits to local users. The material on the web site, useful reading and autobiographies, is to be accessed directly. The one objective of all the workshops is to identify weakness in the current care of this patient group and devise a structured 'holistic' or 'existential' approach to patient care for those with life-limiting illness. So, longer term the patient group who benefit could be extensive. 

* Health Services: The Unit of Palliative Care and the Liverpool Psychology and Cancer Care Research Group will be able to translate workshop discussion into plans for focussed evidence-based research. Longer term this should provide health providers with guidance for supporting this expanding patient group. The aim is to devise a structured approach to care for this group.

* Third Sector: the Department of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool works closely with Tate, Liverpool, National Museums and Galleries, FACT and the Biennial and will be drawing on these relationships for its session at DaDa. The Department of Music works with the Liverpool Philharmonic. The Department of English is home to the award-winning Reader Organisation. The particular existential and therapeutic needs of this patient cohort is more likely to be addressed through music, art, poetry, reading and film than through 'counselling' serives. But as a group their knowledge or understanding of, or access to, the Arts might be limited. Work with cultural partners will provide a creative and imaginative therapeutic space. This community engagement will benefit the Museums and Galleries. 

* Wider Public: one research-thread concerns the role of nature in palliative care. Work with Ness Gardens and the Allottment movement will begin to implement empirically-driven insights that gardening and encounters with nature have significant impact on well-being and happiness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24096</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thinking about Dying?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D02D3C30-DD15-4293-8253-B1B31510720D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The question that was addressed by this workshop is: Is it possible to improve the subjective well-being of people with life-limiting illnesses and can we affirm life right up to death?

It involved discussion of how cultures provide sources in terms of ways of thinking, talking or acting in the face of the experience of loss, challenges to identity and consequent suffering that life-limiting illnesses may engender.

mainly from Philosophy but also healthcare backgrounds, who shared a range of perspectives and approaches to this question. As well as providing a fascinating forum for the exhange of views in itself it also laid the foundation for two other events
