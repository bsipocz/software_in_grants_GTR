For musical instruments, as for any tool for creative expression, the standards of success in a design are difficult to quantify, since standard HCI (human-computer interaction) metrics of accuracy and speed do not necessarily correlate with what musicians find expressive. More problematic still is the fluid and unpredictable relationship between designer and user. From the saxophone to the electric guitar to the turntable, musicians have been appropriating and even subverting instrument designs to produce music in ways the designer never anticipated. Some of the past century's most transformative changes in musical performance practice have arguably come from performers radically reinterpreting an instrument's capabilities and limitations. Digital musical instrument researchers therefore face a quandary: how can an interface be designed which embraces the user's wilful subversion of its original goals?

This project will produce a design methodology and a hardware-software platform for the creation of 'hackable instruments': instruments which embrace the performer's reinterpretation and modification. This kind of end-user (mis)appropriation is currently more prevalent among acoustic and analogue electronic instruments than digital musical instruments. The typical computer music interface is designed such that arbitrary modification by non-experts is more likely to produce catastrophic failure than interesting results. Moreover, in comparison to acoustic instruments, whose operation is easy to understand, a lack of transparency in how a digital instrument works can discourage the performer from fully exploring its capabilities.

User studies with musicians and instrument designers form the foundation of the project. The goal of these studies is to understand the exploration process musicians employ when adapting an instrument to their needs and to establish what features of an instrument design facilitate creative repurposing. In parallel, fundamental research on audio processing on embedded devices will lead to a hardware instrument platform that is robust to modification by the end user. Using this platform, several instrument designs will be created to test specific hypotheses about the factors promoting 'hackability' in an instrument. These designs will be evaluated in extended user trials which culminate in a public concert performance.

Many of the transformative changes in musical performance practice originated with the creativity of a few individuals, but their impact depended on dissemination throughout a larger community. Community-building is critically important in digital musical instrument research, and the results of this project will be publicly distributed as an open platform for instrument creation. Several initial instrument designs will be created to encourage exploration and modification, and all hardware and software designs will be released under open-source licenses. Thorough documentation will be provided to enable researchers and self-trained hackers alike to make use of the platform well beyond the duration of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By exploring the creative contributions of musical performers to the design process and forging links among communities, this project holds benefits to several groups beyond academic researchers, both in the UK and internationally. These include:

Commercial Private Sector:

* Professional performers and composers, who will benefit from a new set of expressive digital tools. The platform resulting from this project will also give musicians greater ownership over the operation of their instruments, encouraging new forms of creative expression.
* Concert promoters and venues, who can use new instrument technology to appeal to new audiences.
* Musical instrument and audio equipment manufacturers, who can produce new designs tailored carefully to individual markets.
* Electronics manufacturers and distributors, who can develop and sell tools for musical interface creation. Open-source hardware makes the designs available freely to all, but it is also an important economic engine, as evidenced by successful companies like Arduino in Italy and SparkFun and AdaFruit in the United States. This project will help establish the UK as a major driver of the open hardware movement.

Public and Third Sectors:

* Educators, particularly at the secondary level and above, who can use musical instrument design to enhance instruction in scientific and mathematical fields.
* Independent organisations promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) to young people and underrepresented groups, by using music to generate interest in STEM careers.
* Museums, through new interactive exhibits that encourage audience creativity.

Wider Public:

* Amateur musicians, who can make use of the project tools to motivate learning and create personal means of expression.
* Students in both technical and musical fields, who can create links between scientific and musical domains to better understand both disciplines.
* Electronics and programming hobbyists, who in the past decade have formed a growing online 'maker' community devoted to creative open-source hardware design. The project will allow these individuals to apply their skills to the development and dissemination of new musical instruments. In turn, their activities building on project results will have the potential to benefit future digital musical instrument research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97981</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>10 musicians played a public concert using a deliberately very constrained instrument, exploring how simple tools are used in creative ways.</gtr:description><gtr:id>61143200-E4DD-469C-A0C2-96F43CDFD556</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advanced the research by understanding reaction of performers and audience to highly constrained instruments.

The programme also included performances by two other designer-performers: Dianne Verdonk (Utrecht, Netherlands) playing her instrument La Diantenne, and Tim Exile (London, UK) playing his Flow Machine. These performances were coupled with a research study of the audience experience in live electronic music performance.

The audience contained 65 members not including the organisers (5-6 further people). This filled the venue to capacity. The audience took part in written surveys and live smartphone-based data feedback during the performance which was used as the basis for the research study. A paper has been submitted to the New Interfaces for Musical Expression 2016 conference (Brisbane, Australia) with a longer journal paper in preparation as of March 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4FF0184A-6DAA-4479-8112-89F8E6B7E2DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The concert was well received by the audience and brought in some audience members who had not previously been to QMUL before.

The workshop had 8 participants who were digital musical instrument designers, plus several other people attending as observers. The event was facilitated by two technical organisers and two other researchers. The instrument designers each brought an existing instrument design which they ported to Bela with the help of the organisers. We recorded audio and video from the session, including regular interviews with each participant.

Since the original workshop, we have held several additional workshops throughout 2016 and 2017, together reaching several hundred people. Events have taken place in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Brighton, Berlin, Toronto, Baton Rouge and Brisbane, among others. Some events have targeted hobbyists and makers; others have targeted musicians and industry professionals; still others have targeted undergraduate and postgraduate students.

These include three concerts in London and several independent events by the performers involved (in UK, USA, Canada, Japan). The continuing use and exploration of the instruments has been encouraging.

Our findings on approaches to musical interface design have influenced an ongoing debate in the digital musical instrument research community about complexity, constraints and appropriation of technology. These topics featured prominently in a recent thesis at Goldsmiths University of London, and a group of students at QMUL repeated our study of constrained instruments. Challenging the notion that more complex interfaces produce richer musical outcomes may be one of the more important lasting results of this research. This idea seems to be gaining influence within the digital musical instrument community. More broadly, an understanding of the ways that musicians use technology in unexpected ways has informed current research directions on the EPSRC Fellowship &amp;quot;Design for Virtuosity&amp;quot; (EP/N005112/1).

The most high-profile impact of this research has been the Bela low-latency audio platform which we created to support the musical instruments we designed for our research studies. During the funded period, we conducted workshops and hacking events, and since then the project has grown in both capability and profile. Many new features have been added to make it a high-performance general-purpose tool for creating interactive audio systems. The entire project is open source. 

In April 2016, Bela completed a highly successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising over &amp;pound;54k (nearly 1100% of its original goal) from 530 backers worldwide. The campaign grew the global user base of Bela by an order of magnitude and led several months later to the formation of a spinout company, Augmented Instruments Ltd, which is now selling and developing the Bela kits. The community continues to grow, supported by a diverse set of online resources and example projects; most recently, we are making efforts to reach educators with Bela. It is being used in a number of university courses in the US and UK. We have also received a grant from Innovate UK to expand the commercial development of Bela.</gtr:description><gtr:id>92EAD5C7-893C-4B87-841B-2FBE5BC6CA37</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54649f0e064f70.37440269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research explored how musicians use technology, including digital musical instruments, in creative ways that the designer did not expect. We conducted a study which showed the value of constraints in eliciting creativity. 10 performers were given an extremely limited instrument and asked to prepare 2 performances; a surprising variety of unusual playing techniques emerged including many we did not explicitly design for. 

An important result of the study was to challenge the notion that more complex instruments are needed to produce richer musical outcomes. In our study, half of the performers received an instrument with two major controls (pitch and timbre) while the other half received an instrument with only one control (timbre). Remarkably, performers who received a one-dimensional instrument found it to be richer and more capable than those with the two-dimensional instrument, and they showed a corresponding greater range of interaction techniques. This demonstrates that sometimes strict limitations can be a musical asset.

We also investigated the motivations and methods behind the practices of musical instrument hacking and circuit bending, interviewing several practitioners. We applied these findings to the creation of a new instrument, the D-Box, which is open to modification by the performer. It can be completely rewired internally to produce a wide range of new sounds. We demonstrated its usability in a second user study with 10 musicians. Experienced circuit benders were able to apply their techniques to the instrument, and musicians without hacking experience were also able to explore and discover new sounds. Each of the 10 performances was strikingly different in its musical content and interaction techniques, suggesting that we achieved our goal of making an instrument which is open to creative reinterpretation. Following the funded period, we have continued to explore this line of enquiry including through public workshops with the D-Box where we investigate the concept of exploratory play in relation to human-computer interaction.

In the process of building these instruments, we developed Bela, a new ultra-low-latency audio platform based on the BeagleBone Black embedded computer. The platform captures real-time audio and sensor data and is suitable for creating high-performance, self-contained digital musical instruments. We have released this platform open source and have conducted several workshops to introduce it to designers and programmers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings on how the capabilities and constraints of a musical instrument influence the creative decisions of performers suggest new approaches for future instrument designers, both academic and industrial. In particular, we observed the value of clear, simple metaphors for interacting with the instrument, and the importance of avoiding dimensions of control which paradoxically make the performer feel more restricted. Instrument designers can also use our techniques for designing open, modifiable instruments which operate on different principles than commonly-used modular synthesis approaches.

The low-latency audio platform we developed will be of use to a broad range of engineers, researchers and hobbyists, and it contributes to the growing open-source maker community. In the 18 months since we first showed early previews to people outside QMUL, the platform has gained substantial traction. As of the end of 2015, around 30 people (in academia and industry) had acquired the hardware from us to use in their own projects. On February 29, 2016 we launched a Kickstarter campaign which reached nearly 1100% of its original funding goal, &amp;pound;54,902 in total, from 530 backers. We subsequently formed a spinout company, Augmented Instruments Ltd, to continue sales and development of Bela.

Performances with the D-Box instrument created on the Hackable Instruments project have continued in the 2015-17 period. Musicians in the final user study were able to keep their instruments at the end, and several more have acquired D-Boxes from our events and through the Kickstarter campaign. Finally, we ran a series of workshops introducing musicians and nonmusicians to circuit bending and hacking techniques as ways of creatively exploring electronics. The workshops have themselves led to further publications which investigate how people explore unfamiliar musical technology (DIS 2016), and how communities form around open-source tools (CHI 2017).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E82FAA3-A67E-4F18-B634-067D5ADEFA44</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649d44efb665.39937338</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/hackable.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Bela (formerly called BeagleRT) is an ultra-low-latency real-time audio platform for the BeagleBone Black embedded computer.

With less than 1ms of latency between action and sound, Bela performs faster than any other computer-based environment on the market, including high-spec laptops. It also features audio-rate sampling of every analog and digital input which makes design of sensor systems convenient. In 2015, a built-in browser-based IDE was added along with support for the Pure Data graphical computer music language widely used in the digital music community. Since 2016, we have continued to add support for other programming languages and hardware accessories, as well as extending the documentation and online resources available to the community.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB328789-B114-4764-BF8E-D971FDE40F88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-17 period, with the number of users and community members growing every month.

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking &amp;pound;5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign), ultimately raising &amp;pound;55k from over 500 backers. Following the campaign, we received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands, University of Virginia, University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, Goldsmiths University and several others) and industry (Cycling74, makers of the popular Max/MSP software). 

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL). Following the successful Kickstarter campaign, we spun out a new company, Augmented Instruments Ltd, to commercialise the platform, and relaunched a public web shop in October 2016. We maintain several community resources, including a blog, wiki, web forum and several social media accounts. Our users actively contribute to these resources and frequently share projects they make using Bela. Community development itself has become an area of research for us (e.g. Morreale et al., &amp;quot;Building a maker community around an open hardware platform&amp;quot;, Proc. CHI 2017), and we have received a grant from Innovate UK (Feb-Oct 2017) to further develop the platform and build our community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545bb694961050.49097753</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Bela Audio Platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://bela.io</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Augmented Instruments Ltd</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Augmented Instruments Ltd is a spinout from the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, incorporated on 8 September 2016.

Technology is licensed from QMUL to Augmented Instruments Ltd, which develops and sells direct to consumers and conducts business consultancy related to the technologies.

The company's first product is Bela (http://bela.io), an open-source embedded computing platform for ultra-low-latency processing of audio and sensor data. Bela, originally known as BeagleRT, was developed starting in 2014 in the Augmented Instruments Laboratory. Since its creation for a specific musical instrument, it has gradually grown into a general-purpose platform aimed at the maker and musician communities. It couples high performance (1GHz processor, submillisecond latency, high-bandwidth, synchronous gathering of audio and sensor data) with ease of use (a browser-based development environment and support for popular computer music programming languages).

On 1 April 2016, Bela completed a highly successful Kickstarter campaign which raised &amp;pound;54,902 (out of an original goal of &amp;pound;5k). This provided the seed funding to spin out the company, which has subsequently been supported by sales of Bela.</gtr:description><gtr:id>266C61DD-D283-48FB-8307-69F918C46A73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Augmented Instruments Ltd launched Bela for public sale in October 2016.
