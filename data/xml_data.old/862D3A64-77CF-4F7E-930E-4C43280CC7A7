Supply chain accounting involves using innovative accounting and management control practices to evaluate relationships between an organisation and its customers and suppliers in order to ensure that these relationships create value, are cost effective, and/or meet additional criteria such as labour standards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Intended outcomes of the project include:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>an enhanced understanding of the impact of dominant parties on the employment practices of subordinate parties in supply chains&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a supply chain accounting approach that promotes better labour standards&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contributions toward the development of global and local commodity chain theory.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The three-year interdisciplinary project uses a multi-method approach, involving:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a literature review that explores relationships between global commodity chains, supply chain accounting and employment practices&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a survey of automotive and textile companies in Brazil and South Africa&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>case study research within ten supply chains, including documentary analysis and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The economic and social dimensions of this research should facilitate positive outcomes for a range of stakeholders, but particularly for workers and organisations.&lt;/p>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit a wide range of stakeholders concerned with SCA and employment relations in emerging economies, including those based in advanced economies. Key beneficiaries include: 
-Practitioners within the fields of accounting and HR, particularly within the automotive and textile sectors; 
-CEOs and shareholders; 
-Civil servants and government ministers in departments for employment and business;
-Trade unionists such as the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, and the Central Unica dos Trabalhadores; employment lawyers and non-governmental organisations; 
-Accreditation and related bodies interested in maintaining professional standards such as CIMA and CIPD that are UK based but seeking to extend membership globally to include emerging economies (evidenced by the CIMAGlobal initiative and the CIPD's new office in Singapore); 
-Employer bodies in the textile and automotive industries in South Africa and Brazil; and 
-Students studying for qualifications in HR and accounting. 
 
The research will benefit the above beneficiaries by shedding light on the nature of commodity chains, inter and intra continental SCA, and its implications for employment relations. In contributing toward the development of more efficient, effective, and accountable supply chains, and in evaluating the employment practices used, it has the potential to impact on competitiveness and sustainability. The project will result in outcomes that are relevant to each of the countries, but also yield comparative findings, shedding light on the situation in countries with relatively open (South African) and relatively closed (Brazilian) economies. In particular, the project will enable a wider understanding of the nature of supply chain accounting techniques, providing useful information for potential customers, suppliers, and investors in those nations, with implications for competitiveness and wealth creation. In addition, it will yield insights into the employment relations of key manufacturing firms and their suppliers that can be used by policy makers, NGOs, employer organisations and trade unionists to develop more ethical guidelines and procedures for monitoring and promoting sustainable and ethical employment practices. 

Plans for interaction with the above beneficiaries: 
1) The Advisory Board (AB) includes practitioner and professional association members including the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accounting (CIMA). AB members will be involved in an ongoing basis in the project design, development of toolkits and recommendations, and dissemination. 
2) The accessible and interactive website will enable discussion on the project's progress, the sharing of good practice examples, and the evaluation of SCA-Emp toolkits. Its continuation after the project completion will facilitate an assessment of impacts on policy and practice (Wiles, Bardsley and Powell, 2009). 
3) Project workshops in UK, Brazil and South Africa will be used for discussing initial findings, refining SCA-Emp toolkits, and helping to build an SCA-Emp Community of Practice (CoP) involving multiple stakeholders. 
4) Workshops will be run through the Public Service Academy, the CIPD, CIMA and law firms 
5) Ongoing media engagement will be facilitated by Sheffield University's press office, including: soundbites for NGOs, e-bulletins for lawyers and press releases to unions 
6) Articles in practitioner journals relating to accounting, SCM and HRM will enable dissemination of results in an accessible form in South Africa, Brazil and the UK. 
7) The final symposium will present key findings and involve consultation on the refinement of toolkits and feasible recommendations so that these might inform and guide practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>214801</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CIPD Branch Workshop at University of Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EF66B6E-1079-4974-97BB-04015531F488</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SCA-Emp toolkit was presented to HR practitioners.

The toolkit was developed in collaboration with practitioners and professional bodies from UK, South Africa and Brazil, including: in the UK CIPD (HR) and CIMA (accounting); in Brazil, ABRH (Human Resource Management) and employer federations (e.g. FIEP and FIEPE, Brazil); and in South Africa the South African Board for People Practices (SABPP). We launched the toolkit (English and Portuguese versions) in June 2016.

We have produced marketing materials (leaflets and banners) in English and Portuguese and a website www.sca-emp.com which supports a downloadable Excel version of the toolkit and direct completion online and includes a short video. The website includes registration questions to obtain details of who has accessed the toolkit so that we can follow them up, and also questions about their purpose for using the toolkit. In August 2016, there were visits to companies and employer organisations in Brazil, leading to 43 toolkit downloads by private sector companies, NGOs and public sector bodies. Their stated purpose for using the toolkit has included, for example: a training guide for early career managers around ethical practices in the supply chain (NGO, 7 employees); to evaluate HR (company, 27 employees); planning (company of 300 employees), and improving logistics (company of 4,000 employees). We have also run toolkit workshops in UK, SA and Brazil. Subsequent to the August 2016 visits to Brazil, the Brazilian HR body (ABRH) returned the visit and met with research team members in October 2016 in Sheffield to discuss the potential for future collaboration.

Our aim is to achieve economic, commercial, organisational and policy impacts. Our work aligns with the strategic objectives of the ESRC in two main ways. First, our intention is to substantially increase the use of the diagnostic toolkit by developing non-academic networks of business practitioners, employer federations, small company incubators, and trade unionists. To date, the impact has involved the following: engagement with over 300 people, around whom about 90 have been more closely involved as members of a community of practice; feedback from workshops; and verbal responses. Our plan is to significantly increase the number of practitioners within this network and then facilitate the sharing of 'best practice' in relation to the toolkit, and more generally, in terms of the findings of the project, through further blogs and individual conversations. Second, we will seek to influence policy changes using focused briefings and through local government and the media in South Africa and Brazil.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>65B22041-AF52-4AE5-A849-DEE50B1BF317</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d43065a47b18.59918676</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The central aims of the 'SCA-Emp' study were to explore the extent of knowledge of automotive, and clothing and textile firms of work and employment practices down their supply chains, and the present role and future potential of supply chain accounting in monitoring and promoting better labour standards. The study was conducted within two key emerging market settings, Brazil and South Africa. The objectives were achieved through a detailed survey of over 100 automotive and textile firms in South Africa and Brazil, in addition to case study research within textiles and automotive firms in both countries and interviews with senior personnel within professional bodies, trade unions and employer organisations. The case study research generated over 150 in-depth interviews. 

A key achievement is the interdisciplinary nature of the research, resulting in findings regarding: the relationship between supply chain accounting and employment practices; the challenges and opportunities presented by engaging in international and co-productive research; outsourcing strategies of manufacturing firms; strategic alliances within manufacturing firms; contending with pressures towards localization and globalization of supply chains; and monitoring of HR down supply chains.

We found that while automotive companies in South Africa and Brazil have tried to employ workers fairly (including quite progressive disabilities policies), knowledge flows of suppliers' employment practices rapidly diminished down the supply chain. In Brazilian automotive companies, relationships with tier one suppliers remained strong, but cost cutting pressures had led to arms' length contracting with suppliers of basic components further down the supply chain. This was accompanied by a lack of knowledge of employment practices, with basic components sourced via intermediaries in Asia. In South African automotive companies, tier one suppliers were used to fulfil key parts of the final production process, enabling labour to fall under a different industry's inferior collective bargaining and wage rates. In clothing and textiles firms, although there were some examples of good practice, with one company offering lifetime employment, jobs tended to have weak job tenure, employment conditions and health and safety, and not be unionised, leading to a lack of effective worker voice. In rural areas, there was a tendency toward informality. Exceptional cases notwithstanding, the sector faced an acute crisis of competitiveness in the face of cheap imports from China and South Asia. 

Key findings have already been published in international (Chartered ABS List 3*) journals and disseminated via practitioner workshops and publications, the media in Brazil, and leading academic conferences (e.g. the Academy of Management).

An important practical achievement is the co-produced, open access 'SCA-Emp' diagnostic toolkit which aims to help companies to achieve sustainable, ethical supply chains while balancing people and profit. Companies can use the toolkit to check current practices within the firm, as a strategy planner across departments, or share it with their supply chain partners to encourage best practice. The 'SCA-Emp' toolkit has been shared with companies in South Africa, Brazil and the UK during company visits and workshops. It is freely available at: www.sca-emp.com.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes might be taken forward in four main ways. Firstly, they may promote interdisciplinarity, and further joint working between the disciplines of employment relations and accounting. Secondly, the study may be used to generate case studies for Masters' degrees and executive education. Thirdly, they can inform critical debates within the fields of HR, accounting and supply chain management. In particular, although much research exists on automotive and clothing and textile industries, there is limited work on employment relations down supply chains below the final point of production. Our findings reveal the decomposition of relations at the bottom of automotive industry supply chains, suggesting the need for follow up studies of this phenomenon. Fourthly, the study contributes to further development of global value chain theory, through evidencing the ebb and flow between localization and globalization of supply chain relations, with closer integration of tier one supplier production but sourcing of basic components via intermediaries in the Far East - serving a single agenda of cost cutting. Finally, the findings may be used by policymakers, trade unionists and senior managers within emerging economies, and the toolkit may serve to promote better monitoring of work and employment practices down the supply chain.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CDE3F58-B259-44C3-A39B-DAE898E72D77</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d42f8549fba8.78637134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sca-emp.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>MSc Course for Postgraduate Students- SUMS</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>452A06C6-AE3B-4243-93FC-7E0A59009E87</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d42234bfefe2.83869704</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SCA-Emp toolkit Influence on HR practices and company strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>South America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>072CD45C-F2DF-49CA-B0CB-BD8018607E81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Companies have been downloading the SCA-Emp toolkit.
