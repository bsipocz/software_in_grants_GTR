The main aim is to: exploit sources of recessive eIF4E-based resistance to potyviruses in these plants. The involvement of the plant gene eIF4E in the life-cycle of viruses was first discovered in experiments on Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, a potyvirus) and Arabidopsis. Subsequently it was found that the genes eIF4E or its isoform (eIF(iso)4E) are responsible for natural resistance to potyviruses in a range of crop types. The basis of the resistance is that potyviruses require one of these genes in order to complete their life-cycle. It is known that plants with specific alterations in these genes that affect the binding between the plant protein it codes and a viral protein (VPg) are resistant to infection. We have shown that eIF4E is associated with resistance to potyviruses in brassica and barley. The resistances described so far in other plant types involving eIF4E alone are not effective against all strains of the particular potyvirus. However, we have shown that in a brassica, eIF4E in combination with another gene (retr01), confers resistance against all strains of the potyvirus (TuMV). Other genes are involved in the interaction between the viral VPg protein and eIF4E, these include a the very similar gene eIF(iso)4E and other associated genes (eIF4G, eIF4A and isoforms of these). By studying the natural variation in the eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E genes from resistant and susceptible Brassica rapa and barley lines we aim to find new sources of resistance and understand the mechanism of the resistance. We will screen a collection of plants representing 95% of the genetic variation available within the brassica species and a barley diversity panel consisting of up to 800 landraces. Those plants that differ within the eIF4E gene will be tested with informative isolates of the potyviruses to check for resistance/susceptibility. Any eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E variants conferring resistance will be sequenced. This will be supported by looking at plants that have been mutated with chemicals to identify other novel changes in eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E alleles. Lines with such changes will be tested for resistance to a panel of BaMMV and BaYMV isolates. The aim is to identify forms of eIF4E that confer resistance that is durable to all (or most) virus isolates. Using the crystal structures available for eIF4E a model will be generated for eIF4E from barley and B. rapa. Natural and chemically-induced changes in the building blocks (amino acids) of the eIF4E associated with virus resistance in barley and B. rapa will be mapped on the 3D model of the normal eIF4E proteins. The effect of the changes on the potential ability of barley and B. rapa eIF4E to bind to the viral VPg protein will then be investigated. The outcome of this work will be the prediction of superior resistance genes of barley and B. rapa eIF4E for deployment in breeding. A gene retr01 which in combination with eIF4E confers the broad-spectrum resistance to TuMV in B. rapa will be fine mapped to identify the gene's position in the plant genome. The sequence of the gene will be used to search databases to predict its function, understand the mechanism of the broad-spectrum resistance and how retr01 might interact with eIF4E. Based on the best sources of virus resistance in brassicas and barley, changes associated with the genes conferring resistance will be used to design assays which can be used by breeders to incorporate the resistances into their elite breeding stocks by normal breeding methods (crossing). The project will provide an understanding of the scientific basis of the broad-spectrum resistance. Once the mechanism is understood it should be possible to deploy such resistance in a wide range of economically important crop species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Potyviridae is the largest family of plant viruses in the world and cause some of the most important virus diseases of crops in the world. Plant resistance to viruses is the only reliable and sustainable means of control. Potyviruses seem to require the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E plant gene) for successful multiplication in the host. Incompatibility between variants of eIF4E genes and the potyvirus VPg has been found to be the basis of natural resistance to potyviruses in several species. eIF4E-based resistance is frequently strain-specific. This project aims to look for natural allelic variation in eIF4Ee within brassica and barley. Chemically induced allelic variants of eIF4E identified using barley TILLING populations currently available will increase the likelihood of finding novel variants capable of conferring resistance to potyviruses. Using these approaches and through modelling the likely effect of the different alleles on the known binding sites within the protein from both monocots and dicots we aim to identify and predict those likely to confer resistance to resistance breaking strains of the potyviruses. Other genes have been identified that have a role in the eukaryotic initiation complex (EIC) including eIF(iso)4E which has also been shown to be capable of conferring resistance. Allelic variation and possible associated resistance in this gene will also be investigated. In B. rapa we have already mapped a second gene (retr01) which with eIF4Ee confers broad-spectrum resistance to TuMV. This presents the opportunity to develop more durable resistance. By identifying this gene we will be able to determine if it is involved in the EIC and whether it interacts with eIF4Ee to confer broad-spectrum resistance. Discovery of the gene/s underlying broad-spectrum potyvirus resistance associated with eIF4E and markers for these provides the exciting possibility of developing durable potyvirus resistance in a wide range of crops.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>307074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Syngenta</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Syngenta CASE studentship</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B0491CF-3B42-4A17-A872-CFB90743D21A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Identity of gene involved in broad-spectrum disease resistance</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d758d03f4773.84762274-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Plant lines for crossing to and molecular marker services</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>PhD studentship outputs</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Syngenta</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Syngenta material purchase</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E249580-0E95-4E0A-816A-998EE57ADBB6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reported eslsewhere in Researchfish</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d759db01f863.31244211-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>A route to exploitation / commercialisation</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provided plant germplasm with broad-spectrum disease resistance</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Advances in Plant Virology conference (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>499D6747-D3B7-4EFA-BA47-A277965E9D9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster presented by Brazilian collaborator Dr Marcelo Eiras at this international conference focussed on advances in virus research at which I was a member of the organising committee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c920b2017b90.10240293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aab.org.uk/images/virology_2016_ann_pbf.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CSI dissemination / publicity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F02B09D0-7890-4CED-95EE-67B1943AD63D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Radio 4's Science programme 'Material World' with Quentin Cooper:

The University of Warwick, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Syngenta Seeds team report their finding in The Plant Journal.

Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) can infect all kinds of plants, including oilseed rape, peas, cabbages, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, turnips, radish and cauliflower; it causes significant damage and losses to crops. TuMV is a member of the largest taxonomic group of plant viruses causing major diseases in most crop plants and hence the discovery has tremendous generic relevance.
In their paper the researchers have unravelled the mechanism behind a novel broad-spectrum, recessive and potentially durable resistance to the virus and identified the gene involved.

The resistance, which arises from a particular form of a gene called eIF4E, has been shown to be effective against different strains of TuMV from across the world. 

The University of Warwick has patented the generic resistance mechanism; Syngenta Seeds have purchased the generic patent and are currently introducing the resistance gene into commercial varieties of brassicas via a breeding programme. The breeding programme has been speeded up dramatically by the identification of the gene at Warwick, this has allowed Syngenta to use marker-assisted selection for the gene. Pre-commercial field trials are planned for 2016.
Lead investigator Dr John Walsh, from the University of Warwick, said: &amp;quot;This is the culmination of careful and detailed research built on in depth knowledge of the virus and its interactions with brassica plants. The research programme has involved collaborations with valued colleagues at the University of Warwick, particularly Dr Guy Barker, Dr Carol Jenner and Jay Moore, and colleagues in Canada, China, Taiwan, Japan, Holland and Spain, culminating with BBSRC-funded, Warwick PhD student Charlotte Nellist completing the final piece of the jigsaw. 
&amp;quot;The nature and mechanism of the resistance suggests that unlike many forms of plant resistance to disease, this particular resistance has the potential to be durable.&amp;quot;
