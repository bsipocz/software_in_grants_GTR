This addresses an issue of high interest to the country's policymakers. 

Effective interaction and engagement between the health service users and practitioners and policymakers is an important attribute of responsive health systems. Central to this concept is the opportunity for users to provide feedback on their experiences engaging with the health system, and vitally the ability of the health system to respond to users' suggestions. 

This project focuses on Bangladesh, a low income Asian country where the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is implementing a program allowing service users to send feedback via SMS texts. The texts from the whole country are aggregated in a web portal, which is monitored by the MOHFW staff, who are then expected to follow up each issue with both a sender and local authorities. Service users can also provide feedback directly to health management committees at Upazila level, and through suggestion boxes in each health facility. However, it is unclear how issues received directly at the Upazila level are followed-up and by whom. .

The AIM of this project is to assist the policymakers in designing a comprehensive health systems intervention to make Bangladesh's health system more responsive. Specific project OBJECTIVES are to work closely with national and local decision-makers to:
1. Develop an in-depth understanding of the nature and contents of, and key reasons for, feedback received from health service users at Upazila level;
2. Analyse the processes of collecting and responding to service users' feedback at Upazila level, as well as the key contextual facilitators and constraints influencing these processes;
3. Assess the approach to, and processes of, service quality assurance and human resource management, focusing specifically on the use of feedback from service users at Upazila level; 
4. Using results of objectives 1-3, develop a comprehensive health systems intervention to improve the use of feedback from service users in quality assurance and human resource management processes at Upazila level.

This 18-months project will analyse the national-level user feedback data and collect more detailed qualitative information in one district in Bangladesh. Within the district, we will focus on two Upazila Health Complexes (UHC) which, being the first level referral services from the primary health care, are the backbone of the health system.

We will implement a multi-method health systems research using realist evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected using combinations of: 
1) in-depth interviews with purposefully-identified service users and gender and age-specific focus groups with communities to explore their knowledge of and use of feedback systems; 
2) in-depth interviews to explore views of purposefully-selected service providers and managers at the UHC about the user feedback systems; 
3) analysis of country-level secondary data on user feedback from the government web portal, to understand types of issues, their location and gender and age of users who initiated issues; 
4) non-participant observation of: feedback environment in the district, health management committee meetings and UHC routine quality assurance and staff management practices; 
5) review of key documents (e.g. feedback to users and actions taken, meeting minutes, quality assurance guidelines, staff performance appraisal and supervision records). 

Throughout the project, we will work closely with decision-makers, to facilitate the shared understanding, adoption of results into policy and practice and achieving its highest impact. Project results will be communicated widely through policy briefs, presentations at management meetings, development of newsletters and press-releases, to ensure their uptake in policy and practice in Bangladesh and wider.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The AIM of this project is to assist the policymakers in designing a comprehensive health systems intervention to make the Bangladesh's health system more responsive.

- improvements in the user feedback system, enhancing the responsiveness of Bangladesh's health system and further empowering the public to hold health system to account;
- development of expertise in how to advise policy-makers and practitioners on the development and implementation of context-specific comprehensive health systems intervention;
- utilisation of an innovative cross-disciplinary approach to assess the effectiveness of a complex intervention;
- capacity strengthening and use of an innovative research approach in one of the world's most densely populated countries;
- scientific advancement of theories on how to make health systems more responsive in the context of low- income countries.

The main beneficiaries are: 
- Policy-makers and implementers at Upazila, District, Division, National, Asian and Global levels responsible for the development and implementation of policies and systems concerning user feedback, quality of care and human resource management 
- Bangladesh's public and private service providers and practitioners
- Local, national and international civil society organisations and user associations with interest in advocacy and social accountability of the health systems
- National and international academia interested in health systems and policy research and evaluation of complex interventions using robust methodologies
- Local, national and international media with a focus on health and social issues. 

The economic and societal impact will be generated through the following benefits:

1) Improved policymaking. 
Bangladesh's policymakers will be provided with clear and robust results of analysis of the current system to collect and respond to user feedback. This will enable them to make informed decisions about the future implementation of the government SMS programme and future similar initiatives.
The comparative and in-depth analysis will equip policy-makers with a clear understanding of what works for whom and under what circumstances. It will allow further strengthening of the programme in other parts of the country.

2) Improved policy implementation 
Bangladesh's policy implementers at all levels will improve their understanding of how to enhance the performance of the system to collect and respond to user feedback. 
The research will inform the need, and possible paths, for a change in culture and practices within health facilities to improve the utilisation of the user-supplied information in improving quality of health services and improvement in human resource planning and management processes.
The research results will increase the public awareness in Bangladesh, and other similar countries, on how to improve accountability within national health systems. This information will be taken up by local, national and international by civil society organisations, user associations and media groups. 

3) Improved health systems
The research will inform the development of responsive health system in Bangladesh, and in other low and middle income countries. This will be achieved through the initial strengthening of the user feedback system and its subsequent integration with quality assurance and human resource management.
International and national policymakers will be able to use the evidence for health systems strengthening through evidence-informed user feedback programme in Bangladesh and an improved understanding of the context-dependency of implementation of this complex intervention.

4) Improved health outcomes
Health service users in Bangladesh, specifically marginalised groups such as women with compounded effects of vulnerability (poverty, education, region, religion and ethnicity) will benefit from participation in research to gain improved awareness of feedback processes which in turn will raise their engagement with health systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E585F6C-E3F7-41BD-861E-92620B8807FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protocol for a mixed-methods realist evaluation of a health service user feedback system in Bangladesh.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ open</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/55a8ef6bfd4ead438505d17848119ee0"><gtr:id>55a8ef6bfd4ead438505d17848119ee0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ebenso B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2044-6055</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa01d37093ef4.59853427</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B57F872-E956-491A-B319-20E540132245</gtr:id><gtr:title>What is health systems responsiveness?
