Advances in simulation, modelling and data analysis techniques, combined with ever more powerful computing hardware resources, offer a variety of new opportunities to scientists and researchers. However, building and using complex computational science codes continues to be a challenging process. Many computational developers will probably say that developing code to make effective use of modern infrastructure and supporting their end-users who want to run this code on such infrastructure are some of the key difficulties that they face. Building and maintaining a strong base of evolving technical skills and knowledge can help to address such challenges but the sheer volume of different technologies, libraries, tools and applications that developers have to contend with means that being part of a strong and sustainable community of peers can offer valuable support.

This fellowship will undertake a programme of software development, community building and support for computational research to enable and drive the development of a strong community of RSEs at Imperial College London and contribute outputs back into the wider UK RSE community. Working alongside recently established Research Computing Services and emerging RSE support activities and provision currently being developed at Imperial, the fellowship will lead to strong impacts in the way that scientists and researchers make use of software engineering in their research. The work programme will take a &amp;quot;hub and spoke&amp;quot; approach to managing and developing RSE capabilities. A set of core activities, representing the spokes, will feed into a core RSE &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; that will build a base of RSE knowledge, skills and experience within Imperial College, and feed outputs back to the UK RSE community and RSE Network. This will assist in growing this valuable community resource, attracting new members and gaining a stronger understanding of the real-world benefits that it provides.

The software engineering aspect of the fellowship will be undertaken in collaboration with scientists and researchers in two domains - simulation methods and biomedical research. This programme of software development will build on previous collaborations, applying RSE expertise to address the aforementioned challenges of providing easier access to complex computational codes and processes for end-users, and simplifying deployment of analysis processes to a range of computing infrastructure. The community building aspect of the fellowship will support a range of activities expanding the base of RSE expertise and the community structure at Imperial. Collaboration with regional RSE groups will support the building of a regional community of RSEs with an annual, London-based workshop at its core. The model for setting up and running such a community will be refined and contributed back into the UK RSE community with a view to supporting the development of such regional groups in other geographic areas. Evaluation of the sustainability of software outputs and aspects of the event and seminar programme will be undertaken in collaboration with the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI). A further element of the fellowship will be the undertaking of an economic analysis exercise with the aim of gaining an understanding of the costs and benefits of RSE approaches to software development when compared to approaches traditionally followed by research groups. This has the potential for major impact through a much greater understanding of when, where and how RSE is most practical and effective.

It is believed that this fellowship stands to offer transformative, wide-reaching impacts in extending the opportunities available to RSEs and helping to further grow the UK RSE community, in addition to supporting the development of strong, sustainable and successful RSE activities within Imperial College London.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The RSE fellowship programme offers substantial scope for providing strong impacts in a series of different domains and benefitting a range of individuals with varying profiles and expertise. These impacts will include a number of technical and societal impacts. Technical impacts will stem from enhanced software development processes and the building of new software and tools that offer improved capabilities, maintainability and sustainability. Technical events, training and networking will also support technical impact from this work. Societal impacts will result from enhanced communities providing new opportunities for RSEs, and benefits that stem from new and improved software, offering substantial improvements in the research outcomes and the impacts that follow from this.

The groups of individuals who stand to benefit from this fellowship include: RSEs; RSE managers; the UK RSE Community and Network; computational science, engineering and medical researchers; users of computational science and engineering codes and processes in research and industry settings; a wider community of software professionals in academia and industry.

RSEs, RSE managers and their teams will benefit from the strong and wide-ranging community building aspects of the fellowship programme. The requirements and opportunities for applying RSE expertise are continuing to grow rapidly and by developing sustainable and active communities around these individuals, they will see benefits in terms of personal and professional development, and in enhancing their skills and expertise in key technical and scientific areas. In particular, the plan to build a regional community in London and the South East will offer a case study of the process of setting up and maintaining such a community. It will also provide a blueprint for setting up these communities in other geographical regions. This information will be contributed back to the UK RSE community and RSE Network with a view to them helping to develop wider impact by supporting the development of regional communities elsewhere in the UK.

The target communities for the software engineering aspect of the fellowship stand to benefit through their codes being made more reliable, maintainable and accessible. Impact in additional communities will be achieved through community engagement, network building and dissemination. This will enable research teams to support larger user communities with the resources currently available to them. The development of tools and user interfaces to offer easier access to complex computational codes for end-users will further help to grow the user base of applications. For example, it will facilitate access by users who would previously have avoided an application because they don't have the necessary technical knowledge to build the application from source code and deploy and work with it, even though they posses the domain knowledge to understand the computations that they want to undertake and how to define them. The release of generic, open-source tooling through platforms like GitHub, or as web-based services, will lead to impact not only within the academic domain but potentially amongst wider groups of users, including in industry.

The economic analysis aspect of the fellowship aims to gather a greater understanding of the costs and benefits of RSE as opposed to traditional software development approaches in research. The outputs from this exercise offer the potential for very substantial impact since in addition to supporting the UK RSE community, they will provide information that may help to stimulate the development of more RSE groups at institutions around the UK. This would ultimately offer self-sustaining impact since the development of more RSE groups will strengthen the UK RSE community as a whole and offer more opportunities for career development and progression for RSEs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2023-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>639259</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R025460/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1F190F7B-B800-40B2-B250-62AD4842598F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioinformatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
