people-centred health systems research methodology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/N005597/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Recent estimates suggest that two-thirds of the world's deaths pass unrecorded. This situation seriously limits the ability of health systems to respond to the needs of vulnerable and excluded populations. Developing methods to reliably understand why people die in populations with weak health systems is therefore an important strategy for saving lives. 

Registering medical cause of death has long been considered essential for public health. Despite increasing globalisation, in many resource-poor countries, universal registration of vital events remains lacking and uncertain estimates provide an inadequate basis for policy and planning. In addition, the social inequalities and social contexts play an important role in shaping health for disadvantaged groups. Even with the data available, insufficient attention is paid to the root causes of mortality in resource poor settings.

Considering these factors, there is an urgent need to improve health information about and for marginalised populations to inform public health responses. The proposed research will develop an extension to an established method called Verbal Autopsy (VA). VA is used to measure the levels and causes of death in populations where large numbers die outside health facilities or without registration. The development will help local health systems to assess their own health situations, identify priorities and develop action plans for positive health change. 

We will do this through three phases of work. 
- Firstly, we will develop improved ways to classify causes of death by combing information on medical causes with data on the circumstances of deaths (seeking and using care at the time of death). In settings where health services are under-funded, weak and fragmented, these can often play a crucial role. The classifications will also be developed in consultation with local health planners to be of practical use.
- Secondly, we will develop an additional method to gain the views of local communities on long-standing health challenges. This will allow us to further understand how social, economic and health systems issues influence availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care. The method may also help foster social inclusion in health. 
- In the final phase, we will consult with higher levels of the health system about the method. This will help develop how we use the extended cause of death classifications combined with community knowledge. The aim here is to explore how the method could be used in an ongoing fashion to connect health surveillance to service organisation in an inclusive process. This approach encourages sustainable health gains.

Data, poverty and inequality exist in complex co-dependency: less data exist on the health of the poor than the rich, raising important questions about the relationship between material and data poverty. In settings where health systems are fragile and under-resourced, where new burdens of disease are rapidly emerging, and where large and diverse populations are excluded from access to health care, innovative approaches that connect the registration of vital events to health care systems in a people-centred approach are needed. 

The approach employs a bottom up philosophy connecting with population data at source. In the longer term, it is envisaged that the method will contribute to more rigorous health data at population level in an inclusive process that can affect sustainable health gains through better data and improved capacity for evaluation. 

The work will be conducted in an research centre in rural South Africa established for over 20 years. The extent of data available and the richness of experience in health research allows us to develop a method with partners who enact a broader commitment to registration of all individuals within a population.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>People-centred health systems (PCHS) is a recent progressive shift that has moved thinking beyond building-blocks models of health systems towards ones that centralise a human and relational nature. Despite the conceptual advance, empirical methods are lacking. The project seeks to develop methods for conducing and using Verbal Autopsy (VA) consistent with a PCHS approach by combining VA with Participatory Action Research (PAR) in a process connected to the health system at different levels. VA is a health surveillance technique that provides information on levels and causes of mortality in populations where deaths occur outside facilities and/or without registration. PAR is a process that aims to transform the roles of those participating from objects of research to active researchers and agents of change. It systematises local experience through collective analysis to generate valid forms of evidence on the relationships between health problems and their causes. Three phases of research are proposed. In Phase 1, we will conduct a secondary analysis of data gained through the application of the 2012 WHO VA standard in a Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) in rural South Africa. Combing data on medical causes with new data on background characteristics of deaths, we will develop improved ways to classify causes in a method suitable for use at sub-district/district level. In Phase 2, local service users and providers will engage in a PAR process to review the results of Phase 1, set priorities for local services, and explore the potential for co-benefits related to empowerment and social inclusion. The final Phase 3 aims to consult at higher levels of the health system to consider how the method could be further applied and evaluated. The overall output is a practical and integrated methodology based on core standards that is contextually relevant and capable of affecting health gains by translating local priorities into actionable public health agendas.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ultimate beneficiaries of the proposed research are populations in which large numbers die outside health facilities and/or without proper registration. Estimates suggest that over two thirds of deaths worldwide pass without registration of cause, with over three quarters of these in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Fragilities in health systems are exacerbated by poor civil registration and vital statistics systems (CRVS): without an understanding of the situations of poor, marginalised and excluded groups, the problems they face can neither be identified nor addressed. In this context there is an urgent need to improve health information about marginalised populations. 

The research is also intended to have a positive impact on local communities, policy-makers and health planners within national, provincial, district and sub-district health offices. Information on cause-specific disease profiles, their health systems and social determinants, and priorities for actionable public health agendas will have been rigorously verified at local community and systems levels. Co-constructed practical knowledge will be thoroughly embedded in, and thus relevant to, local health systems contexts. These outputs will be disseminated in local communities and to health authorities to investigate their validity and relevance, and to reflect on the method as a means of sustainable and self-administered evaluation and planning. 

In addition, the research responds to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s current effort to develop CRVS systems in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). The proposed research will provide the piloted VA-PAR method promoting democratic knowledge production, capacity building and evidence-based advocacy. In this sense, the research is also intended to provide important information for WHO on the adaption of VA-based models as a medium term strategy towards universal vital registration. To enable these impacts, methodological and technical discussions on a) extended biosocial classifications for unregistered deaths and b) the explanatory potential of routine participatory adjuncts in health and demographic surveillance will be conducted with WHO. We will hold dissemination workshops with WHO in which the methods will be discussed in terms of the potential for sustainable and self-administered evaluation and planning.

The Development Grant work also aims to facilitate further application and evaluation of the method among wider audiences. We therefore propose to hold two further workshops in South Africa and the UK to engage with academic and non-academic audiences on further application and evaluation of the method. Firstly, with the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH), a southern-based, southern-led umbrella organisation of 50 independent health research centres that operate 48 HDSS sites in 20 LMICs (http://www.indepth-network.org). The meeting will consider how and for whose purposes health information is generated for sustainable action towards improved health outcomes. This workshop will also explore the potential to create further spaces for application and evaluation of the method. Secondly, in the UK through the Public Engagement in Research Unit (PERU) at the University of Aberdeen (http://www.abdn.ac.uk/engage/), we will conduct a national workshop on the relationships between material and data poverty, and on methods and opportunities for generating routine people-centred health information. Here we will also explore further application and evaluation of the method to enable the impacts envisaged.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Statistics South Africa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Statistics South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:id>D9489175-4ABF-476F-A0A7-99D330A3AC17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Technical input</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5835a058528022.24363796-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Technical support</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Through dialogue with co-principal investigators, Statistics South Africa agreed to join the proposal for the scale up of the VAPAR method as Project Partners</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Malaria Consortium Africa, Kampala</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Malaria Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>38FDB4D5-A0CD-45C4-BF7A-24477844514C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference proceedings, commentary in Lancet Global Health</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5835a2b82d70a8.57237638-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Conference presentation, co-authoring Lancet Global Health commentary on VA in health systems</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Conference organisation, co-authoring Lancet Global Health commentary on VA in health systems</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aberdeen City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Aberdeen City Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>116FC750-591A-4B07-A975-4E222EE62242</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Student dissertation: Household food insecurity and food poverty in North East Scotland: a community-based participatory research study.

How should we be doing research with people living in poverty, who are hard to reach, vulnerable, disadvantaged and social excluded? People living in deprived conditions have crucial perspectives on health and social inequalities, and through authentic engagement can provide important evidence for public policy. This seminar brings together researchers working in different world regions to explore how we can do 'people-centred' and 'action-oriented' research on social and health inequalities. By people-centred research, we mean working with and for people who are directly affected by the issues being investigated. By action-oriented, we mean research that is embedded in contexts where knowledge outputs can be acted on for positive change. At the seminar, we will also launch the Centre for Global Development at the University of Aberdeen, a centre of excellence committed to equity, social justice and sustainable futures.

The Minister for Europe and International Development, Humza Yousaf MSP, and officials from the Scottish Government's International Development Team held an event for members of academic institutions with an interest in international development, in order to have a focussed discussion on international development policy. The group that I participated in had a rich discussion about approaches to create spaces for more collaborative research and public engagement within and between Scottish Universities working in global health and development. The recommendations and suggestions were for the creation of a regular forum for HE in global health and development, to prioritise South-South exchanges with research evidence and outputs, consideration of alternative forms of evidence from local knowledge and generated using participatory methodologies, and to prioritise capacity strengthening through technology and social media. Several of these views have developed as a result of the Verbal Autopsy with Participatory Action research (VAPAR) Development Grant work (DFID/MRC/Wellcome Trust/ESRC Health Systems Research Initiative (MR/N005597/1)). And some of the points (on creation of a Scottish HE/GHD forum, on the use of technology and social media and on South-South exchange) were reiterated by the Minister in the closing remarks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1412016e3c5.45846427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/scottish-government-international-development-consultation-academia-event-tickets-21519720062?utm_source=eb_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=reminder_attendees_48hour_email&amp;utm_term=eventname</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Improving data improving health: Verbal Autopsy for health systems strengthening | 17 October 2016 | University College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F07FCCF-8365-44F5-9C12-6F2AD3D1A2EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The VAPAR Development Grant has generated a piloted methodology that promotes democratic knowledge production, capacity building and evidence-based advocacy.

In this sense, the research provides important information for WHO in terms of the adaption of VA-based models for CVRS as a medium term strategy towards universal vital registration. This is a dissemination workshop with WHO with a focus on the methodological results in terms of a) biosocial classification systems for unregistered deaths and b) routine participatory adjuncts for health and demographic surveillance that are considered in the context of this broader methodological transition.

Improving data improving health: Verbal Autopsy for health systems strengthening

The majority of deaths in Africa and Asia are never recorded. Verbal autopsy (VA) is a method to determine causes of death using an interview with witnesses of the death, data from which are interpreted to conclude medical causes. In this seminar, we will reflect on innovations in VA including automated and mobile VA, and examine contextualised approaches to understanding why people die outside facilities or without registration. We will also explore how information from VA can be made available as part of a health systems approach. The aim of the event is to consolidate methods that have the potential to bring together communities and policy makers with better data and improved capacity for evaluation. Join participants from the Information, Evidence and Research Unit at WHO, the Ume&amp;aring; WHO Collaborating Centre for VA, the Malaria Consortium, the Africa Centre, University College London Institute for Global Health and Lancet Global Health.

EventBrite information (for dissemination to health authorities)

The Verbal Autopsy and Participatory Action Research (VAPAR) project has developed a method to connect health authorities, communities and researchers to do partnerships research of mutual benefit. This work has been progressed with the DFID/MRC/ESRC/Wellcome Health Systems Research Initiative and the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance Site of Wits University, Mpumalanga Provincial Department of Health, and the Universities of Aberdeen in Scotland and Umea in Sweden.
 
In VAPAR, researchers, communities and health systems stakeholders worked together to generate evidence on disease profiles levels and causes, their health systems and social determinants, and priorities for action. With a focus on non-academic beneficiaries, these outputs are being disseminated to investigate their relevance, and to reflect on the method as a means of sustainable and self-administered evaluation and planning. The workshop will present three elements of the method for discussion with health systems colleagues.
 
(1) New ways to routinely record and understand deaths investigated in Verbal Autopsy (VA) in related to the circumstances of mortality;
(2) Participatory action research (PAR) as a method to generate evidence with communities on social and health systems avoidable mortality
(3) Working with health systems practitioners to interpret e VA and PAR data, producing actionable public health agendas.
 
The process provided more real data, rigorously validated at community and health systems levels addressing previously unknown issues and developing actionable plans. The method has been appraised as a robust and innovative partnerships approach to collaborative research, and viewed as acceptable and relevant for health systems use. 
 
The workshop will disseminate the methods and findings. The workshop will strengthen partnerships for practical and problem oriented research, provide feedback on policy initiatives at different levels, extend contextually relevant approaches to VA, and continue to engage with communities through PAR.
 
This workshop brings together individuals from academic and non-academic backgrounds to explore methods and opportunities to generate 'people-centred', 'action-oriented' information on health inequalities. By people-centred information, we mean information developed by and for people who are directly affected by the issues being investigated. By action-oriented information, we mean information that is developed for and with, and embedded in, forms of acting upon the information provided.

The main aim is to extend the method into a process to act on the evidence generated. This adds a crucial link that goes beyond the identification of problems and solutions towards action and implementing change.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57d9509d0d5b65.12388278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/health-systems-research-a-partnerships-approach-to-health-in-mpumalanga-tickets-27431058033</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture as part of the Queen Margaret University Grad Challenge Lecture Series at the Institute of Global Health and Development 25th February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93132C45-D75F-4DA4-B99F-E26F1380DA14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25 February 2016 IGHD Grand Challenges Seminar
&amp;quot;WHAT YOU COUNT IS WHAT YOU DO&amp;quot;: COUNTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH ON MATERNAL DEATH AND DISABILITY IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

This talk examines methods to investigate maternal mortality and severe morbidity in resource poor settings. Three applied examples - a practitioner-based confidential enquiry, a verbal autopsy survey, and a community-based review drawn from work in Indonesia, Burkina Faso and South Africa - are presented to illustrate the implications of methodological choices for the evidence base about women, families and communities, and for policy, practice and services.

The course is led by labour economist Professor Ioannis Theodossiou and social scientist Dr Lucia D'Ambruoso as a cross-college collaboration. The course aims to take a global perspective on health policy and systems research (HPSR), providing students with knowledge and understanding of the key characteristics of health policy, health systems, and the contribution of research in this field. The course covers a wide variety of topics including health systems around the world, the effects of social inequalities on health inequalities and their repercussions for social policy, issues of public health policy, and how research can make credible contributions in this context. The principal aims are:
? To introduce different health systems: what they are, how they are defined and financed and to encourage a critical and comparative perspective; 
? To explore health inequalities and health and social policy issues;
? To provide an overview of HPSR.
The course has also been registered with the Health Systems Global Training database. The course has been developed in response to work in the field of Health Policy and Systems Research, which has been through the Verbal Autopsy with Participatory Action Research (VAPAR) methodological development work (DFID/MRC/Wellcome Trust/ESRC Health Systems Research Initiative (MR/N005597/1) ).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56aa47ef8dfdd6.13507631</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.abdn.ac.uk/msc/global-health</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Placement project (n=1) linking University of Aberdeen postgraduate students to MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt), South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B729AF1E-96FD-4A33-88D7-FF3AB49184BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de97d6aa1697.38906681</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Disseration projects (n=2) linking postgraduate students from the University of Aberdeen to MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt), South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08517259-E6D6-478E-A9A9-8E397F288657</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de9813a9eff9.31710191</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The method aims to develop community partnerships to co-construct and act on new knowledge on health in rural settings.

Issues identified include transactional sex, harmful traditional practices, alcohol/substance abuse and debt, compounded by denial of treatment, insensitive staff and poor confidentiality in clinics. Photovoice was also used to explore participatory photography
- Partnerships: the process has been developed with Mpumalanga provincial health authority and local communities in Agincourt. The partnerships are evidenced in a paper, conference abstract and the current application co-authored by health authority representatives and researchers. The health authority also plans to initiate a community health forum responding to needs expressed in the PAR element.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e14d6d02f4e3.85720277</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory Action Research (PAR) to gain local knowledge on health and illness, including Photovoice</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Verbal autopsy (VA) is a health surveillance technique used in low and middle-income countries to determine medical causes of death (CODs) for people who die outside hospitals and/or without registration. By virtue of the deaths it investigates, VA is also an opportunity to examine social exclusion from access to health systems. The aims were to develop a classification system for deaths investigated in VA cognisant of broader social and health systems determinants. A short set of questions on social and health systems circumstances at and around the time of death were developed and integrated into the WHO 2012 short form VA (SF-VA). Data was analysed from two census rounds 2012-13 in the Agincourt HDSS in rural South Africa where the SF-VA had been applied. InterVA-4 was used to develop cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs). Descriptive analyses were performed examining whether and how the new indicators varied by medical conditions and age/sex sub-groups.

The system complements data on medical causes and has identified multiple, reinforcing barriers to access including unaffordable costs, unavailable transport and under-utilisation of facility-based care. Supplementing VA with questions on background circumstances provides complementary information to CSMFs relevant for health planning.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e14c67eb0b05.69096608</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Extending Verbal Autopsy (VA) to Collect Information on Local Circumstances</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57EC3B4A-6F53-4648-96EA-EB04FFA43B5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The case for verbal autopsy in health systems strengthening.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet.
