They proceeded to create some of the most prosperous and powerful states in the ancient Mediterranean world. Yet history of these settlements, at least before the fifth century BC, is poorly understood: literary references at best provide only a skeletal version of the political history of archaic Sicily (8th- 6th centuries) and its social history remains obscured. How did these settlements develop from small foundations to the mighty states of the fifth century? At what stage did their societies crystallise into different social classes and aristocracies? What was their relationship with the Greek 'homeland'? Were their populations made up purely of Greeks or did they co-reside with the indigenous Sikel population? \n\nGiven the paucity of literary accounts, the key to answering these questions and understanding the nature of archaic Sicilian Greek society lies in the archaeological record. Yet past studies of Sicily have made only limited use of this record. Often driven by modern imperialist models which identify similarity and ignore difference, they have viewed the politically independent Sicilian Greek states as inferior, unchanging, culturally dependent on their mother-cities in Greece and as purely Greek, apart from a Sikel slave class. Nostalgic links, it is argued, were maintained through duplicated customs and shared religious festivals.\n\nEssentially, the archaeological record means the burial record: major Greek sites have yielded thousands of graves over more than a century of excavation, while other archaeological contexts (sanctuaries, habitation areas) have produced limited resources. This project aims to understand the archaic Greek settlements of Sicily through their under-utilised funerary evidence. The emergence of a significant body of archaeological mortuary theory in the later twentieth century now enables the graves and their goods to be used to their full potential to examine the social dynamics of the living population.\n\nThis project analyses an extremely large body of data within the framework of these interpretative models. It assesses the extent to which the 'colonies' really did duplicate the customs of their 'mother-cites' and argues that they show considerable independence. The emergence of an aristocratic class by the late seventh century is identified through increasing grave wealth and there is evidence for accelerating competition in funerary display both within and between individual states in the sixth. The usefulness of the funerary record for observing different ethnic elements in the population (especially through intermarriage) is investigated and different strategies for the assertion of ethnic and cultural identities through choice of interment method and grave goods are identified. This project observes periods when the high mortality rate of young children is grossly under-represented and explores the possibility of deliberate exclusion on grounds of social rank. Topographic study indicates that conspicuous grave position and grave plotting was critical to the assertion of social status. Comparisons with sanctuary evidence indicate that votive dedications and temple building also reflect competing social groups and the assertion of new cultural identities. \n\nThis research argues that the archaeological evidence points to a very different view of archaic Greek Sicily from that which has been postulated in the past: rather than being inferior and culturally dependent, these states used material culture to assert new, independent ethnic and cultural identities; they underwent rapid social change over a period of c. 200 years; and they employed their material culture and visual media to assert their status as major players in the ancient world. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24194</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004591/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
