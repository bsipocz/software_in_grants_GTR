Mathematical physics was always producing a wide variety of new concepts and problems that became important subjects of the pure mathematical research. The growth of gauge, gravity and string theories have made the relation between these subjects closer than ever before. An important driving force was the discovery of quantum groups and of the gauge/gravity dualities. Here the leading role was played by the the so-called AdS/CFT duality and the underlying integrable structure of it.

A far-reaching concept is the effect of boundaries and the corresponding boundary conditions. They are unavoidable in almost all models of mathematical physics and are of the fundamental importance. The introduction of boundaries into the theory of quantum groups leads to a whole new class of the so-called reflection algebras. Such algebras were shown to appear in numerous mathematical models and are at the core of the integrable structure of them. Furthermore, these algebras were also shown to play a prominent role in the AdS/CFT. However a coherent framework for describing such algebras is not known, and many properties of the reflection algebras are still an open question.

The goal of this research is to develop new algebraic methods and intradisciplinary connections between the axiomatic theory of algebras and the theory of quantum groups inspired by the integrable structure of the AdS/CFT, in particular by shedding more light on the effects of boundaries and different boundary configurations. The research is driven by applying algebraic objects such as the quantum affine and Yangian algebras to find elegant, exact solutions describing the models that arise from and are inspired by the gauge/gravity dualities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many algebraic structures which have been hot topics of research for algebraists during the recent years - quantum groups, Yangians, Kac-Moody and W -algebras (affine and finite) - were discovered in conformal field theory and integrable systems. It is highly likely that the new structures now being revealed in the gauge/gravity dualities will prove similarly mathematically fruitful and will fuel a long-term impact on quantum algebras and their representation theory, and the exploration of various non-linear systems.

The academic impact in the area of mathematical physics is foreseen via the collaboration of PDRF (Post-Doctoral Research Fellow) with A. Torrielli (Surrey) and post-docs M. de Leeuw (ETZ Zurich) and T. Matsumoto (Sydney); in the area of algebra via the collaboration with S. Kolb (Newcastle). The PDRF will also seek for points of common interest with mathematical physicists D. Correa (Fisica La Plata), T. Hollowood (Swansea), B. Stefanski (City U. London), C. Young (Hertfordshire). This project is closely related to the research done by algebraists N. Guay and X. Ma (Alberta), and to the research activities of the Mathematical Physics group of Laboratoire d'Annecy-le-Vieux. The other academics which work at the intersection of mathematical physics and algebra and whose research interests overlap with this project are S. Belliard, N. Crampe (Laboratoire Charles Coulomb), A. Doikou (Patras) and P. Baseilhac (TOURS). They are working in the area of the reflection algebras, thus the results of this project will have a direct impact on their research. PDRF will look for opportunities to interact with these academics and will search for common lines of research interests.

PDRF aims to organize two three-day workshops `New prospects in quantum groups' during the first and the third year of the fellowship. These workshops would bring together young researchers and established academics from across the UK working in different branches on mathematics that are tightly connected with the theory of quantum groups. It would be an excellent opportunity to generate new ideas and to spread the results of this project to a wider academic community and also would serve to the community itself as a great chance to envision and make new intradisciplinary connections. These workshops will be the continuation of the recent conference `Future directions for quantum groups' which took place at Lancaster University and was a part of the ARTIN (Algebra and Representation Theory in the North) meetings. In such a way the proposed workshops would serve as the beginning of an analogue series of meetings in the South of England. It is important to note that a closely related series of NBMPS (North British Mathematical Physics Seminar) also has no analogue in the South. Another related event is the `Recent Advances in Quantum Integrable Systems' meeting which is held every two years in France and attains a wide local and international attention.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221071</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop (Pisa)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B1691B4D-682E-409E-86C0-C5011E053D87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I attended the workshop `Vertex algebras, W-algebras, and applications' which was one of the three main activities of the INdAM Intensive Period - FIRB Project `Perspectives in Lie Theory' at Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi.

We established a connection between these new quantum groups and the Olshanskii twisted Yangians and Molev-Ragoucy reflection algebras by showing isomorphism between these quantum groups when the rank is small. We have also studied representation theory of the extended twisted Yangians.
2) We obtained algebra closure relations for the so-called MacKay twisted Yangians formulated in Drinfeld original presentation of Yangians.
3) We have constructed fused boundary operators for arbitrary representations in the Baxterized affine Hecke algebra and showed links with the theory of quantum integrable models.
4) We studied quantum symmetric Kac-Moody pairs for untwisted affine Lie algebras of classical type and obtained a classification of trigonometric reflection matrices that are solutions of the Sklyanin's reflection equation and are in one-to-one correspondence with aforementioned Kac-Moody pairs. We have generalized the notion of Satake diagrams by introducing a notion of weak Satake diagrams. We demonstrated that these can be used to describe more general, quantum Kac-Moody pair algebras and found the associated reflection matrices.
5) We studied algebraic properties of the generalized Hubbard model and demonstrated that the Yangian algebra found by Korepin and Uglov can be viewed a certain specialization of the AdS5/CFT4 Yangian algebra introduced by Beisert. We also demonstrated that Hubbard Hamiltonian corresponds to a certain specialization of the so-called secret symmetry operator.
6) We introduced a deformed Yangian algebra whose highest-weight representations describe excitations of closed spin chains in the AdS3/CFT2 duality. We showed that the AdS3/CFT2 wordsheet R-matrix admits an elegant trigonometric parametrization and depends on three individual parameters associated with masses and momenta of the spin chain excitations.
7) We studied giant gravitons and open spin chains in the AdS3/CFT2 duality. We showed that certain giant gravitons admit integrable structures that are similar to those appearing in the AdS5/CFT4 duality.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings show a concrete previously unexplored direction of research in the theory of coideal quantum algebras with a wide spectrum of applications both in mathematics and physics. 
Moreover, the quantum effects are starting to play an important role in contemporary electronics due to constantly increasing density of semiconductor manufacturing processes. It is reasonable to expect that coideal quantum algebras might start playing a role in designing semiconductors of the next generation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49951FE3-DC73-458C-9F61-F92984DC12DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545ddf042110d7.30250379</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7ABC81F8-82B8-4ACA-883A-3B42E6ADCE9D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Equivalences between three presentations of orthogonal and symplectic Yangians</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8af409d7c1bd63ec0bf0f4362b14236b"><gtr:id>8af409d7c1bd63ec0bf0f4362b14236b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guay Nicolas</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9c219d469561.95443972</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>86ED9C87-28B7-4ACF-BF07-3C50AF22AB1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representations of twisted Yangians of types B, C, D: I</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Selecta Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b7260087977ad5831d9f2f4142dd4b04"><gtr:id>b7260087977ad5831d9f2f4142dd4b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guay N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd40ba921ac0.72182097</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F2BE5C6-2C24-457D-8C1C-E174F84334C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Yangian of</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Geometry and Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da1aa874ef81c88393a19e2c0715f5aa"><gtr:id>da1aa874ef81c88393a19e2c0715f5aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Regelskis V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>03930440</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9c20f3e517d7.05370563</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0E2A69CF-9FEC-4C9C-9EC1-156638B85C3F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Twisted Yangians for symmetric pairs of types B, C, D</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematische Zeitschrift</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b7260087977ad5831d9f2f4142dd4b04"><gtr:id>b7260087977ad5831d9f2f4142dd4b04</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guay N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd40bacb7928.58362001</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>87B7995F-7F6C-4931-882E-3ABA7D496318</gtr:id><gtr:title>Integrable open spin-chains in
