Some treatments may be beneficial but this largely depends on a patient?s ability to participate actively in repetitive practice of everyday (functional) tasks. Patients with substantial weakness may not be able to do this. The present study will investigate whether a new therapy (functional strength training - FST) can reduce weakness and thereby enhance outcome. We propose a two-group clinical trial in 3 stroke rehabilitation services. All 288 participants will receive standardised conventional physical therapy (CPT). In addition they will be randomly allocated to receive either FST or extra CPT. The measures of clinical outcome that will be used to compare the effects of the two additional therapies will be: the ability to use the weaker arm and hand for functional tasks such as lifting a pencil and the ability to produce voluntary contraction of weak muscles against resistance. These measures will be made before treatment begins, after 6 weeks of treatment, and at 6 months after the stroke. The trial is designed to find whether the benefits of FST justify a subsequent large scale trial. Embedded in the trial are measures which aim to increase understanding of how the central nervous system (CNS) recovers after stroke. We know that CNS recovery involves reorganisation of nerve networks in the brain and spinal cord. We do not yet know how to use physical therapies to encourage beneficial reorganisation to improve outcomes after stroke. We also do not know which stroke survivors should receive which physical therapies. To answer these questions we will combine: brain imaging to define the extent of damage and the brain activity during hand movement; and magnetic brain stimulation to measure how well the brain is connected to weakened muscles of the affected arm and hand. We will then be able to find out how the biological mechanisms underpinning arm use change over time after stroke in the two groups of participants and whether these changes are associated with improvements in ability to perform everyday tasks. The trial will only begin when NHS ethical approval has been granted. Every person recruited as a participant will first be required to provide informed consent. No routine treatment will be withheld from participants in this clinical trial. The trial team have considerable expertise in stroke rehabilitation research. The team is multidisciplinary with expertise including neurology, physiotherapy, neuroimaging, statistics and user involvement. The funding requested is for experienced therapists to deliver the interventions, a research assessor in each centre who does not know what treatment people received so that measures are 'blinded' and the neurological investigations (neuroimaging, neurophysiology). In addition we have costed for travel for participants to attend for treatment and measurement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>HYPOTHESIS: Functional Strength Training plus conventional physical therapy (FST+CPT) enhances upper limb motor recovery early after stroke more than CPT+CPT. AIMS: to determine: the relative efficacy of FST+CPT and CPT+CPT; the neural correlates of improvement in response to FST+CPT and CPT+CPT; whether any one or combination of baseline measures predict improvement in motor function in response to FST+CPT or CPT+CPT; and estimate of cost-effectiveness to inform a subsequent definitive clinical trial. DESIGN: randomized, controlled, observer-blind, 2-group multi-centre efficacy trial with embedded explanatory measures. POPULATION: adults 14-60 days after stroke with upper limb paresis. INTERVENTIONS: protocol-driven CPT emphasises a therapist facilitating movement (therapist-dependent) whereas FST involves repetitive progressive resisted exercise during goal-directed functional activity (therapist-independent). All participants will receive the routine amount of CPT delivered by clinical therapists. Experimental FST and CPT will be delivered by different research therapists for 1.5 hours a day for 6 weeks. OUTCOMES: primary efficacy measure is change in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) from pre-treatment (baseline) to post-treatment (outcome). Explanatory measures include: voxel-wise estimates of brain activity during hand movement; brain white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy); and brain-muscle connectivity (e.g. latency of motor evoked potentials). ASSESSMENTS: will be conducted by an assessor blinded to group allocation at baseline, outcome and at 6 months after stroke (follow-up). SAMPLE SIZE: is based on actual ARAT data from our previous early phase trial. A sample size of 129 per group would have 80% power to detect a clinically important difference of 6 points in ARAT change using a 2-sample t-test with a 5% 2-sided significance level. Anticipating an attrition rate of 10% at outcome a total of 288 participants will be randomized. ANALYSIS: will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary clinical efficacy analysis will compare continuous outcome variables between treatment groups using a normal multilevel model. Therapist will be included in the model as a zero-mean random effect. Effect of treatment will be summarised using the adjusted mean difference and 95% confidence interval. To identify the neural correlates of motor improvement in both groups we will investigate associations between change from baseline in clinical outcomes and each explanatory measure. We will adjust for the variables used in randomisation. Further exploration will use multilevel linear regression. We will investigate an extension of structural mean models/causal inference as a potential exploratory analysis. To determine whether baseline measurements predict improvement in motor function we will develop a multiple regression model. Principal components analysis will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the predictor variables. ECONOMIC BENEFIT: information on costs and effects will be used to give an indication of the likely cost-effectiveness of FST+CPT. TIMETABLE/RECRUITMENT RATE We anticipate recruiting 5 participants a month a centre for 20 months. Trial set-up needs 4 months, follow-up 6 months and analysis - writeup 6 months.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1146310</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TeleRehab consortium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>778878C2-57BC-47DF-AD43-6E993D5C42A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Valerie Pomeroy led a consortium of nine research partners that submitted an application to the EU Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks.

The workshop enabled dynamic interaction between delegates from: different professional backgrounds, different organisations; and clinical and non-clinical backgrounds. The aims were to:
1. identify the current landscape for linking rehabilitation technology research and practice;
2. ascertain the opportunities within ABIRA to support innovation in rehabilitation technology;
3. determine the actions needed by ABIRA to deliver the development, evaluation and implementation pathway for rehabilitation technology for people with cognitive, communication and/or sensorimotor challenges as a result of an acquired brain injury (ABI)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd69337672f1.24523121</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MP visit to School of Health Sciences</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AA7AFF4-D6AB-410C-96C5-1845E416F3ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>George Freeman MP visit to UEA included a visit to the Movement Exercise laboratory where Prof Valerie Pomeroy showcased the neuro rehabilitation and clinical exercise physiology equipment</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589da943a3f5b0.60686338</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ACPIN-INPA International NeuroPhysiotherapy Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26CCAE2D-1CAD-41D1-905D-E2D7C6DD56D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ACPIN (Association of Chartered Physiotherapists interested in Neurology) collaborated with the International Neuro Physiotherapy Association (INPA/WCPT) to organise the first international neuro physiotherapy conference in London.
