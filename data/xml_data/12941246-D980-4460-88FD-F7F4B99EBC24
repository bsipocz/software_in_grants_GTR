Vocabulary learning is a core part of language development and is characterised as a particularly hard problem: How do children know that the sounds people make with their mouths are 'words' and that they are names for objects, actions or properties? The assumption that words are only arbitrarily linked to objects and actions in the world (i.e., there is nothing in the sound of 'cat' that brings to the mind's eye what a cat looks like, how it moves etc) makes the task of learning words especially hard: how can the correct object be found in a visually cluttered world (when the object is one among many present), or worse, when the object is absent from the immediate environment? We argue that language is, in addition to being indisputably arbitrary, also fundamentally iconic (i.e. maintaining transparent links between spoken form and meaning) and that arbitrariness and iconicity coexist to aid learning in different ways. In particular, iconicity would provide powerful cues to support learning, especially when communication concerns objects and events not visually present, by bringing some of their sensory-motor properties to the mind's eye (e.g., when a caregiver elongates the vowel in &amp;quot;taaall&amp;quot; to refer to a very tall person).

Language has potential for iconicity in different channels of expression. First, iconicity can be found in the phonology of words, e.g. in onomatopoeia such as 'meow' or 'drip'. Moreover, co-speech gestures, hand movements made by speakers can evoke the shape or movement of objects being talked about, and prosody (as in the 'tall' example) both have a high potential for iconic mappings. We ask: (1) Do caregivers use iconicity (in phonology, gestures, and/or prosody) in their input to children? (2) Does iconicity aid children's word learning? (3) Is iconicity especially useful when talking about objects, actions or properties which are absent in immediate environment? These questions are addressed in a complementary series of studies using naturalistic observation, semi-naturalistic methods, and standard experiments that assess iconicity in the speech, gestures, and prosody of caregivers and children aged 2-3 years. We focus on this age as it is a time of remarkable vocabulary growth in which communication is often about things not present in the immediate environment (e.g., happened before), and at which children understand and produce iconic gestures. In Strand 1, we take advantage of Prof. Goldin-Meadow's (University of Chicago) unique corpus of caregiver-child conversations in order to assess the presence of iconic cues in caregivers and their correlation with vocabulary measures taken later in life (at school entry). In Strand 2, we complement this data with collecting a semi-naturalistic audio-visual corpus of caregiver-child interactions in which objects to be talked about are present or not, and these objects may be known to the child or be novel (in order to assess learning for new label-referent pairs). This corpus will be annotated along similar lines as the naturalistic corpus in order to assess the presence of iconicity in caregivers' communication. Finally, in Strand 3 we ask whether iconic cues in the input are causally linked to learning by experimentally manipulating the presence and kind of iconic cues (and the channel in which they occur) in learning novel words. As this research has the potential for important impact on learning and development in the early foundational years, we will actively involve educators and developmental speech-and-language therapists by setting up a researcher-practitioner network to disseminate and discuss implications of research within the community of practitioners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
1. Academic beneficiaries will profit from the proposed research program, as described in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section above. 
2. Parents: Language is primarily learnt in face-to-face contexts in which speech is always accompanied by prosodic modulations and by co-speech gestures. However, we simply do not know how these different channels contribute to children's learning. Despite this lack of knowledge, &amp;quot;baby-sign&amp;quot; programs are enjoying increasing popularity without proper evidence-based for their effectiveness (see Fitzpatrick et al., 2014). Our work will provide first evidence of effectiveness of spontaneous communicative strategies based on gestures, prosody and use of onomatopoeais used by parents. It will therefore bring awareness and insight on how to use these strategies more effectively. 
3. Educators of young children: Early years educators spontaneously gesture with young children, particularly when communicating with a group of children, but at no stage of their training will they have been made consciously aware that they do this (Marshall &amp;amp; Hobsbaum, 2015). As is the case for parents, educators understand the importance of the language development of the children in their care. A better understanding of how gesture and other communicative strategies can support this endeavour will be welcomed by early years educators.
4. Speech and language therapists working with atypically developing children will also find our results of interest as providing a new multimodal window into communication with and by children and also potentially providing new strategies to use with children with speech and language impairments (SLI). 

How will impact be achieved? We propose to use three main pathways to achieving impact during the lifetime of the project:
1. We will disseminate our findings to teachers and parents by giving presentations in nurseries and by writing about the research in magazines which are widely distributed among educators and parents such as &amp;quot;Nursery World&amp;quot; for which the PI has already agreed to write a piece. 
2. We will be embedding research within our teaching - at UCL we train SLTs, at the IOE we train teachers, at both IOE and UCL we train educational psychologists. This gives us a way of immediately disseminating our findings, and receive feedback about what professionals want from research.
3. We will set up a network of researchers and practitioners to include researchers, teachers, educators and speech and language therapists. It is expected that this network will complement an already existing network created and maintained by Prof Courtenay Norbury (LiLaC: Literacy, Language and Communication, http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/sites/lilac/new_site/?page_id=12). As Prof Norbury is moving to UCL this provides an excellent opportunity for joining forces and extend the network to cover early years in addition to primary school years. The aim will be for the network to provide a long-term forum for researcher-practitioner interactions and collaborative efforts in developing research with impact. This pathway will contribute to dissemination but crucially will further provide opportunities for practitioners to influence and collaborate in the design of research. 

This research is very timely given: (a) the extension of childcare vouchers to some eligible 2 year-olds in England (https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds). (b) renewed emphasis on language communication skills in the recently introduced statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/335504/EYFS_framework_from_1_September_2014__with_clarification_note.pdf), which has children's communication and language as one of three prime areas that early years educators need to focus on.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>531923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>11A70E41-1D09-4D12-A785-811A78C9D3FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping language to the world: the role of iconicity in the sign language input.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f0ce699f39d569a06a246999fb9660e2"><gtr:id>f0ce699f39d569a06a246999fb9660e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Perniss P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1363-755X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9fdce5d96e80.41536701</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P00024X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24C2FD61-D899-497D-8F52-D8C590EAD745</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Child Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4685997F-6C82-4108-9425-1593E206E9F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Acquisition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7B8CEF0E-4DA8-4D0E-812A-5B92663E5EB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psycholinguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
