On the standard view each sentence in a conversation conveys a chunk of information. As a conversation proceeds the total amount of information adds up.

There is an alternative to this view. On this alternative, generally called the dynamic view, sentences are instead treated as instructions to update one's assumptions. Thus, sentences do not simply encode facts but rather urge the conversational participants to change their assumptions. Moreover the meaning of individual sentences depends essentially on what they are doing to the body of information that has been built up by previous sentences.

How could we ever tell apart these views? On one view, the sentence 'it's raining' encodes simply the fact that it's raining, on the other view, the sentence is a kind of instruction to believe in rain. In this simple case the two views might simply reflect different theoretical perspectives without any substantive disagreement about how language works.

This project is aimed however at showing that there are real differences between these views. It turns out that certain aspects of language use such as the use of pronouns and the use of words like 'might' can be modeled in irreconcilable ways within these two perspectives. A case can be made that the standard view of language according to which sentences simply encode information cannot properly account for our use of these terms. 

 To take an example it is hard on the standard view to characterize the information encoded by the sequence of sentences, 'A woman walked in.', 'She ordered a latte.' It is hard to see how we can characterize the contribution of the second sentence in a way that is independent of the first. For it is not clear what fact is encoded by the second sentence if a particular woman has not been picked out by the first. On the dynamic perspective, by contrast, nothing is mysterious about these sentences: we can view the first sentence as introducing a discourse referent and the second as adding some information about that referent. Likewise, on the dynamic perspective modals terms such as 'might' do not express facts but rather serve as tests of sorts of the current information available to conversational participants. When I say 'It might be raining', I am not putting forward a proposition but trying to ensure our information state at that point in the conversation is compatible with the information that it is raining.

To reject the standard view, however, a case needs to be made that the dynamic perspective allows a systematic and coherent departure from the standard view and that it better fits the facts. So far this has not been done. For one thing, the fundamental assumptions of the standard view are rarely described in rigorous detail to make them testable. In addition, the arguments that the standard view is inadequate have not been given a sufficiently systematic examination.

This project aims to fill these gaps. I will give a precise but general statement of the assumptions embedded in the standard view. I will do this by characterizing the standard view in terms of its basic formal structure: in this way I will give mathematically precise conditions applicable across different frameworks in philosophy and linguistics.

The second part of the project is to look at language use and assess whether it conforms better to the standard view or its dynamic alternatives. Here, I will use a variety of methods: sometimes careful analysis of how terms like quantifiers and pronouns behave in English and other languages, but also sometimes psychological experiments to probe more deeply into the details of how we use language.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Understanding spoken and written text is at the center of the digital economy. For instance, Google uses statistical tools of stunning power to provide the most relevant websites in response to web searches phrased in natural language. Increasingly, search engines (and tools like Apple's Siri) provide not just links to websites but direct answers to questions, engaging in human/machine dialogue. To date the understanding of language that these tools deploy is not very sophisticated from a linguistic point of view: their success in providing correct answers depends more on statistical power than on their understanding such subtleties of communication as how pronouns function and how words like the 'might' work. However, as such technology advance the need for a mathematically precise, but also empirically-based theories of how language encodes meaning will increase. Part of the goal in providing frameworks for thinking about how a text builds up information through successive assertions is to provide tools that those actually dealing with large tracts of natural language in the information economy might employ.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
