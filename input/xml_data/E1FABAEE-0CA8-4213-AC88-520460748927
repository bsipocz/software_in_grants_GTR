Many natural phenomena have a discrete nature or can be modelled in terms of difference equations. Any simulation of a continuous phenomena on a digital computers requires an appropriate discretisation. Difference equations have a wide range of practical applications from Fundamental Physics to Engineering. 

The theory of difference equations is considerably less developed than the classical theory of differential equations. Broadly speaking our research project aims to reduce the gap between them and to explore new features that are not available in the case of differential equations. A reformulation of the theory of difference equations in terms of difference algebra will enable us to use a variety of new methods and provide a rigorous framework. From the other side, non-trivial examples originated from the applied theory of difference equations could serve as a basis for further development and new concepts in difference algebra. 

It is difficult to overestimate the importance of continuous symmetries and local conservation laws in the theory and applications of differential equations. Often they carry the most valuable information about the model and are more important than exact solutions. In the project we will find a sequence of necessary conditions for the existence of a
high order symmetry (or a conservation law) for a given system of difference equations. Continuous symmetries and conservation laws can serve as a characteristic property for the class of integrable systems. Symmetries of
integrable partial differential equations can be generated by recursion (or Lenard) operators. We propose to develop an interesting and rather non-trivial extended analogue of Lenard's scheme.

Together with solutions of clearly set problems our project is poised to invade an uncharted territory of difference equations with approximate symmetries. To study properties and algebraic structures associated with approximately integrable equations will be a new and challenging direction of research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>105173</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Masterclass for GCSE students</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F37BB4FE-7ABA-4839-A0AA-8F74F9A49441</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop sparked the interests in Mathematics.

The PIs organised two-day workshop ``Algebraic Methods in Theory of Differential and Difference Equations'' on 6-7 December 2013 in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and 
Actuarial Science at the University of Kent (partially funded by the LMS). The list of attendees included established mathematicians, early career researchers and PhD students from various UK institutions (Essex, Glasgow, Kent, Leeds, Loughborough, Northumbria, Plymouth, Surrey, UCL) and from abroad (Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, USA), with the total number of
attendees being 43.

The workshop brought together mathematical researchers
working in two different, but closely related, fields: differential and difference algebra on the one hand and differential and difference equations on the other, and to further promote dialogue between them. In particular, the workshop programme was comprised of 17 talks, of which six were given by overseas speakers and four 20-minute talks were presented by female PhD students.
The abstracts of all 17 talks are available to download from the website (http://www.kent.ac.uk /smsas/events/algebraic-methods.html). This workshop with a specific focus attracted more participants than we expected. It offered the attendees some viewpoints that were different from but clearly related to their own research. 

A short two days workshop ``Algebraic Interfaces of 
Integrability'' was held on 15-16 of May, 2015 at Leeds (partially supported by the LMS). Both PIs presented the results obtained from this research project. A complete 
list of talks with abstracts can be found at 
http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/cnls/research/integrable/cqi/2015/sol15.html


The basic framework and methods developed in this project formed a core material for postgraduate-level lecture courses at the EPSRC funded Taught Course Centres (London and MAGIC TCC). The 10-hour advanced LTCC course on
``Symmetries, Conservation Laws and the Variational Complex'' was given by J.P. Wang and 20-hour MAGIC
 course on ``Integrable Systems'' was given by A.V. Mikhailov in the spring term of 2014 and 2016.

The research team has published 13 original papers in leading international scientific journals, such as Letters in Mathematical Physics, nonlinearity, Physica D, Journal of Mathematical Physics, Studies in Applied Mathematics, Theoretical and Mathematical Physics and Journal of Physics A, and has submitted 4 more articles. All papers are distributed using electronic preprint archives available on the Internet: http://arxiv.org/. The research finding were presented not only at international colloquia, workshops and conferences but also delivered on the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (outside of the integrable systems community).

Recent promising developments in the optic communications based on spectral transform and fast algorithms for solution of differential-difference systems, which already enables to increase the capacity 
of the fibre optic communication systems by 15%
and beyond (UK EPSRC Programme Grant
UNLOC EP/J017582/1, ERC project ULTRALASER). The differential-difference systems and finite difference systems which we study in our project have immediate applications to engineering and technological problems which have 
considerable impact to the price and quality of telecommunication.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD39FCBC-792C-4070-A041-A9E3A092D865</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddf8edab4202.40986328</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This join EPSRC project EP/I038675/1 (funding a research associate for three years hosted in the Applied Mathematics Department, University of Leeds) and EP/I038659/1 (funding a PhD student hosted in the University of Kent).

The achievements from this award can be demonstrated in the following aspects:

1. Working on the project the research team has produced 17 papers in which 13 are already published in high rank journals and 4 are submitted (all papers are available on arxive). Recently a PhD student (in Kent) has successfully defended his thesis which is based on the part of the project findings.

2. Together with S-Sh.Gao and C.M.Yuan we have made a considerable progress in the reformulation of the theory of integrable differential-difference and finite difference equations in terms of differential and difference algebra. This is a solid basis for future rigorous theory of integrable difference equations.

3. We found explicit necessary conditions for integrability of finite difference equations. First order conditions are suitable for study quadrilateral equations which include all equations from the Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. We explored the second order integrability conditions for difference equations and derived a new integrable system together with its symmetries, conservation laws and related differential-difference systems.

4. Working on the extension of the Lenard scheme we have developed a new approach called the ``O'' scheme, based on the indecomposable sl(2,C)-modules in the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category O, to construct master symmetries and further to generate infinite hierarchies of symmetries, conservation laws for integrable equations. The discovered correspondence between elements of the module and symmetry structures is a new promising direction of research.

5. We studied the link between curvature flows for polygon evolutions and integrable discrete equations and maps 
using newly developed discrete moving frame method.

6. We have undertaken a systematic study of differential-difference and finite difference equations associated with finite reduction groups. We systemically investigated the elementary Darboux transformations of Lax representations
with finite reduction groups to study the connections among partial differential, differential-difference and finite difference systems as well as with integrable Yang-Baxter maps. Our construction can be naturally generalised to a non-commutative setting, such as Grassmann algebra valued differential difference and finite difference equations and Yang-Baxter maps. 

7. Together with V. Sokolov we lifted the Drinfeld-Sokolov relation of integrable systems with Kac-Moody algebras to the level of differential-difference equations and Yang-Baxter maps.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Differential-difference and finite-difference system emerging form the Darboux transformations of Lax operators can be regarded as integrable discretisations of the corresponding partial differential equations. These discretisations can be used for fast processing of optical signals in fibre optic communication (UK EPSRC Programme Grant UNLOC EP/J017582/1, ERC project ULTRALASER) and other numerical applications. 

The basic framework and methods developed in this project have formed and will be continued to be a core material for postgraduate-level lecture courses at the EPSRC funded Taught Course Centres (London and MAGIC TCC). 

Each of five publications have been cited over 10 times according to Google scholar. The research findings will be used and taken forward by researchers in both applied and pure mathematics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2E380B92-7C26-4985-9BBB-D13D19015F8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8dab6962268.89343740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://arxiv.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>LTCC</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E103EE6F-032B-44A4-BBE2-BE42203C43B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10 hour LTCC (the London Taught Course Centre) advanced course for PhD students on Symmetries, Conservation Laws and the Variational Complex were developed and delivered in 2015.
