Neurological disorders have a profound effect in the lives of many people that are either directly or indirectly affected by them. It is of particular interest that a variety of neurological disorders that affect for instance memory, cognition or learning abilities are now believed to have a neurodevelopmental component in their origin. Consequently, the more we understand what the molecules are that work together and maintain the proper functioning of the brain, the more we will be able to understand what goes wrong in neurological disorders. A detailed knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the different functions of the brain will in turn provide us with valuable tools and targets that can be subsequently used to improve the therapeutical methods used to treat these disorders. Unfortunately though, the cerebral cortex is a tissue that is only present in mammals. Thus, if we want to understand the molecular mechanisms that operate in the brain in order to multiply our tools in treating efficiently a wider range of patients we need to use a mammalian system to perform this research. Thus, the main objective of this project is the use of rodents to unravel the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of memory in mammals. Our efforts will focus in the intracellular components of this process. We have already isolated a gene whose function appears to regulate the reaction of neurons that regulate learning ability. What is interesting is that this gene can be used as a reference point and direct our research in identifying additional components that regulate learning abilities. Thus, our major aim is to analyse into detail this mechanism in an effort to understand how our brain 'learns'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our research proposal focuses on the study of a signal transduction pathway, in which Slap-1 plays a central role, that is implicated in regulation of learning and memory in rodents. Slap-1 is preferentially expressed by deep layer cortical neurons and in the hippocampus. Slap-1 was initially identified in a yeast two hybrid screen that used the intracellular domain of EphA2 as bait. Subsequently, the function of slap-1 has been described so far only in the immune system where it is involved in the T Cell Receptor (TCR) signalling pathway. Numerous data relate Eph to axon pathfinding long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning. To investigate whether slap-1 is downstream of Eph signalling, the phenotype and behaviour of the slap-1 -/- animals has been analysed. Our preliminary results show that the mutant animals are faster in learning in established behavioural tasks. Thus it appears that slap-1 is part of a signalling mechanism that is central to the molecular basis of learning and memory. The objective of this proposal is to characterise the components of this signalling mechanism. Using standard histological methods we will analyse the possible role in the brain of the genes that interact with Slap-1 in TCR signalling. Although these molecules interact with Slap-1 in the immune system it does not necessarily mean that they will operate together in the brain as well. To isolate the molecules that indeed interact with Slap-1 a yeast two-hybrid screen will be performed using Slap-1 as bait. By means of a proteomic screen we will compare the differences in the phosphorylation pattern of the WT and mutant animals in an attempt to identify downstream targets that are affected in the mutant animals. Finally using dissociated neuronal cultures and hippocampal brain slices we will assay the functional significance and interaction of the isolated molecules in synapse formation and LTP.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>322008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E000754/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
