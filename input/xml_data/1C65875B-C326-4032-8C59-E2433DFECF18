This collaboration would hugely advance the burgeoning Raman activity at Sheffield and in doing so improve the knowledge base for the UK in this key area of structural determination. The group of the PI at Sheffield have recently discovered a new AFE, PbZrO3-structured ceramic based on Nd-doped BiFeO3 (BNF). In collaboration with the University of Leeds, the development of thin films of Nd-doped BiFeO3 (BNF) using pulsed laser deposition will shortly begin. The initial aims of this new programme will be to establish whether the AFE structure is retained within the film and whether the structural phase transitions observed in bulk as a function of temperature and composition remain valid. We have established that Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the structural changes within BNF system but the main problem with such new materials is in the detailed interpretation of the spectra. The key research goals of the Visiting Fellowship are therefore to i) establish the experimental protocols to obtain high quality UV Raman spectra from thin functional films and ii) utilise the vast experience of Dr Hlinka to help interpret the spectra. In addition to the Raman study, the group of the PI will obtain detailed structural information using analytical electron microscopy (EP/F006098/1, S.Miao). In this manner, a complete understanding of the structural changes in BNF thin films will be obtained which will be utilised to interpret the ferroelectric and dielectric behaviour. In addition to these scientific goals, Dr Hlinka will give tutorials on the 'Use of Vibrational Spectroscopy in the Study of Functional Oxides' and will visit several interested groups within the UK Functional Oxide community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major impact of this programme is to establish strong funded links between the Academy of Science and the CCL in order to improve our understanding of vibrational spectroscopy and thereby of the structure and symmetry of functional oxides over a range of length scales. This will positively influence many projects within the CCL and enhance our ability to develop and improve functional oxides with the goal of future exploitation. In addition to research, Dr Hlinka will undertake to visit UK groups interested in the study of functional oxides. He will impart his knowledge to these groups and establish new collaborations to pursue on his return to the Czech Republic. He will also give a sequence of tutorials to Ph.D. students at Engineering Materials in the use and interpretation of vibrational spectroscopy to study functional oxides. The schedule of the tutorials will be made known to interested groups who will be encouraged to participate by sending students. The benefit to the UK community of such visits and tutorials is adequately demonstrated in the very positive comments regarding this aspect of the proposal in the letters of support. The purpose of the programme is to establish the necessary protocols to obtain and interpret Raman spectra from BNF ceramics and films. Any commercial product fabricated using BNF is many years away and much groundwork is required. However, the programme will further the efforts at Sheffield to develop BNF and add valuable understanding to drive development of this exciting PbO-free material. Potential devices based on AFE/FE switching are envisaged and efforts are underway to fabricate solid solutions with optimised properties. Should the research culminate in a commercially viable functional thin film material then the potential for exploitation is huge and field changing. In this event, appropriate IPR will be sought but it is not anticipated that patentable technology will emerge directly from this programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>579ADFDF-8018-4008-9B08-525F9FFF25C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research formed part of several invited presentations and seminars over a number of years at conferences such as Electronic Materials and there Applications, Electroceramics and International Symposium on Applied Ferroelectrics as well as seminars at Glasgow and Liverpool University</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7fbf9409dd4.77793188</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The grant in part facilitated the establishment of the Raman as a part of a 'Small Research Facility' at Sheffield so that now has its own income stream and can be maintained to a high level. The machine thus can be used on a wide range of projects across the University.

Raman can now be used routinely on a wide range of projects and the instrument can be maintained at the highest level.

Beneficiaries: University of Sheffield

Contribution Method: Knowledge and expertise was transferred to a Senior Experimental Officer who now runs the Raman within the 'Small Research Facility

The work has resulted in a new methodology by which to assign Raman active modes in oxide systems without the requirement of a single crystal. In BiFeO3, that the mode frequencies change as the incident angle of the light changes with respect to the ferroelectric axis. In a ceramic, a statistical distribution of frequencies with respect to the ferroelectric axis is used to assign accurately the vibrational modes. This can be applied to a broad class of solids which have a unique polar axis.

New methodology of looking at the vibrational modes in solids using Raman Spectroscopy.

Beneficiaries: Vibrational Spectroscopy community

Contribution Method: The published work was the first demonstration of the methodology which can be applied to a large number of important functional materials for which single crystal fabrication is difficult but which readily form ceramics</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>975970F2-7F68-4DB4-96D3-30E7B1F77FBD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-5189712210.735038de259fce</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Raman active vibrational spectra in BiFeO3 were analysed and a new methodology derived to assign modes based on a statistical distribution with respect to the oblique (ferroelectric) axis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Fundamental Research which may help in the future improve functional properties of materials.
