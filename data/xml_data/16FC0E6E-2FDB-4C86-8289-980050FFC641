Project)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J013625/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The CAER (Caerau and Ely Rediscovering) Heritage Project will be a multi-disciplinary, multi-period community project exploring the history and archaeology of settlement, land use, and society in Caerau and Ely (a deprived suburb of Cardiff) and relating this to the wider Cardiff and South Wales region. Set within the local housing estates is the large and unexplored Caerau Iron Age hill fort, inside of which was constructed a medieval ringwork and medieval church. The exploration of this multi-period site represents a highly engaging focal point for the project which it is hoped will also encompass aspects of Ely's history from prehistory through to the 21st century - constructing a broad narrative of the history and archaeology of the Cardiff region through the story of this one significant location. The project will seek to connect the past to the present, making the heritage of the district relevant and important for contemporary communities - creating a heightened sense of place and developing educational opportunities and improving social cohesion and inter-generational contact. 

This project will build on significant engagement work which has already been completed by School of History, Archaeology and Religion with community groups and schools in the Caerau/Ely district of Cardiff and in collaboration with a range of heritage institutions in South East Wales. These include an extensive series of partnership-building meetings held with a significant range of stakeholders including CADW, the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and the National Museum of Wales together with significant community partners including Communities First, Glyn Derw High School and the Caerau Local History Project. 

Within the contemporary social context, the communities of Caerau and Ely face significant educational barriers at a variety of levels and ages due to a range of social problems. There is also a significant and, to a large extent, exaggerated stigma associated with this area of Cardiff and its problems. Working with local schools and community groups the project aims to address a range of problems in relation to the management, presentation and history of the area and, particularly, the Caerau Iron Age fort, which has never been explored through archaeological or antiquarian research. This constitutes a little known yet extremely valuable and attractive local resource for educational opportunities and for creating a more positive perception of the area and its communities. 

A series of heritage based educational activities will take place both on Caerau Hill and the Caerau and Ely locality throughout the oncoming year to explore the area's long and fascinating past. This will be instigated by a week of archaeological activities in March 2012 designed to engage local community youth and school groups as a pilot project. This will gauge local interest for a longer term, sustainable community heritage project or projects. A geophysical survey is proposed during this week along with other archaeological, art and learning activities. All these activities will be tailored to the delivery of basic skills training together with a development of awareness and knowledge about the site. From the outset, the local schools and communities will be involved and invested in answering important research questions about this hugely significant, but under-researched, hill fort.

We envisage that this will be just the initial phase of a sustainable CAER Heritage project; constituting of a series of pilot activities which will act not only as a stimulus for a sustainable longstanding heritage project in Caerau/Ely but also as a testimonial showcase for SHARE/Cardiff University to build similar heritage partnerships/outreach activities with other communities in South East Wales region and more broadly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?
The key beneficiaries outside the academic community will be the communities of Caerau/Ely, other communities in deprived areas of Cardiff (via open days/outreach contacts) and much more broadly communities, locally and nationally, via media coverage, museum displays and a web resource. 
Key groups include:
Local school children
Under-represented groups such as the elderly, BME groups, single mothers
Community workers/teachers
Scout and guide groups
Young people, youth groups

How might they benefit from this research?
Networks within the local communities will benefit from an enriched understanding of the past and the creation a heightened sense of place and local identity. In particular, local people will be connected to their heritage through informal/formal educational activities, interpretation events and participant led initiatives. This will help reduce anti-social and negative behaviour on Caerau hill and improve the presentation of the hill fort and surrounding area creating a valuable local and national resource for leisure and learning activities.

By undertaking multi-period, multi-disciplinary studies, the project aims to engage with a wide range of people from the local communities, and to challenge or change internal and external attitudes towards Caerau and Ely and its communities. Particular benefits will include:

Opportunities for training and development of key skills through an engaging subject specific heritage exploration for local children, young people and adults thereby challenging aspirational poverty and breaking down barriers to education.

To create lasting links between Caerau and Ely communities, particularly schools and community organisations (e.g. Communities First), with Cardiff University in collaboration with other institutions such as National Museum Wales and CADW.

To undertake programs of activities with a range of age-groups from different schools to encourage cross-age-group learning, particularly in the transition phase from primary to secondary

A range of focused activities, such as vegetation clearance and ecological artwork, to engage with disadvantaged and under-represented youngsters who are on the fringes of the school system

Opportunities for all members of the local community (young, old, ethnic minorities, scout and guide groups) to work together on specific focused heritage events and develop their own sustainable projects

To widen access and break down barriers to higher education by arranging visits of local school children to Cardiff University and National Museum Wales, St. Fagans and to bring expertise from those organisations into the Caerau and Ely communities</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19934</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Model Village project transformed participants into both historical and archaeological co-researchers and also into co-producers and co-directors of a remarkable animated film that explores the value of community heritage assets through a temporal perspective of past, present and future.

The involvement of two young people facing exclusion from the CAER Young People Opportunity project has subsequently resulted in one of those young people (Jake) securing a work placement at the Glamorgan Archive. Overall, the co-production strategies and research developed by the Model Village Project have significantly informed a much larger grant application The Hidden Hillfort Project which was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund by the CAER team in September 2016 (&amp;pound; 986,200.00).

These activities included artefact analysis and Iron-Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron-Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark.</gtr:description><gtr:id>77628D53-09BD-4659-8DB2-9AA470AB3C5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tribal Logos proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school (this is a location which experiences vandalism and anti-sicial behaviour). The Tribal Logo activities culminated with a project open day for local families at the Caerau site with further participation in surveying and other interactive activities by local adult residents. 150 local residents attended this event, and many came with their families and stayed for most of the day - a positive response to our strategy of attempting to engage and build trust with the wider community through the local secondary schools and heritage themed artwork in partnership with a professional artist.

15 pupils from Y8 - Y10 of Woodland High School and 15 pupils from Y8 from neighbouring Glyn Derw High School/Michaelston Community College (once two separate schools but recently federated) worked with professional artist Paul Evans and Cardiff University CAER Heritage Project to co-produce designs for a series of Iron Age 'playable artworks': themed sports equipment including 'Ping Pong Portals to the Past' or 'Iron Age Street Art' outdoor table tennis tables, decorated table tennis balls, and football kit. After the conclusion of the project the table tennis tables have been permanently sited outside The Michaelston Community College learning centre Ely and Woodlands High school.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C268D00B-99AE-462C-8C84-44E3701E208D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Romanobritish' brought together two local schools, thus strengthening community bonds, challenging stereotypes, improving life choices, developing confidence, partnerships and social networks. The project and its output were also a unique, creative means of bringing the inspiration for this project - the Iron Age heritage of Caerau and Ely to life and, quite literally, into play. Caerau and Ely are host to an extraordinary physical heritage: one of the largest hill forts in South Wales and a Roman villa buried beneath the school playing fields - two sites that local school children have had hands on roles in investigating through the CAER Heritage Project. What made this project so distinctive is not only this amazing heritage, but also its foundation on mutually supportive creative play. This fed directly into 'playable' artworks: doorways to engagement with heritage, and stimuli for future curiosity/discussion way beyond the timescale of the project.
The project offered participating young people a structured framework of creative workshops and university quality accessible visual/historical references and acted as a pilot project based around collaborative participation from a special needs and mainstream school. A series of intensive creative workshops with a professional artist and an academic were delivered in these community schools. Qualitative outecomes included valuing artistic ability of young people with learning disabilities within the creative process, inculcating pride in place, development of grass roots relationships, aiding transition at a time of upheaval for Glyn Derw High pupils (the school was at that time being merged and effectively closed down). Challenging stigmas between mainstream and special needs secondary education, expanding social networks and providing new life opportunities by working with creative and academic professionals, raising aspirations and breaking down barriers to higher education, valuing community assets - in particular local heritage.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh). The A4 sized mural design was then scaled to full size - over 15 metres in length - and painstakingly applied onto the underpass and in masonry paint. The young people from the youth centre participated in the painting and added their own graffiti 'tags'. The resulting artwork constituted a vivid, direct, contemporary connection to the pre-historic past which has since been incorporated into the HEART of Cardiff Heritahe Trails network.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DACB79C3-28B5-49DD-8C62-8EB7C2B2CB9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CAER team, including artist Paul Evans and Ian Daniel (Celtic demonstrator from the National Museum of Wales), worked with 3 Youth Workers to develop and devise a programme of heritage themed trips and create an art installation with a small group of young people facing exclusion.

Through the exhibition, Cardiff residents and visitors to the city experience the positive, vibrant history of Ely and Caerau, thus tackling ill-founded stereotypes and the external stigmas about the area. 
This project worked with elderly residents, valuing their knowledge and expertise, developing social networks, addressing isolation and nurturing intergenerational contact with young people. 30 year 9 school pupils gained opportunities for educational development and new skills including communication, team building, numeracy and literacy. 20 people were interviewed by the children for the exhibition and mural. 
As the school involved has a low take-up to University, breaking down barriers to HE was a significant objective, with pupils working alongside academics and postgraduates. One sixth-former who participated is now considering studying history at university. 
A further 60 people contributed to the project, by sharing memories at a range of local events in collaboration with community development partner ACE (Action in Caerau and Ely). Participants got a greater understanding not only of their WW1 heritage, but of the houses and streets in which they live. 
The project reinforced the University's commitment to the co-production of knowledge with local communities. It facilitated strong partnerships with local community groups and non-HE partners. Follow on projects are now planned to explore local place names and the project has also informed aspects of a recently secured large Heritage Lottery Grant to explore the area's rich archaeology and heritage. 
One of the schoolchildren involved said: &amp;quot; it was interesting to see what happened and what Ely was like back thenit was a fun experience, especially at the Glamorgan Archives and interviewing people who have lived in Ely for many yearsI loved hearing older people's stories about what they experienced in the past and seeing how different it was to my own life in Ely now.&amp;quot;
One of the hardest to reach pupils - who was at risk of exclusion from school - said in his feedback that the project had helped him understand how important school is, helped his learning in school, helped improve his confidence and social skills and that he learnt new skills on the trip. After a visit to the Glamorgan Archives, in his words, he said 'It was sick. I want to go here again.' He has since undertaken work experience at the Archives. 
The project has been submitted for consideration to the Guardian Higher Education Awards - Social and Community Impact category'

These activities included artefact analysis and Iron-Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron-Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.

The week of school activities culminated with a project open day for local families at the Caerau site with further participation in surveying and other interactive activities by local adult residents. 150 local residents attended this event, and many came with their families and stayed for most of the day - a positive response to our strategy of attempting to engage and build trust with the wider community through the local secondary schools.

Participation in Timeteam &amp;amp; community excavations.
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. 
Benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013).

Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context. 

Year 7 and 9 pupils from Fitzalan returned to the Caerau site in the summers of 2013 and 2014 and were actively involved in the community archaeological excavations.

30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.
Poverty Detectives Project (March 2012)

Pathway to the Past Mural, March 2013 (see CAER blog entries March 2013)
Pathway to the Past was a CAER spin-off project funded by an All Our Stories HLF grant in collaboration with our community partners Action Caerau &amp;amp; Ely (ACE) - working with staff from the National History Museum, North Ely Youth and Community Centre and 10 local young people (aged between 14-16) experiencing exclusion from school. Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail.

Celtic Village Excavation 
Digging Caerau 2013 started with a training excavation for local people at St Fagans National History Museum in May 2013. Recent redevelopment of the museum meant that the museum's 'Celtic Village' (made up of 3 reconstructed Iron Age roundhouses) was demolished. This provided an opportunity for local people to learn basic excavation skills on a 'replica' Iron Age site before encountering the real thing as part of an accredited adult learner's course.

Photos and Iolo Exhibition, July 2014 (as part of Connected Communities Festival)
Photos and Iolo was a CAER Heritage Project exhibition format that was developed and co-produced by artist Paul Evans with pupils from Glyn Derw High School, National Museum Wales staff Loveday Williams, Owain Rhys and Ian Daniel, and CAER Heritage Project directors Dave Wyatt and Oliver Davis. Consisting of a series of re-usable pop-up banners Photos and Iolo was an interactive experience that encouraged viewers to get involved with the images on display by searching for the bard Iolo (or Ian Daniel, the Museum's Celtic demonstrator) - photo-shopped into images of Caerau and Ely that were taken by local residents. Once the participants have found Iolo then they are encouraged to take part in a riddle competition. These Riddles were created by pupils from Glyn Derw High School. The images featured came from a Barnardos project which took place in Ely and Caerau in the 1980s.

In March 2012, 90 pupils and 5 teachers from 3 participating secondary schools, Glyn Derw, Fitzalan and Mary Immaculate High were involved in a range of activities at the Caerau hillfort designed to interest and invest them in the site and conduct research. These activities included artefact analysis and Iron Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.
School participation in Timeteam excavation and Programme (April, 2012).
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. The overall benefits of this media intervention, generally, outweighed any short-term negative impacts. Indeed, these benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013). Timeteam episode viewing figures frequently exceed 1.5m in the UK alone and the programme is also broadcast in a number of other countries, giving wide exposure to both the communities and this little known archaeological site. 
CAER Project Exhibition (June 2012-February 2013)
Following on from their involvement in geophysical survey, the creation of tribal logo artwork and Timeteam excavations 90 pupils from 3 participating secondary schools, produced displays of artwork, models, creative writing and historical perspectives on the Iron Age. Their coursework made up an exhibition which was displayed at St Fagans National History Museum in June 2012. The exhibition was opened by Mark Drakeford, Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and Sian Price, series director of Timeteam. 
In January and February 2013 we took this exhibition on tour - first we were invited to the Welsh Government's Senedd building in Cardiff Bay by Mark Drakeford and then travelled onto the Cardiff Story Museum in central Cardiff later in February 2013. The then heritage minister, Huw Lewis, opened the exhibition at Cardiff Story and also launched Digging Caerau, with the exhibition remaining on display at the museum for 4 weeks. Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context. 
CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.
Poverty Detectives Project (March 2013)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history project which explored child poverty past and present with a focus on the lives of 19th century children in the Cardiff area. The pupils worked with academic historians, archivists at the Glamorgan Archives and CAER project artist Paul Evans to creatively express their findings through the creation of time-travelling conversations enacted by puppets created by the pupils. This project produced some inspiring outputs and was also embedded in the literacy and numeracy curriculum.
Digging Caerau Excavations (June-July 2013 and 2014) 
Glyn Derw High pupils and teachers were directly involved with the excavations with several classes undertaking archaeological fieldwork activities. More than 80 pupils, varying in age-group from Year 7 to Year 13 visited the site, over the two excavations, and worked in small groups with professional staff as supervisors. They were actively involved with various different on-site activities from excavation, sieving and finds processing, to more creative activities such as making Iron Age pots.
School co-production of way marks logos (December 2014 to March 2014)
In December 2013 Dave Wyatt and Paul Evans visited Michaelston College and Glyn Derw to brainstorm, design and develop the first two way-mark designs for the HEART of Cardiff trails. These intensive creative workshops focussed on 'Medieval Michaelston' and the 'Romans to the Races' trails. After a brief introduction, the young people made a series of quick thumbnail sketches. The young people then selected their favourite sketch and were given guidance on how to convert this design into a simple motif, suitable for stencilling.
Two follow on workshops were delivered to the same classes in each school in March 2014. The challenge behind the workshops was to create transitory, witty works of art that reflected something of the heritage of the trail - creating ephemeral artworks and in situ images to populate our heritage trail resources. At Glyn Derw High we researched Roman motifs and made a series of thumb-nail sketches. We then visited the heritage trail in Trelai fields to create an army of buried legionaries emerging from the site of the Roman Villa on the Romans to Races trail. The young artists then made 3D graffiti models and placed these along the trail photographing them as they went. 
A similar workshop was also undertaken with the pupils at Michaelston Community College, this time themed on the medieval heritage of the location including St Michael's church. We decided that the door of the church would make an excellent 'portal' into the past - so we made one using interwoven twigs and branches. As at Glyn Derw, during the next stage of the workshop the young people made individual ephemeral artworks using modelling clay - again from the preliminary sketches based on Medieval motifs. The, tried and tested, combination of archaeological and historically themed art and direct physical engagement with local sites proved an effective means of investing and engaging a new group of young people in their local heritage whilst inculcating a range of creative and interpersonal skills.
Way marking the Trails (April 2014)
With the way mark logos complete the designs have been employed to create a series of plastic stencils that have been laser cut with the assistance of teachers at Michaelston Community College. Over April 2014 the community groups and school pupils involved in creating the way mark logos have walked each of their respective trails employing the stencils to make impermanent (chalk, scrubbing surfaces, grass cutting) and permanent marks (spray paint) at key points on the trails to mark the way. 
These way marks interface with a published trail leaflet and online HEART of Cardiff trail web resource for the trails which features artwork and other contributions of memories and knowledge from participating schools and community members. To ensure ongoing 'ownership' and engagement of co-creators and their trails both ACE and participating schools have agreed to organise bi-annual trail walks to litter pick, monitor access, vegetation clearance and to refresh the impermanent and permanent markers with the way mark logo stencils.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5433e9150e3409.56435796-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Both school management and staff have been engaged and involved in all stages of the project including funding bid consultation.

Tribal Logo, Geophysical Survey and Archaeological Activities (March 2012)
In March 2012, 90 pupils and 5 teachers from 3 participating secondary schools, Glyn Derw, Fitzalan and Mary Immaculate High were involved in a range of activities at the Caerau hillfort designed to interest and invest them in the site and conduct research. These activities included artefact analysis and Iron-Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron-Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.

The week of school activities culminated with a project open day for local families at the Caerau site with further participation in surveying and other interactive activities by local adult residents. 150 local residents attended this event, and many came with their families and stayed for most of the day - a positive response to our strategy of attempting to engage and build trust with the wider community through the local secondary schools.

Community participation in Timeteam excavation and Programme (April, 2012).
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. 

Managing expectations on all sides was a difficult process for project co-ordinators. This said, the overall benefits of this media intervention, generally, outweighed any short-term negative impacts. Indeed, these benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013). Timeteam episode viewing figures frequently exceed 1.5m in the UK alone and the programme is also broadcast in a number of other countries, giving wide exposure to both the communities and this little known archaeological site. 

In terms of archaeological research, Timeteam spent three days working at the site producing a full geophysical survey of the interior of the hillfort and uncovering evidence of Iron Age houses and enclosures through excavation, as well as the remains of pots and quernstones used for grinding grain to make flour. The discoveries suggested a long occupation at Caerau dating from the Bronze Age (1000 BC) to Roman times (AD 200) and informed a subsequent and much larger and more inclusive 4 week community excavation under the separately funded AHRC Connected Communities Digging Caerau project.

CAER Project Exhibition (June 2012-February 2013)
Following on from their involvement in geophysical survey, the creation of tribal logo artwork and Timeteam excavations 90 pupils from 3 participating secondary schools, produced displays of artwork, models, creative writing and historical perspectives on the Iron Age. Their coursework made up an exhibition which was displayed at St Fagans National History Museum in June 2012. The exhibition was opened by Mark Drakeford, Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and Sian Price, series director of Timeteam. 

In January and February 2013 we took this exhibition on tour - first we were invited to the Welsh Government's Senedd building in Cardiff Bay by Mark Drakeford and then travelled onto the Cardiff Story Museum in central Cardiff later in February 2013. The then heritage minister, Huw Lewis, opened the exhibition at Cardiff Story and also launched Digging Caerau, with the exhibition remaining on display at the museum for 4 weeks. Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context. 

CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.

Travel Back to the Iron Age @Cardiff Story week of family activities (February, 2013)
In conjunction with the CAER exhibition at the Cardiff Story Museum, the CAER team, including 15 undergraduate volunteers, delivered a week of lunchtime family interactive activities during half-term February 2013 themed on the exhibition and the Iron Age in Cardiff. The museum estimates that 200 visiting parents and children from the Cardiff locality participated in these activities alone and highlighted that many of these visitors were first time visitors to the museum. This initiative also developed employability skills and provided networking opportunities for our undergraduate students. 

Poverty Detectives Project (March 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history project which explored child poverty past and present with a focus on the lives of 19th century children in the Cardiff area. The pupils worked with academic historians, archivists at the Glamorgan Archives and CAER project artist Paul Evans to creatively express their findings through the creation of time-travelling conversations enacted by puppets created by the pupils. This project produced some inspiring outputs and was also embedded in the literacy and numeracy curriculum.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>912471BB-A7B3-4F44-84CF-1C843E283089</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460dd8cc07300.46813504</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cardiff is Europe's youngest capital city and its history is dominated by its maritime and industrial heritage. But nestled deep in one of its suburbs, surrounded by houses, is one of the most important, yet little understood, prehistoric monuments in the region - Caerau Hillfort. Enclosing an area of more than 5 hectares, Caerau Hillfort, is by far the largest Iron-Age hillfort in south Glamorgan. In 2011, archaeologists and historians from the School of History, Archaeology and Religion (SHARE) at Cardiff University teamed up with local community organisation ACE (Action in Caerau and Ely), local residents and local schools to explore the West Cardiff past (including the hillfort) and put local people at the heart of cutting-edge co-produced archaeological and historical research. Caerau and Ely are home to more than 25,000 people yet despite strong community ties, the people that live there are now burdened by significant social and economic deprivation, particularly high unemployment. Moreover, a community disturbance in 1991 was publicized in the media as a 'riot' and led to a deluge of long lasting bad publicity for the area. CAER is not a straightforward community archaeology research project. It is underpinned by objectives forged at a series of initial meetings involving local residents, local schools representatives, the local community development agency, local heritage institutions and a small team of academics. Importantly, these objectives are not focussed upon archaeological or historical research but rather how such research might be employed to address negative views associated with these local communities and the broader challenges which they face. From its outset, the project sought to utilise rich and untapped heritage assets and local expertise to develop educational and life opportunities: building confidence, challenging negative stereotypes and realising the positive potential of the process of research co-production. This grant constituted phase 1 of the project in which partnerships and trust were built with the local communities. The project involved community participants (including school pupils, young people facing exclusion and the long term unemployed) in a variety of co-produced projects, including geophysical survey of the hillfort, exhibitions, art installations, local history projects and involvement in a Timeteam excavation featured in a major TV production.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From the outset the CAER Heritage Project's key objectives have been to use history and archaeology to develop educational opportunities and to challenge stigmas and marginalisation associated within the local communities. After all, the presence of a large multivallate hillfort in this area suggests that in prehistory Caerau and Ely were actually once the power centre in the Cardiff region. The project therefore aims to celebrate this remarkable past and to realise the potential of the significant yet underutilised heritage assets within these communities. The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners. To date the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). The co-production strategies employed by the project in relation to community and heritage assets have significant transferability and have been recently recognised in a national award bestowed by the NCCPE.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63FD506D-5AC4-447D-B511-014537D55C86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460d49ff2cb48.74418737</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://caerheritageprojectdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/caerbooklet_english.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team invited to contribute to advisory session re proposed NCCPE Research for All Journal.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>157694D6-413B-494D-98E7-033760880B2C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb4f1e475b6.89924938</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team deliver bespoke seminar on co-production strategies to RCUK staff at Polaris House (arranged by NCCPE)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7E4EB1E-CA33-422B-8B2F-FA192D1FEA2C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb422ac5c37.33799615</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER Project the subject of an AHRC Impact Case Study (Hyland/Lugg) and Film</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF01786D-4A01-4655-A0DC-13C07E4A9ED6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460ccc821d6a5.64718420</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Research-Councils-UK-(RCUK)-Impact-Report-2013.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Heritage Debate in Welsh Government: CAER Project highlighted as a good example of heritage regeneration in Welsh Government Senedd debate on 'ensuring wider access to our heritage and culture' (at 4:12.05) re link below.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20725822-F11F-4F87-8A30-54E928A1F7E8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb1a4ebba59.42815925</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.senedd.tv/archiveplayer.jsf?v=en_100000_21_01_2014&amp;t=13569&amp;l=en</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER co-production presentation delivered to the RCUK Public Engagement with Research Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>295B820C-BBDA-4E59-BBD1-135438FCBAD9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bc8ec9d47ba7.20978923</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NCCPE Award highlights CAER Project as an example of best practice re co-production</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDAE99A5-8722-4408-B6B5-441823EF6E07</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460cdaa3994a4.35699248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/blog/caer-heritage-project</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team meet with Director of Education LEA Cardiff to discuss plans for CAER to inform curriculum in West Cardiff secondary schools</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B110E697-E369-41B5-9B1F-B9689715AE65</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bcb4118740a2.84154735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners.

Co-production is a term becoming current in some European policy circles (Boyle and Harris 2009; Needham 2008) and in Wales, values of 'community' have long been the rallying cry of Welsh politicians (Rees 1997). Yet, too often, the concept of 'community' is approached by professionals and outsiders simplistically, lacking structures for on-going, systematic means of eliciting and hearing its 'differentiated solidarities' (Young 2002 in Amin 2005, 627). We did not approach the aspiration of co-production uncritically and are aware of the potential issues around power, politics and participation (Gallagher and Gallacher 2008; Holland et al. 2010; Bell 2013). 

A range of key strategies have therefore been employed within the Project to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Dr. Olly Davis) within our partner community organisation ACE; the embedding of activities in the local secondary school curriculum; the establishment of adult learners courses with a view to facilitating educational progression; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to engage young people facing exclusion; training excavations and community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The co-production strategies employed are based on well established principles yet the CAER team's approach to these principles and to co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research (e.g. NCCPE Award &amp;amp; seminar delivered to RCUK)</gtr:description><gtr:id>6B0B7706-C40E-4BE7-9516-B63971169136</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CAER team's approach to co-production and co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research for example the CAER Heritage Project was the overall winner of the NCCPE Engage competition and also won thier category of History and Heritage. The project was chosen from 230 quality entries across the UK, both Arts and Humanities and STEM projects. In the words of one of the judges the CAER project '...really did have it all'. Not only did the project make a profound impact on the community who got involved, it also profoundly changed the researchers, animating their work with new insights and expertise and reconnecting them to the educational mission that drives their work.' Winning this NCCPE award was a remarkable achievement given the number of entries received from across a range of discplines, moreover the CAER team were subsuquently invited to present on co-production strategies to RCUK staff in September 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545cb95c01cc40.01833187</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Co-production Strategies in Arts and Humanities</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E79FB831-2758-4AFB-9A1C-185439149754</gtr:id><gtr:title>The CAER Heritage Project: Revealing the Hidden History of Caerau and Ely</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24ec1c1c72c3631458d03e98a56b3eb1"><gtr:id>24ec1c1c72c3631458d03e98a56b3eb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O., Wyatt, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d00ecef388.41936420</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0949AF96-566C-49B3-AF9F-02DCDC2D8981</gtr:id><gtr:title>Excavations at the deserted medieval village of Michaelston-super-Ely, 2016: An interim report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9371e169858da81a448976bfd7571486"><gtr:id>9371e169858da81a448976bfd7571486</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O.P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58becf17351b22.12183300</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3AC30C6C-EE15-44E4-9098-4B0A7C6C0E54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Excavations at Caerau hillfort, Cardiff, South Wales, 2014: an interim report.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9371e169858da81a448976bfd7571486"><gtr:id>9371e169858da81a448976bfd7571486</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O.P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780956839848</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58bd63dd2c6191.09449660</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE63400D-1BFD-4C87-BDBB-4773DE341C1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geophysical Survey at Caerau Hillfort</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a3d92bc89ab3335a3e1d91a0002b2ce"><gtr:id>2a3d92bc89ab3335a3e1d91a0002b2ce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young, T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d3ecadf4d6.83732787</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B799371A-B1FD-459E-8ABB-5EAFC25D2800</gtr:id><gtr:title>The CAER Heritage Project: A note on a second season of fieldwork at Caerau Hillfort, Cardiff, 2014.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Archaeology in Wales</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0db42d2c87643284a7b2edfc05424826"><gtr:id>0db42d2c87643284a7b2edfc05424826</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O.P., Sharples, N. and Wyatt, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56bdb93d4ec153.01282280</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC341F99-429E-4889-873D-CCF4DED4F32C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cardiff's Celtic Hillfort: Digging Caerau</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/24ec1c1c72c3631458d03e98a56b3eb1"><gtr:id>24ec1c1c72c3631458d03e98a56b3eb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O., Wyatt, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5433d0fe1a05a3.14177688</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04C65659-AD97-4408-A837-209C3E3CD90D</gtr:id><gtr:title>'CAER Heritage Project: Legacy and Impact'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/073aa24b6491ff5660e8186f84253900"><gtr:id>073aa24b6491ff5660e8186f84253900</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davis, O. and Wyatt, D.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5463440f26a0c0.62959593</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>99ABEA8F-66D9-47E7-B7C2-A17251799ECF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Researching in Public: Contested Origins, Live Debates &amp;amp;
