This random archive materializes the Greek colonial class which effectively governed Egypt from Alexander the Great to the Arab conquest. About 10% of the papyri come from books, among them classical Greek authors whose work disappeared in whole or part during the Middle Ages: the songs of Sappho, the comedies of Menander, the elegies of Callimachus, all famous in their time. The remainder comprises public and private documents: edicts, tax-codes, tax-returns, census-forms, property-registers, sales, leases, loans, receipts, wills, marriages, shopping-lists, household accounts and many private letters, spanning mostly the first seven centuries AD, when Egypt was a province of the Roman and Byzantine Empires. \n\nThe sorting, decipherment and publication of this material, begun in 1898, still continues as a project that makes this unique resource available to scholars in various disciplines. Historians of classical literature get access to vanished libraries, which have recently yielded (for example) poems by Archilochus and Simonides; they can also study reading-habits and local litterateurs, the history of the book and of education. For the Roman historian, the documents come much closer to the ground than the literary sources, which focus on high politics. Official diaries record the day-to-day activity of officials. Court records show the cohabitation of Roman and local law. Land-leases and donkey-sales hint at levels of inflation. Private letters illustrate the grass-roots economy, the networks of family and friends, the Greek language assuming its modern form. Both books and documents chronicle Egyptian Christianity: persecution and establishment, heretical gospels and their elimination, personal devotion in prayers and amulets.\n\nIn the next phase of our project we aim to exploit unpublished papyri for their unique contribution to the cultural and political history of the Roman and early Byzantine world. We will publish early papyri of the New Testament and of unknown gospels, which exemplify the reading habits and doctrinal evolution of the primitive church: among them, a fragment of the novelistic 'Gospel of Andrew'. We have selected literary texts of works and authors long lost, such as Alcidamas' 'Praise of Poverty' or Menander's 'Harpist'; alongside these, anonymous bestsellers such as the novel 'Kalligone', in which the Greek colonists of the Crimea ally themselves with the Amazons, or an obscene mime copied in a hand so stately that it looks like Scripture. A group of school exercises and commentaries will inform and document the intellectual formation of the provincial elite, and a group of verse-texts the local literary production. Documentary texts have been chosen to illuminate the great transitions: the creation of the Roman province of Egypt and the enforced symbiosis of old Hellenism with the new Empire; the new world order of the early fourth century AD, and the rise of the new provincial nobility; Christian Egypt and its absorption into the empire of the Caliphs. So, in a series of petitions of the 290s, a woman struggles for justice while Emperors reconfigure the province; a Greek translation of the Digest circulates in spite of Justinian's prohibition; an account shows the Apion estate paying all staff in the employ of the provincial governor; another account reveals the new fiscal districts of Oxyrhynchus shortly after the Islamic conquest. We will also coordinate work on texts in Egyptian (Demotic and Coptic) and Arabic, which give their own glimpse of a multicultural society.\n\nEmpire and Late Antiquity, in all their complexity, have left a paper-trail in the dumps of Oxyrhynchus, and this is the trail that the project will be following.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic and public knowledge of the Graeco-Roman world, the common heritage of Europe and far beyond, is increased by three main sources of new information: archaeological finds, new inscriptions and new texts on papyrus. Publishing new papyrus texts is the primary purpose of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project. The first beneficiaries of this research project are specialists in the ancient world, but it also informs and stimulates interest among the general public. The success of the recent book of Peter Parsons on Oxyrhynchus, _City of the Sharp-nosed Fish_, is testimony to this large audience eager to learn about 'Greek Lives in Roman Egypt' and beyond.\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project and papyrology in Britain have become virtually synonymous, but the practitioners come from a plurality of nations: the project brings together researchers and students from several dozen countries in four different continents. Thus it offers a platform for inter-cultural communication, which goes beyond academic collaboration. In addition, through research on the Oxyrhynchus papyri, Britain leads the way in the understanding of the best-documented part of the ancient world, and our publications are the central point of reference.\n\nThe Oxyrhynchus papyri provide the backbone for the training of students in papyrology. The study of papyri offers a unique opportunity to anyone involved to embrace the entirety of Greek and Roman culture in its Mediterranean setting and thus does not reside exclusively in the home of tertiary education. There is keen interest in the papyri from continuing education programmes and secondary schools, and we are doing our best to respond to it by giving talks, often illustrated by original papyri, and hosting visits to the collection. The project will continue its record of hosting and directing two sixth-formers per year at the request of their schools, thus involving students learning Latin and Greek at the secondary level in the ongoing hands-on cataloguing and processing of ancient documents written in those languages.\n\nWe plan a series of public events to accompany and promote research and to disseminate its results. We hope to organize one or more workshops at the British Academy, following on the successful 'Oxyrhynchus Day', held at the Academy in June 2009, which will showcase some of our work in progress: important texts will be discussed by invited specialists, with the results to be announced in a concluding public presentation. We will include a number of texts concerning sport and spectacles in a volume to appear in 2012, the year of the London Olympic games, and will promote this publication, among non-specialists, thus increasing awareness of the ancient background to the Olympic tradition. We will continue to contribute to the outreach activities of the Egypt Exploration Society (a registered charity).\n\nA substantial web presence for the project is sustained through collaboration with the Imaging Papyri Project, which will continue to make the collection visible and all the items of each volume of papyri as it is published publicly available at http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy.\n\nThe papyri enjoy an increasing interest in the media, and have been the subject of several newspaper articles and radio and television documentaries. We expect the media interest to continue (two BBC productions involving members of the project team are being planned). We also aim to publish a number of articles about the latest published texts of particular general interest in journals and magazines for wider audiences at home and abroad.\n\nThe stories from Oxyrhynchus and its papyri feed the imagination, and have eveninspired creative writing: from Edwardian novels to Tony Harrison's _The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus_ and to a cameo appearance in Tom Stoppard's _Rock and Roll_.

These include an unknown poem on the death of Nero's wife, Poppaea, and her ascent to the stars, published in 2011; a curious document in which a boy wrestler agrees to throw his match for money, published in 2014; and a Greek recipe for a hangover cure, published in 2015. Each in its own way has enriched public appreciation of the heritage of classical culture. Three of our papyri, including one in preparation for publication, were on show in the major exhibition 'Faith after the Pharaohs' at the British Museum (2015-16), and the one on Poppaea's death will be included in the exhibition 'Nero-Emperor, Artist, and Tyrant' at Trier (May-October 2016). Two open events at the British Academy showcased our findings and ongoing research, generating an enthusiastic public response: 'Training, Cheating, Winning, Praising' (June 2012), which looked at sport and shows in Roman Egypt, using many of the texts published in our 2014 volume, and 'Pulp Fiction' (February 2015), which explored Greek popular entertainment. 'Pulp Fiction' was chronicled in the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books; the report in the LRB in turn inspired a scientist in Berlin to put the papyrus 'Homer Oracle' on line, so that you can now check your destiny at www.homeromanteion.com.
In November 2013 we mounted a small exhibition for a multicultural event celebrating the 25th anniversary of Tony Harrison's Trackers of Oxyrhynchus. Jenny Saville's exhibition 'Oxyrhynchus' (2014) contained artwork inspired by the vision of piled up paper in our excavation photographs. Papyri have a double advantage: they are both cultural salvage and buried treasure, and as such they appeal to the imagination, and enrich the perceptions, of a very various public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B006DF3-C6B0-41AA-87FF-30504BF9327C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56db10ebd46aa6.05945309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our volumes have an impact in a range of fields.

1. Greek and Latin literature. Our publication of part of Euripides' Ino (P.Oxy. LXXVIII 5131) sets reconstruction of that famous tragedy on a wholly new path. Large fragments of Menander's Misoumenos (LXXIX 5198-9) revive the study of a central text of Athenian New Comedy, demolishing many hypotheses and providing tantalizing evidence for new solutions. An extensive hitherto unknown mime text from late antiquity (LXXIX 5189) gives a vivid impression of the violence and slapstick of the genre, with characters including one addressed as a Christian priest. It opens up new avenues of research in drama and stagecraft outside the canon. A hexameter poem on the apotheosis of Nero's wife Poppaea (LXXVII 5105) has emerged as an unexpected precedent to the apotheosis in Book 2 of Martianus Capella's On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury, and provides important evidence for provincial engagement in imperial cult.

2. Ancient medicine. Volume LXXX is a milestone in the study of this field, being the largest single body of medical papyri published to date. The publication of 5224-6 doubles the number of ancient copies of Dioscorides' work on medicinal substances available to scholars, providing numerous improvements to the text transmitted by later manuscripts. Copies of major works of Hippocrates and Galen perform a similar service for those authors. 5231, part of an early commentary on Hippocrates, prompts reconsideration of the commentary tradition, giving a new insight into the largely forgotten work of Galen's predecessors. Numerous recipes and texts on surgery fill in major gaps in our knowledge of ancient practice.

3. Religious texts. The earliest copy of the Psalms in Greek (LXXVII 5101) shows a text significantly closer to the Hebrew than others, reopening larger questions concerning the earliest stage of the Greek. A copy of the church father Justin Martyr's First Apology (LXXVIII 5129) transforms the criticism of this author, suggesting that the extant manuscript is far from the authentic text. A group of twelve new 'magical' texts (LXXXII 5303-14), including Greek, Egyptian, Jewish, and Christian elements, sheds much light on developments in popular religion.

4. Roman imperial history. Several documents from the earliest years of Roman rule in Egypt greatly expand our knowledge of the transition from a Hellenistic state to a Roman province, the continuities and novelties, and the preoccupations of the new rulers; for example, we see how the regime set out to increase revenue as soon as it consolidated its power. At the other end of the spectrum, late antiquity, numerous documents give important new information on the origins and rise of the new provincial nobility, when scions of powerful local families occupied positions of authority in Constantinople. Volume LXXIX groups texts that shed light on games and festivals and their social contexts. For example, the contract 5209, in which a competitor is bribed to lose a wrestling-match, provides startling new evidence of corruption in athletics; it was published in volume LXXIX, which marked the London Olympics.

In these and other areas, scholarship profits from the the constant infusion of new primary evidence contributed by our papyri.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On the academic side, our publications will act as a spur to those working on comparable texts in other collections by providing a new context for familiar data. Newly edited collections of particular categories of texts, such as the corpus of ancient papyrus commentaries and the new corpus of Greek magical papyri, will incorporate our texts and use them to shed light on other texts of similar character. Papyrologists will take our findings on board and offer new solutions to the remaining problems of decipherment and interpretation in the texts that we have published, building on our work, while non-specialists will explore the consequences of our discoveries for the study of wider topics in ancient literature and political, cultural, and religious history.

On the non-academic side, the new papyri are now widely recognized as an important piece of our cultural heritage. We expect our findings to continue to be included in major exhibitions and disseminated in the media and in popular works on the ancient world, so enhancing public access to and appreciation of the various cultures represented.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1E7CFD94-1A68-41A5-B13E-96621339EFCB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db12a64d3f58.73695281</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D5A1D08D-6CBE-4736-9629-13FC0FF2C973</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri LXXX</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e17e95a9fa085fdbb285b97370db02e9"><gtr:id>e17e95a9fa085fdbb285b97370db02e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Leith D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978220856982224</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5461219732e967.95384862</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4072494-E82A-46EA-83D6-C60931FB06D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri LXXXII</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd2fffbb50776babb9af378af0ae0456"><gtr:id>fd2fffbb50776babb9af378af0ae0456</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gonis N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 978-0-85698-230-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d957efb9e875.32575728</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>350D4172-7316-47A4-AC76-9B4CE7E69B37</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri LXXIX</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/408e83e08ecc8e77f35a3d388de35df2"><gtr:id>408e83e08ecc8e77f35a3d388de35df2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Henry W B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978220856982194</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54612118d8ba09.17581687</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D68DDE18-E0C9-4F93-AF6E-E50AB9680C53</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri LXXVIII</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5162f8e41bdcaed7725be2f93018b966"><gtr:id>5162f8e41bdcaed7725be2f93018b966</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chang R-L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978220856982118</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5461207859e601.59486008</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42670865-D27D-4108-9822-E03218465105</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri LXXVII</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/91af1b3e8f0bf87e275820652439c574"><gtr:id>91af1b3e8f0bf87e275820652439c574</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Benaissa A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-85698-204-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54611fb06ca650.78541111</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H03997X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C97D3463-9A59-45DF-A24C-739A3B93B405</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigraphy &amp; Papyrology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
