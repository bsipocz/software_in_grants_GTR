This project will examine how European Calvinism and its texts shaped English Protestantism through investigating the making of a single set of translations that was key to the transmission of Calvinist ideas: the English Geneva Bible. The Geneva Bible was produced by Protestant exiles from Marian England, living in Geneva in a community of influential European Protestant Reformers at Calvin's church. Within this Christian humanist culture, rich in biblical scholarship and translation activities, a first edition of the Geneva Bible was produced in 1560. From 1575, with Elizabeth I on the throne, it began to be published in England, where it was printed in over 140 editions up until the 1640s. The popularity of this vernacular Bible was due in part to its unique material features: a wealth of reading aids in the form of prefaces, diagrams, extensive marginal notes, summaries and maps, and the division of the scriptures into verses for the ease of reading. Many of these features drew influence from European texts and paratexts. As a composite of these features, the Geneva Bible was the only Bible of its kind available at this time in England. Scholarship awaits a full account of the making of this materially complex, culturally influential Bible.\n\nMy project will investigate the making of the Geneva Bible, tracing its genesis and development in Geneva, exploring the influence it drew from other European translations and from the literary culture of Geneva of this time. It will begin with a study of the interactions between European Calvinism and English Protestantism, as an important background. I will examine the collaborative culture of biblical translation at Calvin's church in Geneva. I will discuss the backgrounds of the exiles constituting the community of Geneva Bible translators and trace their textual exchanges with other learned members of Calvin's church. In order to provide an original, and much needed account, of the making of the Geneva Bible, I will explore the use of Beza's Latin New Testament for the revised New Testament by Laurence Tomson, adopted by the Geneva Bible from 1576, and also of the influence of Beza's Book of Christian questions and answers (1572) on catechistical paratexts, such as 'Certaine Questions and Answers Concerning Predestination', which appear in later editions of the Geneva Bible. \n\nI will then examine ways in which the literalistic marginal notes of Lefevre's French New Testament (1523) provided an important model for the Geneva Bible's extensive marginal apparatus. The theology of the Geneva Bible marginal notes combined a Calvinist emphasis on the security of the elect, regarding salvation, with a moralistic view of faith consonant with the English Protestant tradition. I will trace motifs of predestination and apocalypse in the marginal notes, which intensify in the later New Testament translation by Laurence Tomson, and in the later annotations to Revelation by Franciscus Junius. I will situate these contextually in the literary culture of the church of the exiles making particular comparisons with the works of John Bale, and of John Olde's translation of Rudolf Gualter's Antichrist (1556). In examining how Reformers were mediating readings of the scriptures, this study will make an important contribution to the growing field of the history of reading, which has recently gained prominence. \n\nThis project will be the vital first stage in a larger study of the making and reception of the Geneva Bible in England, which I plan to undertake. The study I propose here would be complemented by further studies, beyond the term of the fellowship, which would detail the complex publication history of the Geneva Bible in England, and trace its readership and associated reading, as well as its reception in literary culture, by writers such as Spenser, Sidney and Shakespeare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Bible is arguably the most influential text to Western Civilization. The history of the Bible in this country is still an under-researched topic of significant public interest. We are soon to celebrate (in 2011) the 400th anniversary of the King James Version of the Bible. International exhibitions, conferences and public talks are planned to mark this anniversary. These events will disseminate information about this famous version of the Bible to the public, as well as to academic communities. In the wake of this revitalised consideration of the King James Bible which we will see next year I think it very important to draw attention to the important predecessor of this Bible which had so much influence upon it: The Geneva Bible. Published in over 140 editions between 1560 and 1640 the Geneva Bible continued in popularity even after the publication of the King James Version . It was the first English printed Bible to be widely circulated among lay people and to be read at home. The King James Version of the Bible is credited as a text which changed and shaped the English language, and yet 90% of its language is taken from the Geneva Bible, which in turns contains much of the language of Tyndale. \n\nIn 2007 I gave a public lecture in Edinburgh on the Geneva Bible and its Readers, as part of a programme of events to celebrate 500 years of the operation of the printing press in Scotland. This event was well-attended and a good illustration of the impact potential of this topic, which is of widespread cultural relevance and interest. \n\nMy research about the making and reception of the Geneva Bible will be of interest to both the public, and to museums/libraries who hold Geneva Bibles in their collections. There is the possibility for exhibitions about the Geneva Bible (and it's relation to the King James Version, for instance) potentially involving such institutions as The British Library, The Museum of Biblical Art in New York, and The Bible Museum in Amsterdam. The vast array of diagrams, maps and illustrations in editions of the Geneva Bible, as well as the dense printed marginalia, make this Bible of particular interest as an object of visual display. In perusing these visual aspects of the text we can learn about how Calvinism was disseminated in England, and how the translators of the Bible both made scriptures accessible to the reading public, and helped to guide interpretation. A public lecture or workshop could be given alongside such an exhibition.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55292</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J001627/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
