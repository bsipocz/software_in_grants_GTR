Thus, this proposal aims to address a key issue currently facing primary crop production in the UK, Europe and globally - the need for new effective, safe and sustainable pest control. 

In the UK and Europe, environmental concern about the use of chemical pesticides is driving a serious reduction in the number of pest control active ingredients. As a result, the agricultural sector is faced with a real challenge of how to maintain and increase food production with a vastly reduced arsenal of crop protection agents. In the last 20 years, for example, the number of chemical active ingredients allowed in crop protection fell from 1000 to 330, and this is likely to continue, as illustrated by the recent EU neonicotinoid moratorium.

This project seeks to develop novel environmentally-acceptable crop protection products that can replace the lost chemical insecticides and enhance UK and European competitiveness. The biological pesticide formulation proposed here will boost biological pest control, an already rapidly expanding sector of the crop protection market, better enabling biological crop protection products to replace the many de-registered chemicals. Biological pesticides, derived from natural pathogens of insect crop pests, are a publically acceptable group of technologies that could replace chemical pesticides. These are much cheaper to develop than either new chemicals or GM plants, and there has been a rapid growth in the market in the last decade. These biological agents are very specific pathogens of insect pest species, and major meta-studies commissioned by the EU and OECD have identified no adverse environmental issues with groups such as the insect baculoviruses, which we focus on here, and have approved their use in crop protection. However issues of the limited shelf life of current formulations and the short persistence times of the active ingredients once applied to crops restrict their cost effectiveness and discourage wider use by growers even if suitable alternative products to chemical pesticides exist.

The main goal of our study is to develop novel technology to make these biopesticides work better and to be more cost-effective, so promoting their greater use in improving crop protection and food security. By combining the biopesticide active ingredients (baculoviruses) with Entostat waxes, we aim to enhance field efficacy and increase persistence over existing formulations, so reducing the cost of using biopesticides and increasing their attractiveness to users, so making them a more viable replacement for disappearing chemical pesticides. This proof of concept project, by determining that insect viruses can be effectively encapsulated with Entostat waxes and co-formulated with other chemicals such as UV blockers, opens a whole new avenue of research on biopesticide product development that could be applied to improving the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of a wide range of biopesticides both currently used and under development.

Thus, the project has potential impact in: (i) reducing the chemical burden on the landscape, by replacing chemical pesticides with safer biological ones, so protecting ecosystem service provision; (ii) improving the cost-effectiveness of existing biological pesticides, so making crop protection more efficient in terms of labour and other inputs; (iii) through the replacement of banned chemical pesticides with biological agents, it will safeguard a range of agricultural crop systems currently struggling to survive increased pest threats; (iv) enhancing the UK economy by producing a commercial product that, if successful, is likely to generate significant income via licensing agreements and other commercial routes; and (v) expanding the UK commercial pesticide formulation sector into new product ranges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49326</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Brassica growers conference in Uk</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69BBBC69-0062-42E3-81A5-B7E5FBA2894C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave an invited talk to Biannual Meeting of UK Brassica growers on &amp;quot;Diamond back moth (DBM) , a global view on its pest status and the development of integrated pest management tools and strategies.&amp;quot; This was to inform UK brassica growers and agribusinesses of the background to the 2016 appearence of Diamondback moth as largest pest of UK brassicas and the need to adopt novel control approaches, stategy and technologies if sustainable control of this pest was to be acheived. This talk drew on my 20 years research on this previously tropica/subtropical pest in Africa and Asia that has only in the last decade appeared as a significant pest in England. This insect is rapidly breeding, damaging and adept at developing resistance to chemical pesticides so represents a major challange to UK growers. My talk was to alert UK andother north European growers present of the need to adopt Insect Resistance Managenment (IRM) approaches including the use of biological pesticides specific to DBM if safe and effective control of this pest was to be acheived and sustained. These technologies include the use of specfic insect viruses for control of DBM of the type this project is seeking to improve by augmenting the efficacy and field stability through novel formulation. 

After the talk and discussions both growers and the research funder present, Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board (AHDB) , felt my talk had made a strong case for setting up new research to look at (1) Evaluating pest status of DBM in UK (2) Developing monitoring and decision systems (3) developing appropriate IRM systems for UK growers, (4) promoting use of novel biocontrol agents for DBM. Further discussions with AHDB and growers are planned to action these issues.

The initial work so far (6 months into the project) has shown that the initial candidate formulations can be combined with baculovirus without any loss of activity so are viable for biopesticide formulation. We have gone on to identify two specfic waxes that are low cost and so are economically feasible to use in product formulation. We are now setting up long term storage trials of these formulations and validating methods for laboratory UV evaluation to determine whether they can also provide enhanced UV protection for the baculoviruses. These trials will evaluate UV stability under temperate and tropical sunlight regiomes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is planned that the developed technology would be licensed to existing biopesticide producers who already make baculovirus insectricides.
