Yet, despite a tripling of the security budget since 2001, little is known about public attitudes towards security threats, what sorts of issues ordinary people find threatening, whether they agree with, or are aware of, governments' attempts to make them feel more &amp;quot;secure&amp;quot;, and whether these attempts have any impact.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stevens and Vaughan-Williams? project is to investigate:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>how members of the public understand the concepts of &amp;quot;threat&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;security&amp;quot;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what they consider to be the most pressing threats to their security&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how and whether perceived threats to security influence other political attitudes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether their views coincide with notions of threat and how to respond to and mitigate them in the government's National Security Strategy.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research is based on 20 mini-groups of three respondents from the main regions of Britain, as well as a large-scale survey of 2000 respondents. The results will be compared and contrasted with elite representations of threat, as found in, inter alia, the National Security Strategies.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the 2008 National Security Strategy the then Labour government made a commitment to furthering dialogue with, inter alia, the public and academia in order to build a shared understanding of the security threats facing Britain today:

'We encourage interested parties to contribute to the debate on strategy, and will seek to encourage the participation of a much wider circle of expertise in addressing national security issues. [...] We will also look for new opportunities to seek views from members of the public. This strategy marks the next step in a process of engagement designed to ensure that government thinking on national security constantly keeps pace with the rapidly evolving global security environment' (HMSO, 2008: 61).

The subsequent 2010 National Security Strategy reaffirmed this commitment to recognise the contribution of individuals and communities to national security. Such an approach is also reflected in the aims of the coalition government's 'Big Society' agenda, which, indeed, paved the way for the establishment of the new National Security Council.

This project will contribute to the goal of widening public and academic engagement in the formulation and review of British security policy by gathering valuable qualitative and quantitative data about how different groups in the British public understand the concept of security threat, what they consider the greatest security threats to be, and whether or not they are aware of, agree with and/or respond in the intended direction to existing government strategies to deal with those threats. 

The findings of the research have the potential to impact on contemporary security policy by providing key government departments and agencies with a more in-depth understanding of threat perception among the British public. Because the study stratifies its respondents in terms of gender, age, region, socio-economic background, and religious beliefs, our results will offer a more nuanced understanding of public perceptions of threat than currently exists. 

The data collected and analysed will have particular benefits for key stakeholders in local and central government departments and agencies tasked with the formulation and review of security policy (e.g. Home Office, Cabinet Office, National Security Council), threat analysis and management (e.g. Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, Joint-Terrorism Analysis Centre) and public liaison (e.g. Department for Communities and Local Government, Association of Chief Police Officers, National Policing Improvement Agency). Briefings will be held in conjunction with the Royal Institute for International Affairs at Chatham House where the main findings of the project will be presented to representatives of the above user-groups. A policy paper will also be launched for wider dissemination.

In addition to these benefits, the project will also engage with various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that represent the interests of certain sectors of society whose perceptions of threat we seek to investigate (e.g. the Muslim Council of Britain, Age Concern). Other NGOs whose work intersects with the politics of threat-management and perception will also benefit from our results (e.g. Liberty, Statewatch, Human Rights Watch). Our findings will be fed to these NGOs via briefing papers and meetings on request.

A website hosted by the Universities of Exeter and Warwick will enable broader public access to the outputs of the research programme. Short presentations given by the PI and Co-I will be recorded and uploaded to our respective University's 'youtube' site. Comment pieces will also be published via the Guardian Online.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81881</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with Michael Bluett, an independent Audio-Visual artist, arose as a result of discussions held at the 'Security and the Everyday' workshop, University of Warwick, November 2013.

We presented the implications of the research for understanding contemporary attitudes towards airport border controls at the 2nd Global Automated Border Control Conference, hosted by Frontex and the EU Commission in Warsaw. Conventionally key stakeholders in EU border security have paid little attention to the differential effects of new security technologies on different groups - particularly minorities - within the travelling public. Our proposal went through a rigorous and competitive peer-review process before being accepted. A summary of our evidence was published in the final conference programme report.

Media and civil society groups:
An initial press release summarising our key findings attracted attention from several civil society groups representing Muslim communities. In particular, they were interested in our finding that terrorism is not considered to be one of the main security threats facing the British public at the community or personal levels, because the communities they represent often feel victimised as a result of latent forms of Islamaphobia being connected with the contemporary terrorist threat.
Publication of an article from your research in the British Journal of Political Science also resulted in our being invited to write a short piece for The Washington Post's Monkey Cage, which appeared in January 2016.

Public engagement:
Focus groups allow participants to express views that might not be otherwise heard and in this context they are recognised as a mechanism not only for empowering individuals, but also for new possibilities in democratising research and public engagement in policy-making. Engaging with our programme of research offered an alternative forum for members of minority groups who often feel that they are unfairly targeted by a culture of suspicion and surveillance in public spaces yet unable to voice their concerns.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2C98A9C7-C045-4302-A02F-F005F8CE6DEE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460b1f3874f45.07696179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Empirical:
? People tend not to think of security threats in national or international terms unless prompted: if elites are to take citizens' views on security threats seriously different starting points are required.
? Individuals identify different kinds of threats at the global, national, community and personal levels. This has implications for government initiatives designed to shape perceptions of security threats.
? Individuals are much more concerned with online banking and cyber-bullying than the National Security Strategy's (NSS)Tier One issue of 'hostile attacks on UK cyber space by other states and large scale cyber crime.' Other priority issues not mentioned in the NSS are financial insecurity and Islamaphobia among Muslims, which illustrates the gulf between 'official' and 'lay' knowledge of threat.
? Perceptions of more security threats tend to increase hostility towards immigrants and minorities, but perceptions of more global threats do not.
? Awareness of government messages about security threats is low and does not lessen perceptions of threats.
? Despite the 2010 NSS' commitment to building a 'much closer relationship with the public' minority groups feel powerless in the formulation of national security policy. This is potentially significant ahead of the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review.

Methods
? The mixed methods research design we used provides a new paradigm for future projects on security threats and other related issues.
? This is the first project that has examined perceptions of the breadth of security threats as well as of perceptions of specific threats such as terrorism and immigration.

Theory
? The theories developed in our articles and forthcoming book are likely to influence future theoretical progress in the field.
? The qualitative work we conducted explores what is at stake in attempting to understand the contemporary politics of threat and insecurity from the perspective of ordinary citizens rather than elites.
? The quantitative work we conducted theorizes a range of different threats, their origins and effects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non academic: Our findings could be used by policy makers as they consider the next National Security Strategy and how to work and communicate with the public as it is developed. They might also influence the ways in which politicians frame threats because framing a threat as 'global' often has different effects from framing the same threat at 'national.'
Academic: Other researchers may well replicate and extend our work using the data we have deposited with UKDS. But the findings might also be taken forward with additional multi-country research on these themes and/or additional research in the UK to examine whether they hold up three years on.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>27E2FF5B-E2FF-42BE-AF51-CCAD5DBB5D7F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460b4bac94680.67873998</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/politics/research/projects/publicperceptionsofthreatinbritain/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence submitted to UK Joint Committee on National Security Strategy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B88B4147-8B66-4AA6-BF96-2B3016D2389B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bb125d5a02.33286798</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/national-security-strategy/The%20next%20security%20strategy%20(forth%20review)/ThenextNationalSecurityStrategyEvidence18122014.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in openDemocracy report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25A8C0EF-087F-4E90-BD54-3AACC5A0705D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460a7d01f6f61.45242490</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.forceswatch.net/sites/default/files/Security_for_the_future.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Survey data from ICM online panel conducted in June 2012</gtr:description><gtr:id>44FF5626-40F1-4DD4-8E07-AE9056470216</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UKDS does not provide details of download statistics.
