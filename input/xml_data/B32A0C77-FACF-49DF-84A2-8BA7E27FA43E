The aim of this project is find out if sight loss caused by degeneration of the retina might be restored by transplantation of retinal cone photoreceptor cells grown from embryonic stem cells.

Background:

The retina is the sheet of nerves in the eye that is essential for healthy sight. The light-sensitive cells in the retina are known as photoreceptors, including rods and cones. Degeneration of these cells account for the leading causes of untreatable blindness in the UK, and the commonest condition is age-related macular degeneration which affects as many as 1 in 10 people over the age of 60 years. Most photoreceptors are rods and these cells enable sight in dimly lit conditions, but sight in normally lit conditions relies on healthy cones. Photoreceptor cells that are lost or damaged cannot regenerate and sight loss is currently irreversible. However, it might be possible to restore sight to people with retinal degeneration by providing healthy photoreceptor cells by transplantation. Previous work in the Ali laboratory has demonstrated, in 2 publications in the journal Nature, that rod-mediated sight can be restored by transplantation of rod photoreceptors from a healthy donor when the transplanted cells are at a specific age of development. More recent work in the laboratory has demonstrated that transplantation of cone photoreceptors is also possible. However, transplantation of cones is much less efficient than that of rods, possibly because only a relatively small minority of cone cells are obtained from the donor. It is important to improve the efficiency of cone photoreceptor transplantation so as realise its potential for people with blinding retinal degenerations.

Experimental plan:

Objective 1: to expand the number of healthy cones available for transplantation by promoting their growth in the laboratory from embryonic stem cells.

I propose to expand the number of cone photoreceptor available for transplantation by promoting development of cone cells in 3-dimensional laboratory culture. I will use complementary approaches to manipulate signals that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to developing photoreceptor cells. To find out if the efficiency of cone transplantation is limited by the concomitant delivery of rods, I will enrich the donor population for cones by cell sorting. These experiments will determine if cone-rich populations result in more successful cone photoreceptor transplants.

Objective 2: to transplant cone photoreceptors efficiently into the retina of healthy recipients and those with retinal disease.

Once sufficient cone photoreceptor development has been achieved in the laboratory, I will transplant this cell population into the adult healthy retina. By transplanting cells from different stages of photoreceptor development in culture I will find out which can be most efficient and most durable. Once cone transplantation is optimised in the healthy retina, I will investigate its impact in retinal degeneration by transplanting into recipients that lack normal cone photoreceptors. Given that cones constitute only a small minority of photoreceptors, valuable function might be restored with the replacement of relatively few cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim: To determine if sight loss caused by degeneration of the retina can be restored by transplantation of cone photoreceptor cells derived from embryonic stem cells.

Background: Degeneration of the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) accounts for the majority of people with untreatable blindness. Photoreceptor cells that are lost or damaged cannot regenerate, and the associated sight loss is currently irreversible. However, restoration of sight to people with retinal degeneration might be achieved by transplantation of photoreceptor cells from healthy donors. Previous work in the Ali laboratory has demonstrated that rod-mediated (dark-adapted) sight can be restored by transplantation of rod photoreceptors from a healthy donor when the transplanted cells are at a specific age of development. More recent work in the lab has shown that transplantation of cone photoreceptors, which are critical for normal sight in light-adapted conditions, is also possible. However, transplantation of cone photoreceptors is much less efficient than that of rods, possibly because only a relatively small minority of cone cells are obtained from the donor.

Research Plan: I propose to expand the number of cone photoreceptor available for transplantation by promoting development of cone cells in 3-dimensional laboratory culture from embryonic stem cells. I will use complementary approaches to manipulate signals that are both extrinsic and intrinsic to developing photoreceptor cells. To find out if the efficiency of cone transplantation is limited by the concomitant delivery of rods, I will enrich the donor population for cones by cell sorting.

Inherited retinal degenerations collectively account for a substantial burden of severe and untreatable sight impairment affecting children and young people. My aim is to help realise the potential of stem cells for retinal regeneration in these blinding conditions.

Due to the prevalence of AMD and its impact on the lives of those affected, and the excitement generated by the prospect for stem cell therapies, there is considerable interest across the research community globally in this field. The findings of the proposed project will immediately complement existing research, benefiting the academic community, health researchers and the commercial sector.

Having developed gene and cell therapy approaches for a wide range of ocular disorders and demonstrated proof of principle in clinical application, Professors Ali and Bainbridge have the relevant expertise and infrastructural resources to translate relevant findings into new interventions for the benefit of patients. It is anticipated that development of a new cell intervention from preclinical proof of concept to clinical application will take approximately 5 years.

In the long term, if a clinical application is developed, patients will benefit by having a potentially more effective treatment. This would positively affect quality of life while decreasing the morbidity associated with this condition. Development of new modalities may benefit policy-makers, governments and government agencies by providing a potentially more cost-effective approach to the treatment of this condition. This is important when considering the ageing demographic and its impact on healthcare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Polymeric Scaffolds Possessing Peptide-Gradients as Bruch's Membrane Mimetics for Implantation of Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells</gtr:description><gtr:id>1287D013-F448-443C-9BD7-9BEA8293B825</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.
