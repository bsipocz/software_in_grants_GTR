When this goes wrong it can be lethal for the cell, or even lead to cancer. To prevent such errors the cell is able to stop and wait in the middle of dividing if it detects that any of its chromosomes are not being pulled to the middle of the cell by a machine called the mitotic spindle. It is only when all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle that the cell goes on to divide its chromosomes. We are investigating this process and in particular the mechanism that links how the cell detects whether chromosomes are attached to the spindle to the engine that drives cells through mitosis. We would like work out how the 'brake' on the engine is removed when all the chromosomes are attached. This mechanism is the target of a number of anti-cancer drugs, therefore, a better understanding of how this mechanism works should help to design better drugs with fewer side-effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is the major checkpoint during mitosis and ensures proper chromosome segregation 1. The SAC prevents the APC/C, the essential ubiquitin ligase that controls mitosis, recognising Cyclin B1 and securin. The SAC works by incorporating Cdc20 into a complex with specific SAC proteins (the Mad and Bub proteins) that subsequently binds to the APC/C and targets Cdc20 for degradation. We have recently found that inactivation of the SAC complex on the APC/C requires two steps. In the first step a specific subunit of the APC/C, APC15, is required to release the Mad2 from the SAC but not for APC/C activity against its major mitotic substrates (Cyclins A and B1 and securin). A second, ATP-dependent, step then releases the remaining SAC complex from the APC/C. With these insights we intend to address the following questions: 1) Which components of the SAC complex are recognised by the APC/C in the first step? 2) How is the SAC complex released form the APC/C in the second step? 3) Can we generate a model for the SAC and the APC/C using in vivo kinetic data?</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to understand a fundamental process in the control of mitosis. We aim to discover how the essential Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) regulates, and is regulated by, its target, the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). In particular we wish to build on our recent results to understand how the SAC complex is eventually inactivated in an APC/C-dependent manner. The SAC arrests cells in response to unattached kinetochores and this of great therapeutic value because it is the means by which the taxanes and vinca alkaloids kill cells in cancer therapy. Cells arrested in mitosis for long periods either slip out of mitosis by degrading cyclin B1 and securin, or trigger apoptosis. Recently, the Mitchison laboratory showed that arresting cancer cells in mitosis for extended periods improved the efficiency with which they triggered apoptosis whereas normal cells remained viable (Huang et al., 2009, Cancer Cell 16, p347-358). Therefore, understanding how the SAC is inactivated by APC/C-dependent activity could improve our ability to kill cancer cells preferentially over normal cells. In the course of this research we will also develop cell lines and assays that should be very useful to other researchers in the same and related fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>293248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our work has been cited 61 times (Google scholar) since it was published.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2F7A32B2-3FA0-4A0D-BBE0-14758ED789CD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5449091f92c3e9.21815596</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have followed up our finding that Cdc20 binds to a different site on the APC/C when it is bound to the mitotic checkpoint complex compared to when it binds as a co-activator. We have found that binding to this site in the absence of the APC15 subunit 'locks' the checkpoint complex onto the APC/C and prevents its disassembly. More specifically we think that this is because the Mad2 subunit cannot leave the complex. We are currently attempting to elucidate the pathway by which this complex is disassembled.

In parallel, we have developed an assay to measure the 'strength' of the spindle assembly checkpoint and have correlated this with the numbers of kinetochores that recruit Mad2, and are using these findings to generate a computational model for the checkpoint. These results were published as Collin et al., 2013 in Nature Cell Biology.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has implications for understanding the therapeutic effect of spindle poisons.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2A1CF645-07AE-450A-9CF3-08392392103F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8538282912.72584677829daa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/v15/n11/full/ncb2855.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have used homologous recombination to introduce a fluorescent protein tag into the Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 genes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>409A2BB7-513E-4362-A72C-144414AD3E1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These cell lines allow one to assay APC/C activity in vivo</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54491366c85305.40056801</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Gene targeted cell lines for APC/C substrates</gtr:title><gtr:type>Cell line</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836401/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0A1AD52F-89F8-481A-9F9C-3F328ADCF184</gtr:id><gtr:title>The spindle assembly checkpoint works like a rheostat rather than a toggle switch.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature cell biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fbf1310db06abd20f6f7e699be74014c"><gtr:id>fbf1310db06abd20f6f7e699be74014c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Collin P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1465-7392</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>543d2b47958554.07744136</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I022376/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
