While much has been made of his adaptation into cinema and theatre, radio and television have been overlooked. There is an erroneous presumption that one adaptive strategy fits all forms. This project brings the television and radio adaptations of the novelist's work out of the shadow of their cinematic and theatrical counterparts, underlining their very distinct adaptive approaches and the way in which they cast new light on their source. It is not for nothing that television and radio adaptations of this novelist are so plentiful. Both media, with their serial structures and popular reach are uniquely suited to the adaptation of this novelist who, intrigued by the possibilities of different media and the power of serial forms, reworked his narratives for the broadest audiences possible.\n \nRadio offers Zola a wide audience. It is, though, one of the most ephemeral of media, not publicly catalogued in Britain. This project brings to light untapped archival resources by collating in a web page the adaptations of Zola's texts aired on British and French radio. These nations offer a powerful case study as a result of the frequency with which they adapt Zola's texts, their very different national adaptive strategies and the privileged space they afford radio drama. The web page also publishes interviews with dramatists, commissioning editors, actors and producers responsible for the adaptations. It does so to bring the practical, commercial constraints of the process into play in academic discussions which tend to ignore them. Interviews have already been conducted with dramatist Diana Griffiths and are planned with dramatist Hattie Naylor, producer Pauline Harris and actor Toby Haydoke. The web page will open the study of Zola and radio as a new area of research by making clear for the first time the author's impact on this medium. I have been commisioned by the editors of Dix-Neuf to act as guest editor for a special number on Zola and radio (2013) and am due to submit an article on the topic to French Studies Bulletin in 2012.\n\nTelevision has a more clearly available archive in relation to Zola, yet that archive has largely been ignored by critics who elide the strategies of this medium with those of its more acclaimed counterpart, cinema. This project rectifies this in the first book-length study on Zola and television. It uses ten public- and private-channel French adaptations in comparison with British counterparts to underline that television adaptations differ starkly from their cinematic colleagues and offer a more natural home for Zola's texts in three key respects. First, if cinema adaptations preserve Zola for a dedicated art-house audience, television returns him to the populist audience which was his when his works first appeared in serial form and subsequently in cheap editions. Second, serial television can recreate, in a way that cinema cannot, the cyclical structures of Zola's texts and the twenty-novel series to which they belong. British adaptations of canonical writers have, by and large, gone in quest of heritage, seeking to return to the past. Adaptations created in France update the past into a modern context, echoing Zola's view of fiction as an age-old story retold in new contexts. Finally, television adaptations produce a very different Zola from cinema. The sweeping panoramas of cinema and Zola's novels frequently disappear in television, victims of its smaller budgets and different aesthetic. Traditionally television adaptations have relied on 4:3 boxy interior shots in studio-produced pieces heavy with dialogue. If television crops Zola's panoramas, it brings us closer to Zola's intention to provide, in close-up, a dissection of the characters' entrapment as they struggle beneath the weight of their heredity, era and environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is hoped that this project will enjoy multiple impacts across the nations discussed in the study, within the creative industries, in the public sphere, potentially within the museum sector, within the academic communities discussed in the previous section as well as in teaching contexts. \n\nThe project's initial impact will be on the creative industries themselves. The project will offer essential exposure to the largely untapped body of their adaptations of Zola in radio and television. The radio web page will offer a key outlet for the hidden voices in the production of such radio adaptations in the form of interviews with adaptors, producers, commissioning editors, actors and listeners to these works. Such interviews not only allow these practical voices to feed into academic debates, they also offer a forum and resource for successive adaptors of Zola and the creative industries more generally. Adaptors in radio and television usually work in isolation, making no contact with the work of their predecessors. This project offers the possibility of changing that. Similarly, the monograph, which contains a list of British and French television radio adaptations and interviews their personnel, speaks to issues of form and production current in contemporary cultural production.\n\nIt is intended that the project will also have an impact on the general public. Radio listener groups such as Diversity and the Vintage Radio Programme Collectors' Circle attempt to catalogue the unarchived output of the BBC. Their very existence testifies to the need for this project. I have been greatly helped by such groups and my work will, in return, feed into their web-based archiving and debate. Zola, although now canonical, has always enjoyed a popular fan base beyond the ivory towers of academia. He retains that fan base to this day as the existence of bodies such as the Emile Zola Society of London, a society run by the general public and dedicated to Zola's cultural importance, makes clear. Zola, as a writer, has never been confined solely to the academic sphere and neither should any project on him be. I have recently applied to the AHRC/BBC Radio 3 New Generation Thinkers scheme, pitching a programme designed precisely to bring the impact of this project into a broad public forum. \n\nThe project enjoys a further potential impact in relation to two museums: the National Media Museum in Bradford and the Emile Zola Museum in M&amp;eacute;dan. I have made initial contact with both museums to discuss the possibility of mounting an exhibition on multimedia Zolas using the findings of this project and my previous book on Zola and cinema. Zola, a key figure on the syllabus of University French departments, an ever relevant figure on the syllabus of secondary schools as a result of his role in the Dreyfus affair and one of the towering names in the British and French cultural consciousnesses, offers a potentially powerful draw for museum audiences. \n\nIn addition, I teach adaptation at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, collaborating with a series of other British institutions as part of the ARTT research cluster. It is hoped that this monograph and web page will have an educational impact, becoming core resources for those teaching adaptation in departments of Media, Modern Languages or English, enabling them to move their focus beyond theatre and cinema to consider radio and television.\n\nLegenda have requested the book manuscript for Zola and Television for consideration based on a belief that the proposed volume will sell well both in Britain, France and North America, bridging academic interest, the purchasing trends of British and North-American libraries generally and the public thirst for television recreations of canonical texts as a whole. The public reach of the website will extend still further than the monograph given the web page'</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43180</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My research on this AHRC funded project led to me being hired as academic consultant on the year-long adaptation of Zola's novels for BBC Radio 4.
