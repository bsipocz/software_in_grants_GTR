There are three elements to the project. 
First, a research review of the literature surrounding the emergence of 'active citizenship' amongst liberal academics will explore how the value of the humanities in the education of citizens was negotiated and appraised in the long nineteenth century. If the first mechanics' institutes established in the 1820s had been motivated by the paternalistic concerns of philanthropists, after 1848 educational institutions were increasingly promoted by 'men of letters' and university liberals, motivated by a strong sense of social duty. Spanning between 1854 and 1914 - from the Christian Socialist experiment of the Working Men's College to the establishment of secular university settlements in East London - the review will initially seek to shed some light on what Victorians understood by 'active citizenship', as they replaced technical subjects; once taught in mechanics' institute; with courses on literature, art, moral philosophy, classical and modern languages. For many liberal academics 'active citizenship' meant giving time, knowledge and expertise to the co-operative movement, which also had education at its heart. Mining archives to collect visual and non visual material, this phase will address the following research questions: how did 'active citizenship' distinguish itself from philanthropy? What were the connections and networks which were established? What were the main challenges? How did the discourse on 'active citizenship' and the civic engagement of 'men of letters' evolve between the mid-nineteenth century and the outbreak of the First World War? 
The second part of the project will involve engaging in consultations with representatives of non-academic communities - experts in further education, co-operative archivists and librarians, representatives of the community in East London - to test and debate ways to re-evaluate the wealth of experience in 'active citizenship' offered by the Victorian model and, subsequently, by the Workers' Educational Association in Edwardian Britain. 
The third part of the project will draw on the potential of the digital humanities and social media to re-establish a network of connection between HE, FE, co-operatives and local communities by creating a virtual community where issues relating to 'active citizenship', public engagement and the role of the humanities in civil society may be debated beyond the strictly academic circles and opportunities for future collaborations may be sought. This final stage will involve disseminating the findings of the research via an online exhibition and establishing an open forum for discussions on what preserving the memory of 'active citizenship' may mean for the humanities today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research into the Victorian model of 'active citizenship?
Direct beneficiaries
Amongst the direct beneficiaries will be a registered charity, Toynbee Hall. This will benefit from the potential of an exhibition aimed at raising the profile of 'active citizenship' viewed in historical perspective. Another stakeholder which will be directly involved in the outputs of the research will be the Bishopsgate Institute, which has a vital role in supporting the community in the East End, where it holds regular cultural events. The outputs of the research will provide the Bishopsgate Institute with an opportunity to display widely some of the archival material that it holds. Finally, researching co-operatives within the Co-operative College; which carries out both contemporary and historical research on the role of co-operatives; will also benefit from the new perspective into the history of co-operation which will derive from the research into 'active citizenship'.
Further indirect beneficiaries / users which will be interested in the research outputs include:
The Charity &amp;quot;Involve&amp;quot;, (funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust amongst others) which gathers experts in public engagement, participation and dialogue, and carries out research work on inspiring citizens and embedding public engagement in government. Amongst the most recent publications of the charity is a report, Pathways through Participation: what creates and sustains active citizenship?
Interested parties will also include researchers working within leading centres for education studies. These include :
the Institute of Education (OIE), which holds conferences and events and commissions research focusing on education in London (E.g. London Education Research Unit research fellowships, also concerned with social cohesion and citizenship). The outputs of the project will stimulate new debates and provide the impetus for new research questions such as 'What does 'active citizenship' mean to emerging leaders?'
The National Institute for Adult and Continuing Educations (NIACE), which aims to encourage all adults in engaging in learning of all kinds. The group has an active role in influencing public policy, advancing the case for adult learning. NIACE supports networking with practitioners, policy- makers and researchers and is at the centre of consultations and calls for evidence issued by government departments, committees, enquiries and other organisations. 
Potential for long term impact
The impact will be measured by the ability of the new website, 'Active citizenship', to penetrate across different sectors of the community. The activity/use of the website will be monitored by using Google Analytics which will track traffic sources, number of visits, pages visited, top pages viewed, bounce rate, etc. This will be an important tool to measure the outcomes of the project. Long term beneficiaries of the widening of this debate will depend on the priorities set by the 'Active citizenship' forum online discussions, which will include partners from different sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>7 April 2016 Thomas Ashby, G.M Treveyan and the British Red Cross:Humanities Acitivists in Italy's Great War, Rome, British School at Rome</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FFE8602-AF49-4466-961F-CD1DEA5EB350</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk at the British School in Rome further explored the activities of the third Director of the School, the pacifist Thomas Ashby, and the Cambridge historian G.M.Trevelyan, when the two organised a Red Cross Ambulance Unit to help the wounded at the front - following Italy's entry in the war, in May 1915.

As 'humanities activists' based in the North-east of Italy, British volunteers played a significant, though somewhat unusual part, in the transnational context of humanitarian aid. The great historian G.M.Trevelyan - the historian of Garibaldi and the Unification of Italy, whose deeply influenced generations - joined the Director of the British School in Rome, Thomas Ashby - a pacifist and a conscientious objector - in organizing a Red Cross Ambulance Unit which served on the Italian front.

This included adult education for 'working men', and the Workers Educational Association (WEA, est. 1903) - the topic of Mr C. H. Lee's Cambridge PhD student (supervised by Professor Biagini) - is an eminent example. Lee shows how the whole philosophy of the WEA in its first two decades was a projection of 'New Liberal' ideas of civic involvement. Over the past two years we have felt the need to expand both the chronological timespan (which now covers the twentieth century) and the definition of the field of inquiry (which now covers Ireland as well as Britain). The First World War was a particularly important turning point, because the need to mobilise human and economic resources resulted in the development of new initiatives and strategies, as well as changes in the relationship between curricula and the creation of civic awareness. Moreover, Lee shows how such ideas were gradually replaced by a concern to provide professional training and better employment prospects for WEA students, and how such 'professional ideal' eroded the original emphasis on civic values and participatory citizenship. In separate developments, research conducted by Masters students working under Professor Biagini's supervision has shed new light into how the First World War affected private schools' attitudes to 'nation', patriotism, gender roles and international relations. 
Another way in which this project has grown and expanded beyond its original remit is in terms of its focus. The original focus was on Britain. Over the past two years we have felt the need to expand the field of inquiry to include Ireland as well as Britain. Again, the First World War was felt to be a particularly important turning point. In Ireland - which from 1912 entered a critical phase of its history, which was to result in the first partition of the United Kingdom in 1920-22 - the link between education, active citizenship and nation building became the battleground between opposing visions of the national identity and its future, with the government, the Unionist education establishment and the radical educational reformers such a Patrick Pearse, developing alternative, competing approaches to such link. This clash reached its climax during the war and particulalry with the Easter Rising. has resulted in the publication of a book of essays, The Shaping of Modern Ireland (2016), and is informing ongoing research by professor Biagini and some of his students, particularly Stella Isaac.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are now working on the inter-war period, the deepening of Ireland's partition, the alienation between Britain and Ireland (both South and North), and the role played by education in these developments.
