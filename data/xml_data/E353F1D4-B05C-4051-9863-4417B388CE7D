sensor-based detection system in addressing a significant global meat production problem that impacts on animal health
and welfare, and human health. Campylobacter jejuni, the most frequently reported food-borne pathogen associated with
human illness in the UK, causes over 460,000 reported cases of campylobacteriosis annually, leading to over 22,000
hospitalisations and 100 deaths, at a cost to the UK government of over &amp;pound;900 million. While substantial research funding
has been invested by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) and other organisations across the farm to fork continuum, the
industry is currently focussed on Campylobacter reduction using carcass processing interventions such as rapid surface
chilling rather than on farm-level interventions which would serve to prevent/reduce the substantial impact C. jejuni infection
has recently been estimated to have on animal health and welfare in intensively farmed poultry.
The aim of this research is to develop a commercially viable on-farm real time portable sampling and detection tool to
determine the Campylobacter status of flocks during production and prior to slaughter. The preliminary research to be
carried out by this team will use an appropriate extraction system in synergy with GC-MS technology to capture and identify
unique volatiles released through the metabolic activities of Campylobacter. Determination of detectable levels of known
Campylobacter-associated volatiles will be investigated using several species and strains of Campylobacter in pure culture
and in the presence of a range of different background materials (e.g. chicken faeces; litter) at different stages of growth.
Screening for Campylobacter-associated volatiles in chicken (and possibly other poultry) faecal material using confirmed
Campylobacter-positive and -negative samples will also be conducted, including PCR identiication of isolates as required.
The unique volatiles identified by GC-MS will then be used to optimise the sensor, and on-farm detection will be re-evaluated
using adsorbents containing trapped volatiles. The Harper Adams team will utilise a competent, post-doctoral
analytical chemist who will be supported by Dr Lynn McIntyre with her wealth of knowledge on Campylobacter biology and
by Dr Frank Vriesekoop who brings expertise in pathogen physiology and the application of analytical chemistry and
method development.
A number of potential applications and benefits are associated with the development of this testing platform which could
extend beyond the single issue of Campylobacter detection in poultry to multiple target pathogens/analytes of relevance to
crops and animals such as E. coli O157, Salmonella, mycotoxins and botrytis, and detection of specific diseases such as tuberculosis and mastitis. In relation to this specific application, the development of a hand held air sampling device
capable of instantaneously detecting the presence of Campylobacter would offer a real time detection method not currently
available to the poultry industry which could be applied at various points in the poultry production chain, from hatchery
through farm production and processing, to the retail level. The ability to make simple frequent measurements to
accurately pinpoint disease onset would enable farm/area mangers to identify potential links to farm activities and biosecurity practices, which is not currently possible using pathogen culture or PCR protocols. Likewise, such a detection system could be used during processing to assess the impact of carcass reduction strategies. Empowering poultry industry staff to make changes that can reduce the incidence of Campylobacter in poultry destined for the retail market would ultimately result in the greatest benefit; that of a reduction in public health burden associated with this zoonotic pathogen.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This research proposal specifically targets Campylobacter infection of broiler chickens to demonstrate the utility of this sensor-based detection system in addressing a significant global meat production problem that impacts on animal health and welfare, and human health.

* The project research team;
* UK and international academic and research organisations working in the area of Campylobacter infection/contamination
of poultry (see academic beneficiaries section);
* Commercial private sector poultry companies and retailers;
* Policy-makers, within international, national, local and government agencies;
* The wider public as food consumers.
The project team will benefit directly from involvement in the proposed consortium comprised of professionals with a
diverse set of skills ranging from project management through microbiology and chemistry analytical techniques to
advanced technology, data handling and industry application experience. Participation in this project will also put the
Harper Adams team in a strong position to promote and develop this technology for other animal and crop diseases,
potentially in collaboration with colleagues in the Animals and Crops Departments, and with other UK and international
academic and research collaborators.
The work being proposed here will be progressed in collaboration with Banham Poultry Ltd., an independent family
business with a turnover of approximately &amp;pound;100m per year and sales of 650,000 chickens per week. There are a number of
practical benefits associated with adoption of this technology by this company including identifying potential links to day-today
farm activities and biosecurity practices, and knowing the disease status of flocks prior to slaughter which will allow
them to schedule positive flocks to the end of the slaughter window to eliminate cross-contamination. Where certain
processing interventions (such as rapid surface chilling) may be implemented in the future, knowing the Campylobacter
status of flocks would allow interventions to be &amp;quot;turned on/turned off&amp;quot; as required, rather than keeping them &amp;quot;turned on&amp;quot;,
potentially resulting in cost savings. Proactive use of thetechnology being proposed in this application could also give
companies such as Banham a competitive advantage in the retail market, and allow retailers to promote the sale of &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;
poultry meat from such suppliers.
There are of course many other UK (and international) poultry companies that would benefit from the implementation of an
on-farm detection system for Campylobacter (and other pathogens). The potential to monitor chemicals such as ammonia
emissions from poultry houses could also be appealing to poultry companies looking to expand production at existing sites
rather than trying to get permission for new farms.
Ultimately, expected improvements in Public Health would benefit all stakeholders in the poultry production chain including,
importantly, the wider public end user. The FSA's target to reduce cases of campylobacteriosis by 50% would, for example,
result in a reduced cost to the UK government of &amp;pound;450 million. In many countries, including the UK, New Zealand and
Australia, significant funding has also being invested by regulators and the poultry industry to reduce Campylobacter
contamination of poultry. There are therefore significant international opportunities to be gleaned from this research which will potentially contribute to cost savings, and the potential to refocus Campylobacter reduction at the farm level rather than
further along the food chain. It is anticipated that a commercial detection system will be produced as a direct output of this
multidisciplinary research project within a 3 - 4 year period which could conceivably develop a new approach to routine
Campylobacter detection techniques, positively change current on-farm attitudes and (biosecurity) practices of poultry
industry staff, enhance the health and well-being of consumers, and contribute a significant quantity of valuable on-farm
research data to organisations such as the FSA and Defra to inform future policy decision-making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Food Safety Conference (Indonesia)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A39253A-ADAB-4162-BC39-1736D16707B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Lynn McIntyre presented a talk entitled &amp;quot;Improving Poultry Meat Safety by On-farm Detection of Human Pathogens&amp;quot; at the UK-Indonesia Symposium on Engineering, Energy, Environmental Sustainability and Food Security 2015, Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia.
