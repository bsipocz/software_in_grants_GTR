Each adrenal gland is anatomically and functionally composed of two distinct parts, an outer cortex and inner medulla. The adrenal cortex is essential for life: it produces glucocorticoids that regulate body metabolism, and mineralocorticoids that affect blood pressure. Adrenal cortex disorders can cause your adrenal glands to produce too much or not enough hormones; some disorders can be determined by genetic mutations. 

Adrenal studies are usually carried out by using cell lines established from tumors or cell lines transfected with a gene of interest: both systems have several drawbacks such as the inability to produce a full steroid profile or the inherent difficulty to extrapolate physiologically relevant data from an over-expression system. Animal models are also frequently used to investigate the development, function and pathology of adrenal glands, as well as for testing new treatments and for toxicology studies. However some animal models obtained through knockout technology fail to generate the human disease (Triple-A syndrome and NNT dependent-Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency are two examples in the adrenal field). 

Cell reprogramming techniques are becoming powerful tools for replacing animal models and procedures as well as for studying the cause of a particular disease and for drug testing. Cellular reprogramming describes the process where a fully differentiated, specialized cell type is induced to transform into a different cell type that it would not otherwise become under normal physiological conditions. Cellular reprogramming has been achieved using a variety of methods, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell-cell fusion and, most recently, through the introduction of transcription factors. Two scientists, Sir John Gordon of Britain and Shinya Yamanaka of Japan were awarded the Nobel Prize for the category Physiology and Medicine in 2012 for their groundbreaking discoveries in the field. Gordon's research was conducted in 1962 and showed that it was possible to reverse the specialization of cells. By transferring a nucleus from a frog's intestinal cell into a frog's egg cell that had its nucleus removed, he was able to obtain a tadpole. Building on Gordon's work, Yamanaka published a paper in 2006 demonstrating that mature murine cells can become immature stem cells (called inducible pluripotent stem cells, IPSCs) by expressing genes encoding four transcription factors. IPSCs can be differentiated to several tissues using specific protocols. Yamanaka's breakthrough opened the door to studying disease and developing diagnosis and treatments. Recently, the generation of a cell type from an unrelated cell type without the need of an IPSCs intermediate has been described by using specific cell fate-transcription factors. This process has been named lineage conversion. 

Regardless of the method used, skin fibroblasts have been a predominant source material so far but an invasive surgical procedure (skin biopsy) is required to establish primary cells, and not always possible. A blood draw would be an ideal starting point to obtain donor-specific cells because it is minimally invasive and established procedures are already in place for acquisition and handling. In fact, scientists have recently employed this patient-friendly way to establish long-term in vitro culture of blood-derived cells, and importantly, they have been able to reprogram efficiently these cells into IPSCs. One of these cell types are late-outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (L-EPCs).

With this proposal, I aim at developing a technology whereby L-EPCs are reprogrammed to acquire an adrenocortical phenotype using lineage conversion, by forcing the expression of single cell fate regulator, Steroidogenic Factor 1.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The adrenal cortex is the primary site of steroid synthesis and controls essential metabolic processes. 

The ability to generate an individual-specific cell platform through the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells or lineage conversion offers a new paradigm for functional studies, for modeling human disease and for drug testing. There is an unmet need for developing such technology in the adrenal field, as current in vitro systems are not physiologically relevant and some animal models do not phenocopy the adrenal disease . Lineage conversion, a direct reprogramming of an adult cell into another differentiated lineage (without passage through an undifferentiated pluripotent stage) is a new area of research that has emerged alongside induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming. Indeed, this line of investigation has begun to play a key role in basic biology research and regenerative medicine as several clinically relevant cell types have been reprogrammed, even from distantly related lineages (different germ layer origin).

The aim of this proposal is to lineage convert late-outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (L-EPCs, obtained from a simple venipuncture) into an adrenocortical phenotype, by forcing the expression of Steroidogenic Factor 1. Reprogrammed L-EPCs will be assessed by their ability to fulfill stringent criteria such as the expression of adrenal cortex specific genes, and the acquisition of the functional integrity of adrenal cortex specific signaling pathways. A final proof-of-concept stage will assess the occurrence of known cellular defects associated with Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency (FGD) in reprogrammed L-EPCs established from three cohorts of different FGD patients.

The versatility of this in vitro platform makes it well suitable for the study of adrenal cortex physiology and pathology as well as for drug testing. It will also be an important first step in the field of regenerative medicine.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ability to reprogram blood-derived cells into adrenocortical cells for use as novel in vitro platforms to study adrenal physiology, adrenal pathophysiology and for drug testing has the capacity to make substantial impact on our knowledge on the adrenal gland, on the 3Rs, industry, staff training and public perception of science. 

The beneficiaries are:

1) General public with an interest in stem cell research and novel regenerative medicine applications. The use of stem cell in the context of personalized medical applications is the subject of many debates and expectations amongst the general public these days and I know for experience that a good proportion of the UK population is aware that stem cell research is being pursued in the hope of achieving major medical breakthroughs. This study (and clearly others that are focused on stem cells) will be important in enhancing the cultural enrichment in stem cell research. Although this study employs adult somatic stem cells, which are less controversial than human embryonic stem cells, stimulating discussions regarding ethical considerations are still possible and those should be divulged to the public.

2) The UK economy (preclinical setting): research findings arising from this project have the potential to stimulate investments of companies, and University spin-offs (in the UK and overseas). Examples: new treatments to restore MC2R/MRAP trafficking in patients with FGD, modeling all the genetic diseases affecting the adrenal cortex, the testing of novel AT1R (hypertension) and MC2R (Cushing's) antagonists, the study of non-cell autonomous mechanisms of disease using novel and more accurate in vitro methods. 

3) The UK government (through BBSRC, NC3Rs), various UK charities (such as Dr Hadwen trust), the US FDA are all strong advocate of methodologies for the refinement, reduction, and replacement of animal tests with alternative methodologies that do not employ the use of animals. Animal research has provided valuable information about many physiological processes that are relevant to humans and has been fundamental in the development of many drugs, including vaccines, anesthetics, and antibiotics; however there is the need to develop and employ new technologies that are typically more sophisticated and specific to humans than traditional approaches to testing in whole animal. 
For example, the use of patient-specific SF1-L-EPCs will replace &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 100 animals for each novel gene discovered and will replace the need to create some transgenic lines with intrinsic phenotypes associated to the their generation or as a consequence of pharmacological treatments (glucocorticoid deficiency, mineralocorticoid deficiency, mineralocorticoid excess, adrenal hyperplasia, hypertension, hypokalemia, glucose intolerance, short life-span, stress, changes in reproductive function etc), all of which cause chronic discomfort.

4) The UK economy (transferable skills): by the end of the grant, a high-calibre postdoctoral research assistant and a number of research students will be in a position to contribute to the UK economy as they'll possess important transferable skills.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>368954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Technical University of Dresden</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Assessment of adrenocortical function of human induced-steroidogenic cells (iSCs) in rodent models of adrenal insufficiency</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5960E4E-97DB-41E5-8C34-EC186723DE80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data obtained with collaborators is being finalised for publication (Cell Set Cells).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b998418ec047.67102892-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Double adrenalectomy in mice, intra kidney capsule injection of cells or slabs, intra-adrenal injection.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Generation of iSCs, encapsulation into alginate slabs</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit from patients</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4469190-B67F-40C5-A1D5-A22A73039BE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Starting from 2016, we have been collected blood, urine and skin from patients with congenital adrenal diseases for disease modelling.
