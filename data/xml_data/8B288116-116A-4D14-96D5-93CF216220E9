The contrast between the 'sullen art' of some of his early lyrics on the one hand, and the radio personality, recording artist, film scriptwriter, and author of 'Fern Hill' and Under Milk Wood on the other, is reflected in the disparity between his popularity with the general reading public and the relatively low esteem he has enjoyed among academics and literary journalists since the mid-1970s. By the latter he is regarded as an 'excessive', uncontrolled writer, a literary dead-end who had no influence, and as irrelevant to the most important currents in twentieth century British poetry. However my own research, conducted over more than a decade, has led me to conclude that, far from being a neo-Romantic Thomas is first and foremost a modernist-influenced poet whose rhetorical strategies are aimed at producing radical ambiguity, the founder of a strain of an existential-apocalyptic tradition in British poetry which has had a profound, if hidden influence on the present via W. S. Graham, Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. 

The chief problem is that the detailed work of leading critics working on Thomas in the 1950s and 1960s - Winifred Nowottny, William T. Moynihan, William Empson, J. Hillis Miller, and John Bayley - was not built on after 1970. The turning-point in Thomas's critical-academic fortunes, which had been buoyant for two decades, came after W. H. Auden's death in 1973, and the rise of a conservative, anglocentric cultural climate in England (what Hugh Kenner called the 'sinking island syndrome'). Asserting Auden's status as a 'major' poet by way of cultural compensation for post-imperial decline, the 1930s were configured as 'the Age of Auden', and this required the sidelining of alternatives to Auden, of whom Thomas was the most significant. Thus, the standard histories of 1930s writing, by Samuel Hynes (1976) and Valentine Cunningham (1988), virtually exclude Thomas, even though two-thirds of his poetry appeared between 1934 and 1939. Effectively redescribed as a 1940s-only poet, his reputation suffered from the post-Movement dogma that this period was a 'dire decade' for poetry. Equally, a growing nationalist current in Anglo-Welsh literary studies meant that Thomas, while central to the canon, was perceived as anomalous to it because his work did not offer allegories of national self-realisation; nor did his hybrid refusal of fixed identity and blatant lack of guilt at being an anglophone writer, help in this respect. 

The result is that today even critics wishing to re-examine Thomas's poetry are unsure about its true significance, and how to interpret and place it. The new centenary edition of the poems is aimed at helping them do that, and at enabling the general reader to tackle poems which are tougher than the anthology staples, but equally beautiful and profound. It will make available the forgotten insights of earlier critics, but chiefly it will draw on my own research to present the poems in a way which reveals what they offer a contemporary audience - how they inventively ride the slippages of language, blur gender and existential boundaries, explore the religious impulse, subvert fixed identities, and map the relationship between the body and the conscious and unconscious mind. The aim is to offer a fuller, more nuanced and immediate grasp of the wit and daring of Thomas' work while respecting its necessary opacity. By substantiating the claim for Thomas's importance in these ways it is hoped to add to the challenge currently being made by critics such as James Keery, Leo Mellors and Andrew Duncan to the standard narratives about 1930s and 1940s poetry, and to fruitfully problematise the nature of Welsh, Anglo-Welsh, and British identities in literature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is intended that this research will have multiple non-academic impacts, on the poetry-reading public, and those interested in twentieth century literature more generally. While the primary impacts will be in the UK, the USA and the rest of the anglophone world, Thomas is one of the few British twentieth century poets with an international reach and recognition factor, and he has been translated into more languages than any twentieth century British poet except T. S. Eliot. (Dylan Thomas societies exist in Japan and Poland as well as Canada and Australia, and recent translations include that of Under Milk Wood into Catalan.)

The impact of the edition will be maximised in the following ways through a variety of media (print, public lecture / seminar, radio, television) in the period September 2013 - 2015:

* Multiple publisher-organised launch events (in London, Swansea, Cardiff, and New York).
* Lectures / presentations at public poetry venues in the UK (the National Poetry Library and Poetry Cafe in London, Morden Tower, Seamus Heaney Poetry Centre, etc.). This to include discussions with the Poet Laureate, Carol Anne Duffy, the National Poetry Society and the editor of Poetry Review concerning collaboration on events to promote the new edition and celebrate the centenary.
* Lectures at leading poetry and literary festivals (Cheltenham, Hay-on-Wye, Aldeburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, Belfast, St Andrews, Bridport, London, Cardiff, etc.).
* Radio / television interviews and magazine articles (e.g.: with BBC television [including BBC Wales], concerning placement on programmes such as The Late Review, Radio 3 and Radio 4 literature and poetry programmes, such as The Verb, and the World Service.
* Participation in the events being planned for the Welsh Assembly-sponsored celebration of the centenary of Dylan Thomas's birth in October-November 2014.
* Lectures within the usual academic contexts, in Wales, the UK and Ireland. Offers of lectures will also be made to universities in the USA where I have previously lectured and have contacts (the universities of Stanford, Columbia and Berkeley ), and to the University of Austin, Texas, during my research trip there in February-March 2012).

It is also proposed to contact high-profile figures in the arts, media and public life who have previously expressed a marked appreciation of the work of Dylan Thomas and who might wish to either publicly endorse the edition, or participate in the events surrounding publication of the edition. This would be either be done directly by the editor, or via publishers, arts organisations and organisers of the Assembly-sponsored events. Those to be approached would include poets such as Geoffrey Hill, the musicians / composers John Cale and Robin Williamson, the painter Peter Blake, the actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, ex-US Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, etc.
 
Dylan Thomas: Complete Annotated Poems is to be published in lavish hardback and mass-market paperback format. David Higham, the agents for the Dylan Thomas estate, and Orion plc and New Directions Books have advised me that, as the new standard edition of the poems, the proposed edition is likely to sell well and to find a receptive international audience, and a guaranteed market in university and public libraries worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>67357</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk on the poetry of Dylan Thomas</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7716C0C4-A6BD-4D2E-9213-0E1FD648E691</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked discussion and questions afterwards

Lawrence, James Joyce and T.S. Eliot. He is, in other words, a central figure, not a marginal one, in the history of mid-twentieth century literature, and it will no longer be possible to treat him simply as a fluke or freak, as has been the case in critical accounts written since the since the 1970s. A conference organised at Cambridge University in October 2014, which publicly spelt out that it was based on my research, recognised this at the highest level; a collection of essays based on that book, edited by Dr Ned Allen of Jesus College for Edinburgh University Press, and due out in 2016, will encapsulate that in book form.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I hope researchers will now re-assess what happened in 1930s poetry, giving due emphasis to the biomorphic, apocalyptic strain established by Dylan Thomas, rather than over-emphasising the Audenesque, New Country strain. I also feel that, just as 1940s fiction has been reassessed in the last decade, so will 1940s poetry, with Thomas at its heart. This in turn has implications for the way we understand poetry today; the mainstream plain-style, derived from Auden and Larkin, may now have to share space with the linguistically innovative strain which descends from Thomas via W.S. Graham and others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31947147-BD38-4691-91E3-DF45A6D2A8FE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df105790e464.90179116</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4E290B01-AB77-4B7B-9E72-6F39560AA12B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dylan Thomas: A Centenary Celebration</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47e79feb82072f6bb6349a5b08ee2242"><gtr:id>47e79feb82072f6bb6349a5b08ee2242</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goodby, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4729-0309-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54635db9ba4180.02919439</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6E45D91-8F41-4FA2-A4A4-F4697524F2DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d39d64717b3ca0fdb7fc9ea093e9d1c5"><gtr:id>d39d64717b3ca0fdb7fc9ea093e9d1c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goodby, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-297-86569-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>546359ea565227.07092636</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J00815X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
