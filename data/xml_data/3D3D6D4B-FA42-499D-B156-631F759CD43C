The immune system consists of multiple layers of protection of progressively increasing complexity. 
(1) Simple barriers such as the skin that prevent access of harmful agents into the body.
(2) The &amp;quot;innate&amp;quot; immune response. This is a &amp;quot;hard-wired&amp;quot; response that is able to respond quickly but does so in a very simple and stereotyped manner.
(3) The &amp;quot;adaptive&amp;quot; immune response. This is a second-line of defence which is slower but cleverer. It targets individual threats specifically and is capable of generating memory to prevent future infections from the same foreign agent. 

The adaptive immune response is orchestrated by a group of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. B cells are one form of lymphocyte that circulate in the blood and produce antibodies specific to individual foreign agents. Antibodies bind to foreign material and target them for destruction. Antibody production is stimulated in response to activation of B cells when the receptor on their cell surface recognises its target. Antibodies are then produced that are specific for that particular target. Some B cells are long lasting and provide memory such as occurs after vaccination.

The process of foreign material binding to the B cell receptor activates the B cell and signals it to produce antibody. Many of the molecular mechanisms that underpin this activation of B cells are well established. However, what remains unclear is how the receptor binding to the target actually activates this set of signals. In this project we set out to investigate this so called &amp;quot;triggering&amp;quot; mechanism of B cells. 

An understanding of this area of science has significant potential implications since when it goes wrong it can lead to disease. An inappropriate triggering of B cells can lead to a situation in which the body attacks non-harmful targets. These targets could include normal body components. This process is analogous to &amp;quot;friendly-fire&amp;quot; and leads to autoimmune conditions such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythromatosis (SLE). In the converse scenario when the triggering mechanism fails to detect a foreign agent a threat is not eradicated and this can lead to worsening infection. 

In order to ascertain what goes wrong in these medical conditions we first need to establish the normal process. This is what our research is attempting to understand. Working together with my supervisors, Professor Richard Cornall and Professor Simon Davis, we will use a laboratory-based approach to establish how this triggering mechanism happens at the level of individual B cell receptors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>B cell activation is initiated in response to antigen binding to the B cell receptor (BCR). While much is known about the downstream signalling following B cell activation, what remains unresolved is how antigen binding to the extracellular domain triggers this signalling cascade. In this project we aim to gain a clearer understanding of the exact mechanism of BCR triggering. We have three key aims:

(1) To establish the oligomerisation state of the BCR in the resting, non-antigen bound state using Two Colour Co-incidence Detection (TCCD). 

(2) To establish whether there is any evidence to support the Kinetic Segregation (KS) model in BCR triggering. We plan to use hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) as our antigen and present it to HEL-reactive B cells in a planar lipid bilayer system. We will present antigen of varying lengths in order to test the idea that the size of the gap between membranes affects B cell triggering, through the physical exclusion of inhibitory phosphatases which we will label using fluorescent probes. 

(3) Finally, we will use the above methods to establish whether there are any differences in BCR triggering across different B cell subsets from anti-HEL specific transgenic mice. 

A thorough understanding of these early events in B cell activation is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the B cell immune response and what constitutes immunogenic and tolerogenic antigens. This work has significant potential clinical implications. Abnormal B cell activation can result in autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivity and lymphoid cancer. The ability to manipulate the triggering mechanism therefore has potential therapeutic implications for future drug design. Furthermore, full utilisation of the B cell response could be harnessed to optimise immunity induced by vaccination.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal into the basic mechanisms of B cell activation has potential impact in terms of: the advancement of scientific knowledge; vaccine development; drug discovery; patient care; inward investment in science; professional development; and public knowledge and the perception of research methods.

The potential beneficiaries of the research will include:
- Members of the general public.
- Individual patients and carers.
- Clinicians, doctors and healthcare workers.
- Biotechnology companies, spin-offs, commercial start-ups, and pharmaceutical companies.

These individuals are expected to benefit from our research through the following avenues:

THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE
This will help to inform the general public about immune function and genetic disease, and the scientific approach. The wider scientific community will also be a key beneficiary of this new knowledge.

VACCINE DEVELOPMENT
Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of B cell immune function will enable us to design better vaccines against the spread of infectious diseases, potentially affecting millions of people.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY
Identifying the biochemical pathways associated with B cell immune function may lead to suitable targets for the treatment of inflammatory disease, allergy or cancer, new drugs and commercial activity.

PATIENT CARE
The discovery of an underlying mechanism of B cell activation will be important in understanding both immunity and immune deficiency. It is possible the findings will extrapolate to a variety of common conditions, health policy and guidelines.

INWARD INVESTMENT IN SCIENCE
Since B cell activation and antigen presentation by B cells is fundamental to immunity and tolerance, the results of this project may have far wider implications and help to seed research investment in a variety of immunological and other disease pathways.

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING - CONTRIBUTING TO SKILLS
The project will provide professional training and skills transferrable to the public or commercial sector.
