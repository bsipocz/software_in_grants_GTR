The principal beneficiaries of this work will be the academic and research staff who engage in the activities funded through the grant, and also the target audiences in industry, government and the public arena. We anticipate that there will be 4 major benefits:

(i) a direct impact in the medium-term on the economic competitiveness of UK industry, and the creation of lasting partnerships with leading companies based overseas;
(ii) an increased awareness (and hence utilisation) of research results that may be brought to bear on the formulation of public policy or regulatory standards;
(iii) an improved understanding amongst our staff of the importance of articulating the outcomes of their research to both lay and professional audiences, to whom we will communicate directly (e.g. via Web 2.0 tools) and via the established media; 
(iv) a better awareness amongst the general public of emerging research results and associated societal issues, including ethical and governance issues. 

These benefits will be felt on different timescales, some more or less immediate (e.g. new or strengthened collaborations with industry or overseas partners), others in the longer term (e.g. through changes in public policy that have been informed by the outcomes of original research).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, the following groups will benefit directly:

1. the commercial private sector in the UK and overseas - we will utilise the funds for networking to support engagement of our staff with end users in industry, such that where appropriate, these end users are brought into the research process from beginning to end (assistance in the preparation of bids, direct engagement with the research itself, and the subsequent use/dissemination of research results and other outcomes). This will have a direct impact in the medium-term on the economic competitiveness of UK industry, and assist in creating lasting partnerships with companies based overseas;
 
2. policy-makers in government, government agencies and regulators - where appropriate, funds may be used to engage with these groups in order to ensure that they are aware of, and can utilise, research results that have a direct bearing on the formulation of public policy or regulatory standards. The long-term effect will be to improve the effectiveness of such policies and/or standards;

3. third sector - we propose to use some of the funds to engage a charitable body (The Royal Society or similiar) to provide media and communication skills training to our researchers. This will include engaging with both lay and professional audiences. The benefits ought to be immediate and long-lasting, given the media's appetite for good science stories with a 'human' element; 

4. the wider public - we anticipate that our researchers will make use of their media skills training (see [3] above) to present their work to a non-technical audience, such that the public is made aware of emerging research results and issues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>246092</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F5A41C9-CBB9-4BB8-BB20-EBEE8039094A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spectrum-compatible accelerograms with harmonic wavelets</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Structures</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a4efc9432bbead1127c4377edf7ac5e"><gtr:id>8a4efc9432bbead1127c4377edf7ac5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cecini D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675f5cd6c943</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J014400/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>82C70E72-2209-4A44-A192-A9AACE9E06C2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
