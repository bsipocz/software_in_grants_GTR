Labour markets are recognised as key institutional routes through which the benefits of growth are distributed across populations. Moreover, empirical research suggests that women?s access to labour market opportunities, particularly those which offer predictable incomes and ?decent? working conditions, can strengthen their voice and agency within the family and in the wider community. Yet, despite high rates of growth in recent decades, marked gender disparities in labour market outcomes persist across much of South Asia. These disparities are all the more puzzling in the context of Bangladesh. While it is one of the poorer countries in the region, it has not only shared in its high growth rates but has made more rapid progress in other aspects of gender equality, eg health and education. This project will combine different research methods in order to carry out a detailed investigation into the interactions between individual choice, cultural norms and economic structures which might explain persisting gender disparities in labour market outcomes in the Bangladesh context as well as how these interactions might vary for men and women from different social groups and geographical locations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Growing evidence suggests that women's employment acts as a structural catalyst for various forms of change, such as household poverty reduction and improvements in the education and well being of family members, that serve to make growth more inclusive. While this effect works largely through the impact of paid work on women's voice and agency, our earlier research in Bangladesh suggests that the effect is strongest and most consistent when women have access to better paid and regular work outside the home. Yet in Bangladesh, as in much of South Asia, women are largely absent from these forms of work. Our research sets out to explore the various factors that can help to expand and improve women's labour market options with a view to working closely with those who are in a position to act on the practical implications of the research. Because of important commonalites in the cultural norms that restrict women's labour force participation across South Asia, we believe that our findings will have a wider relevance. Our aim is to move beyond the general insights on women's labour market behaviour documented in the academic literature to a more detailed analysis of the interaction between individual choice and constraints of various kinds at both household level and in the wider institutional and political context. While some of these constraints are likely to be more intractable than others, addressing those that are amenable to public action may serve to undermine the more resilient constraints over time. 

The primary beneficiaries of our research will be those women in Bangladesh who would like to take up decent and productive employment, but are blocked by various constraints. In the longer run, it will be low-income households who will benefit since women's earning capacity is likely to contribute to poverty reduction. However, these benefits will depend very much on our capacity to engage with the various stakeholders who are in a position to act on our findings. We anticipate 3 constituencies for our research. 

First, there will be a range of national-level stakeholders likely to be interested in our findings from both development and women's empowerment perspectives. These will include employers' associations, trade unions, labour organisations, women's groups, legal rights activists, local government officials, non-government organisations involved in promoting women's paid work and skills development, and local representatives of the international donor community, particularly ILO, DFID, the World Bank and UN Women. We will set up a small Reference Group drawn from this constituency at the outset to work with us throughout the project. We will work with the Group to engage with the wider constituency of national stakeholders through an inception workshop to be held in Dhaka within three months of starting the project. The aim will be to share our research objectives and seek advice on key questions that the research should address. We will also organise a workshop at the final stages to disseminate our findings and explore its practical implications for different groups of stakeholders. 

Internationally, we would seek to engage with organisations that are interested in, or would benefit from, the policy implications of our findings: the ILO, WIEGO, SEWA, the World Bank, UN Women, DFID and other bilateral donors that have placed women's economic empowerment high on their agenda. A small Reference Group will be constituted from this group in order to provide advice and assist us in our efforts to disseminate relevant findings and recommendations. 

Finally, we will seek to expand and strengthen the public constituency for women's economic empowerment in Bangladesh by using our media strategy to engage students and the general public in a wider debate to challenge cultural preconceptions about women's work and the widespread belief that their absence from the labour market is purely a matter of choice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>454378</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Free University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Business and Economics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Lead firm, supplier and institutional responses to the Rana Plaza disaster</gtr:description><gtr:id>608808E1-BEFE-4310-A935-6C69F8AF5A4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet started.

A number of important findings have emerged. 
First of all, we find that using exactly the same definition of extended labour force participation as used in the official Labour Force Survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), which is in turn based on the internationally-accepted ILO definition, gives us considerably higher rate of female labour force activity than that reported by the BBS. The main reason for the divergence lies in the higher rates of home-based economic activity, both paid and unpaid, that our survey captures compared to those estimated by the BBS. Discussions with BBS staff allowed us to ascertain the main reasons for the discrepancy. These include the tendency on the part of BBS officials to 'adapt' the ILO questions to perceived local reality, the kind of training provided to survey enumerators, the number of respondents covered per enumerator and the source of information on women's work provided to enumerators: we asked women themselves while the BBS enumerators spoke to the household head who clearly under-reported women's home-based activity. The puzzle that motivated our research was that, despite the transformative potential associated with paid work, particularly paid work outside the home, official statistics suggested not only very low rates of female labour force participation (36% in 2010), but also a high concentration of working women in unpaid family labour (56%). Our survey findings suggest that, in fact, 78% of women were in the labour force, of whom 23% were in unpaid work, 56% were in paid work within the home and 16% were in paid work outside the home. While our sample is clearly not nationally representative, it does suggest that official statistics are failing to capture the real figures on women's work. 

Secondly, the more inclusive estimates of female labour force participation provided by our survey meant that the usual determinants of female labour force participation reported in the Bangladesh literature (such as education, household wealth, marital status) did not prove significant in our analysis. Instead, these variables were much more significant in predicting the kind of labour market activity that women were engaged in, distinguishing between home-based and work outside the home, between waged employment and self- employment. We were particularly interested in women working outside the home since this represents a break with the norm of female seclusion in Bangladesh and was, according to our earlier analysis, more likely to be associated with a change in women's position within the household and community. 

Our findings suggested that, as in the past, divorced, separated and widowed women and women from the lowest wealth terciles were more likely to work in casual waged work outside the home. This reflects their poverty and the absence of a primary male breadwinner and as such can be seen as a 'distress sale' of labour with limited transformative potential. The influence of cultural norms is evident in the fact that women who expressed support for traditional ideas about women's gender roles were also more likely to work in the home. and secondly, religion per se did not appear to differentiate women's participation rates, controlling for other factors, women who wore burkah/hijab and hence could be considered more religious, were more likely to work from home. 

Where change was evident was in the significant percentage of young, single women, particularly those with post-secondary education, who had taken up work outside the home. These women were more likely to be working in response to economic opportunity rather than economic distress since most of them are to be found in formal/semi-formal waged work (export-oriented factory labour, NGOs and community-based services generated by government and NGOs). In addition, 'connectivity' of various kinds, such as ownership of a mobile phone and household electricity, along with female migration, were also associated with paid work outside the home, again suggesting a response to opportunity rather than the pressure of poverty. 

While most married women, particularly those with primary responsibility for care and domestic chores, worked within the home, we noted that most engaged in what the ILO would classify as own-account activity rather than unpaid family labour or subsistence work. The main reason behind this appeared to be the spread of microfinance. These women were associated with microfinance organizations, had taken loans from these organizations and were engaged in livestock and poultry rearing, a common use of microfinance loans. 

We further explored what our survey data could tell us about what motivated so many women to opt for work within the home. The fact that the primary reason that women gave for preferring certain jobs was that it could be carried out within the home suggested an active desire on their part to conform to cultural norms of female seclusion. This interpretation had to be partly modified when taking into account the reasons that they gave for their aversion to jobs that took them outside the home. Here the main emphasis was on disapproval they faced from their community for their departure from cultural norms as well as the nature of the limited wage labour opportunities available to less educated women (daily agricultural wage labour and domestic service). In other words, rather than an active compliance with purdah norms, women's concentration in home-based work also reflected a response to the external pressure exercised by the community and the difficult and demeaning nature of wage opportunities that characterised the female segment of the labour market. To this has to be added the greater likelihood of harrassment at the workplace as well as adverse health effects reported by women in outside work. 

March 2017: we have now started to analyse survey data on a subset of 2000 male heads of households drawn from the female survey. Preliminary analysis suggests that while male labour force participation appears to be responsive to standard economic variables, such as education, age, household wealth and so on, status considerations also played a role in their decisions in that most men expressed a desire to work for themselves rather than for others. We are exploring in greater detail the extent to which status norms, both about their own work and work undertaken by women in their households, affects male labour market behaviour. 
We are also now analysing the qualitative interviews with the women in our sample. This is revealing a number of factors which are not taken into account in conventional explanations of labour market behaviour. In particular, it tells us how ideas about women's bodies and sexuality play a powerful role in restricting their labour market choices and in shaping their behaviour when they move outside the home. Questions of safety appeared less important in restricting women's movements than concerns about what 'people might say'. We are also exploring the extent to which the clearly documented rise in women wearing hijab/burkah reflects a desire to move more freely in the public domain or a signal about their desire to comply with purdah norns.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>On the basis of our findings with regard to the discrepancy in estimates of women's labour force participation rates between the official Labour Force Survey of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and our own survey, the senior researcher in Bangladesh has acted in an advisory capacity to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 

As noted earlier in our earlier report on the project, the Bangladesh team has been been working on the determinants of female labour force participation using national-level Labour Force Survey data for 2006-2010. The analysis is now complete. Not only does it help to locate our survey findings in the broader national context, but we also plan to share the more detailed account of these determinants emerging from our data with the Bureau of Statistics and with the Labour Ministry. 

I was invited to participate in an international conference in Dhaka being organised by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Association to discuss the industry's responses to Rana Plaza. As a result of links made through our meetings with the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Association and other key stakeholders in the Bangladesh garment industry, my co-investigator and I are now involved in a multi-country research project (funded by Volkswagen Foundation) investigating the impact of the Accord/Alliance agreement with between global buyers and Bangladeshi manufacturers which starts at the beginning of 2016. We will be drawing on the qualitative research we will be carrying out as part of the ES/L0054841/1 award to supplement some of the findings of that project which does not have a qualitative component on workers' views. 

We have presented preliminary findings to the Gender and Jobs sections of the World Bank (we were invited by Dr. Lucia Hanmer who is on our advisory group) and at the Economic Research Forum in the Middle East. There was considerable interest in both forums in the labour market impact of cultural norms which are similar across South Asia and the MENA region.. 
March 2017: The Open Society Foundations Economic Advancement Program has consulted with me on their proposal to address 'social norms' as a part of their portfolio of work. Our research will have a great deal to say about how social norms constrain women's labour market behaviour in regions with some of the lowest rates of female labour force participation in the world (South Asia and MENA), The findings from our project have also informed the questionnaire and methodology we have adopted in our research in West Bengal under ESRC/DFID funding so that there will be a strong basis for comparative work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BEB53B51-E10D-42B8-B3C9-9ADE53A31AA2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546d6742962392.15701716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E90A6584-0B02-496D-BE00-002069303BC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Disentangling choice and constraint in women's labour force participation in Bangladesh: what does the literature tell us?'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f9c78e487de4c6b82d3996f34361d659"><gtr:id>f9c78e487de4c6b82d3996f34361d659</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kabeer, N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546d4fb3688067.11386745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02A4B032-9BE5-46C4-9C3B-CD4F0B5129A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Report on stakeholder workshop on Gender dynamics in the labour market in Bangladesh: a puzzle and a challenge</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c9a15c3796a63de1bb54f5e2bfb835dc"><gtr:id>c9a15c3796a63de1bb54f5e2bfb835dc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Huq, Lopita</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546f1b3db683e5.43224182</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F001F140-9671-467A-B5A5-0C8A3E8C21E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Norm, Economic Incentives and Women's Labour Market Behaviour: Empirical Insights From Bangladesh</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oxford Development Studies (revised resubmission under review)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a0c60c65f56e611a352ab8a9f18cbba1"><gtr:id>a0c60c65f56e611a352ab8a9f18cbba1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Heintz, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dea537d4fc06.24867371</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>64D7E585-3030-47D3-9E12-2DD6D257D267</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural Change and Dynamics of Labour Markets in Bangladesh:Studies on Labour and Employment</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/43e2d23b42958f348aa14071d5725da2"><gtr:id>43e2d23b42958f348aa14071d5725da2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>S.
