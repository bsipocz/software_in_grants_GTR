driverless cars and Alpha Go's recent defeat of
the 9-dan ranked South Korean Go player Lee Se-dol have considerably
increased public awareness of the potential for computers to achieve
human-level competence in settings which were previously the exclusive
realm of human judgement and skill. However, in human terms
statistical AI techniques still act as skilled zombies, having
unconscious skills detached from the ability to express goals or intentions.
The lack of ability to communicate in a co-operative fashion with
human beings limits the long-term potential of these approaches
in many commercially and socially valuable settings.

The workshop will address issues related to interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills
can be studied and modelled computationally. While many of these issues have
been prominent for some time in symbolic AI, we are yet
to see successful integration of statistical and symbolic AI approaches
which achieves the broad range of phenomena present in human behaviour.
This workshop aims to contribute to the objectives of the EPSRC's Human-Like
Computing priority area by crystalising the key issues which need to
be prioritised in this area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It became clear from discussions at the EPSRC Bristol workshop on Human-Like Computing that
different communities of researchers were out of touch with latest
research and trends within areas far from their own. This led
to the suggestion of the value in holding an inter-disciplinary
workshop in which leading experts in these fields provided overviews
and descriptions of latest research findings to those from other
fields. It was agreed that the format and UK tradition of the Machine
Intelligence series would provide an ideal forum for holding such a workshop,
and that the EPSRC should be approached for funding.
As a consequence the proposed workshop will
have the theme of ``Human-Like Computing''. It was further agreed that
invited papers from the workshop will be published in a special
issue of the journal Topics in Cognitive Science. Ulrike Hahn,
a member of the editorial board of the journal, has been tasked with
organising this special issue.

For the limited cost such a workshop is expected to have considerable
long-term impact in helping form a community of researchers working on some
of the hardest unsolved problems in bot Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive
Science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33751</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nanjing University (NJU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nanjing-Imperial Machine Learning Centre</gtr:description><gtr:id>486CCA41-DE82-4C9C-87F1-67DE35D0CB7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>W-Z Dai, S.H.

Human-Like Computing (HLC) research aims to endow machines with human-like perceptual, reasoning and learning abilities which support collaboration and communication with human beings. Such abilities should support computers in interpreting the aims and intentions of humans based on learning and accumulated background knowledge to help identify contexts and cues from human behaviour. Techniques of this kind are required in applications in which close interactions are required between computers and human users. The workshop brought together leading experts in AI and Psychology to investigate areas of fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills can be studied and modelled computationally. While many of these issues have been prominent for some time in symbolic AI, we are yet to see successful integration of statistical and symbolic AI approaches which achieves the broad range of phenomena present in human behaviour. The workshop helped identifying the objectives of the EPSRC's HLC area by crystalising the key research issues to be prioritised in this area.

In particular, it was agreed at the meeting that the following eight topics were of particular common interest for ongoing interactions between the AI and Psychology communities.

 1. Representation Change - implementation, role and psychology
 of creativity
 2. High to low-level learning - bridging the gap
 3. Value of forgetting in people and AI systems
 4. Comprehensibility, language, meaning and learning, explanation,
 accountability
 5. Verbal versus non-verbal communication
 6. Small data learning- AI challenge and connection to cognition
 7. Social Robotics - theory of minds - Self Perception - Context cues
 Spatial reasoning
 8. Automated programming - psychology and application
