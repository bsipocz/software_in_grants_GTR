Reference is the process of making sure that a user/receiver can identify an entity - for example a person, thing, place, or event. Reference can be accomplished through language, but also through for example pointing, gaze, highlighting, and combinatons of the above. Reference can be considered the &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; of communication, and as such it is crucial for practical applications, from robotics and gaming to embodied agents, satellite navigation, and multimodal interfaces. 

RefNet will foster collaboration between researchers in Computing Science and researchers in Psycholinguistics, and between researchers and practitioners in industry and the public sector. Through the study of reference, RefNet will build a wider interdisciplinary skills base for research on communication that will be of crucial importance at a time when computing science is becoming closely interlinked with other disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>44415</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RefNet Round Table: Beyond Reference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CEF2AD43-3303-4C4E-BB96-645E05FFDCF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The core of this event was a symposium to which 13 invited key researchers, from all over the world, and from both computer science and the social sciences, came to Aberdeen to discuss the emergence of predictive models of comprehension and production, and the increasing use of neuro-scientific methods. These two topics have great relevance for reference (which is the main focus of the project). They were chosen as the themes of the Round Table event because they have much wider significance across the cognitive sciences, and because they are topical. Additionally, we accepted a number of posters (following an open call) detailing recent research that sheds light on these themes; these posters were visible throughout the event and discussed during a special session. The event concluded with a 2.5-hour discussion about future cross-disciplinary research projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc89ca1ad677.81354993</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.matt.qa/refnet/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Production of Referring Expressions: bridging the gap between cognitive and computational approaches to reference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3F4421C-FFF1-4814-8722-770866F6DDBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event, which took place on 31 July 2013 in Berlin, built on two earlier workshops on reference to link computational work on reference with work on the same topic by other cognitive scientists.

Linguistic, philosophical, psychological and computational approaches to linguistic reference - particularly to the production and processing of referring expressions - were represented. From 90+ applicants from around the world, we selected 45 who were active young researchers, who were endorsed by their research supervisors, and who represented all the disciplines of interest. The goals were not only sharing research skills, but also building a cross-disciplinary community of researchers.

Given the enthusiasm with which supervisors had endorsed their students' participation, and the focus and commitment of the students, we expect that the students themselves will be spreading expertise in their own institutions. We have already had requests for an annual summer school and for a related activity - sponsored lab visits.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463830322a691.98986875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/RefNet/events.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RefNet Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F807AAF0-0ECE-48A0-A992-0DF59413113D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In accordance with the proposal for this Research Network Grant, we worked with colleagues at Strathclyde and Herot-Watt Universities to organize a one-day workshop which followed the RefNet Summer School. Summer School participants and established researchers, including members of our boards, presented papers on acquisition, production, comprehension, and modelling of referring expressions in natural language.

Aside from the usual academic sequels of conference talks, this workshop helped to develop a forum for where researchers can influence colleagues in other disciplines.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546385943ca016.13868639</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/refnet/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The training and network activities have fueled the development of interdisciplinary research as previously described.

The appropriate use of referring expressions is key to automatic generation of text from data, to the creation of clear public information, and to the introduction of new concepts in teaching. It is more difficult to read texts which employ referring expressions specified at the wrong level of detail for their context and audience. They literally misdirect the reader. In any area where the public confront official, educational, expository, or legal information, the appropriate referring expressions are important tools.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>602BD83D-0ADE-47CA-9DB1-E4BC8D6C59BD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc92e7967fb7.58429767</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/RefNet/?_ga=1.206112026.800835892.148961568</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>MapTaskAix is a partial replication in French of the HCRC MapTask Corpus Design. Two speakers attempt to replicate on the Instruction Follower's map a route pre-printed on the Instruction Giver's map. The routes circumnavigate cartoon landmarks which are sporadically inconsistent between Giver and Follower maps. Interlocutors know that but not where inconsistencies will occur. The names of the landmarks are designed to explore referential and phonological preferences in each language. Map Task corpora now exist for several varieties of English, for Italian, German, Catalan, Japanese, Swedish, etc. By providing speakers with a goal-critical need to identify a limited set of objects, the technique permits exploration of discourse, lexical, phonological, and sociolinguistic aspects of establishing and using referring expressions.
The corpus exists in audio, transcription, and some video files.</gtr:description><gtr:id>76B72611-2310-45F0-A939-84407F48BA7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The corpus has been downloaded multiple times and has generated publications within the ANR (France) CoFee (Conversational Feedback) project.
