The role of working conditions &amp;amp; job availability in incapacity claims, &amp;amp; whether these should be part of incapacity assessment</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K009583/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Over a million older people claim incapacity benefits in Britain, on the grounds that their health or disability stops them from working - four times as many as those claiming unemployment benefits, despite the downturn. But what does it actually mean to say that someone is 'incapacitated'?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Take two people with identical impairments: a London-based graduate and an unskilled person in Merthyr Tydfil. The graduate may have better working conditions, an employer who is more willing to change the job to fit them, or be able to find another job that their health permits them to do. The unskilled worker may have none of these options, particularly if they are older and therefore more likely to have lower qualifications, to be biologically 'slowing down', and to face age-related discrimination.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is these ?non-medical factors? that are the focus of this project. The research firstly involves a statistical analysis of working conditions, adjustments and the availability of work in the UK and Europe. It then looks at whether the public and elites think that non-medical factors should be taken into account in assessing incapacity, using both a new survey and a series of workshops with different groups.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Incapacity benefits themselves have multiple impacts on society: they are a major public expense, they help protect all of us from the income risk of losing our job through ill-health, and they are a central pillar of what is considered a fair and decent society. Yet currently in Britain (and elsewhere) they are heavily contested, particularly around the boundary of who is 'really' incapacitated. In this context, four groups will benefit from this research.

1. POLICYMAKERS
Policymakers will benefit from (i) understanding the role of non-medical factors in incapacity and how this contributes to inequalities in incapacity, and (ii) how far elites and the public consider these non-medical factors when assessing incapacity. This will help UK policymakers (i) design a better-functioning system of incapacity assessment (following on from official reviews in 2013 &amp;amp; 2014); and (ii) ensure that provision for disabled people in the new Universal Credit system (being rolled out 2013-2018) is efficient and fair - with analogous impacts in similar debates internationally(e.g. prompted by the OECD). It will also suggest broader policy areas and specific targeting of subgroups that could reduce the social and economic cost of incapacity claims (e.g. job matching for low-skilled disabled people in areas of low labour demand), and address issues about whether old workers will be 'fit for work' if state pension ages continue to be raised internationally.

2. PRACTITIONERS
Another impact will be on a diverse group of practitioners, including those involved in occupational health within employers, GPs, benefit incapacity assessors (Atos Healthcare), Jobcentre Plus staff, Prime Contractors, and other staff within the welfare-to-work arena. The project will lead to immediate lessons for practice in understanding how non-medical factors make it harder for their clients to return-to-work, and which factors may help overcome this. This will contribute to more accurate assessment, better support for clients, better employment-related outcomes, and (in the long-term) better contracts with Government with incentives that reflect the real barriers clients face.

3. LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH PROVIDERS
Incapacity claims are highly concentrated in certain areas. This spatial analysis in this project will (i) given local authorities and GPs (taking over responsibility from Primary Care Trusts) a better understanding of incapacity in their specific area, helping them negotiate for appropriate settlements with central government and design appropriate local policy responses; and (ii) consider the acceptability among stakeholders of bringing regional factors into the assessment of incapacity, mirroring debates on regional variations in public sector pay.

4. DISABLED PEOPLE, OLDER PEOPLE and THE WIDER PUBLIC
Finally, the project will have an impact on the lives of disabled people and older people in three ways. Firstly, a better understanding of the nature of incapacity will contribute to a better system of incapacity assessment, not only providing support where it is intended but without the high levels of appeals and anxiety of the current system. Secondly, a clear idea of what incapacity is - linked to evidence on what the public think it SHOULD be - could remove some of the lack of legitimacy in the current system, thereby reducing some of the stigma of claiming (Baumberg et al, In Press). Finally, public debate about incapacity benefits is based on the misconception that incapacity is about whether people are 'completely incapable of work', and how many older people this applies to. The project's evidence on non-medical influences will contribute to a better quality of debate on a key welfare state issue - itself a positive impact on wider society.

I do not yet have audience data (though I will have this in future), but it seems that it reached a reasonable audience (see below).

The activity was viewed positively, and resulted in one offer of future research collaboration:
[(i) A prominent disability advocate contacted me, with her email reading, &amp;quot;Just read your article in Demos Quarterly. Excellent. Congratulations.&amp;quot; (ii) A representative from the Strategy, Equality and Performance team within the London Borough of Islington contacted me, with his email beginning &amp;quot;Have just read your piece in the DEMOS Quarterly with interest&amp;quot;, and offering the possibility of doing future work in Islington]

- EVIDENCE: I was the lead author on a Demos (think tank) report that reviewed incapacity assessment in other countries. Two academic papers developing this work have just been submitted, and while drafts of these reports have been circulated, in general the evidence has been communicated through presentations, meetings and one-to-one discussions. The main findings are (i) models for reforming the Work Capability Assessment, the benefits disability test, and (ii) that conditionality for disabled benefit claimants is likely to be counterproductive.

- GOVERNMENT: after presenting my Demos report findings at a Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) internal seminar in May 2015, I was brought in on secondment as an Expert Advisor in the DWP's ESA and WCA Policy Division from late 2015 until mid 2016. I was involved in many discussions about the Green Paper (published Dec 2016), and have continued to speak to the civil servants concerned about assessment &amp;amp; conditionality.

- PARLIAMENT: I was invited to give oral evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee inquiry into the disability employment gap in 2016 (and was cited several times in the report with reference to conditionality), and was invited to present to the backbench social security interest group of the Parliamentary Labour Party. I also met with the Shadow Ministerial team in the last Researchfish submission period. 

- THINK TANKS: aside from my formal partnership with Demos for this project, I have fed these conclusions into many think tank reports - for example, being invited to speak alongside the Minister for Disabled People at the launch of a Resolution Foundation report in 2016, or being a member of the advisory group for the Centre for Social Justice disability report to be released March 2017. In both cases, the language around conditionality was amended as a direct result of my interventions to highlight the evidence on its counterproductive effects.

- DISABILITY CHARITIES &amp;amp; DISABLED PEOPLE'S ORGANISATIONS: I have had countless conversations with disability charities and disabled people's organisations, sometimes directly communicating my evidence findings and sometimes indirectly feeding evidence into their work through meetings and comments on their work. For example, I spoke to Mencap at length about their response to the 2016 Green Paper, held a workshop with the Disability Benefits Consortium, and helped the grassroots disability group Spartacus by commenting on their own draft report in response to the Green Paper.

Overall, my project blog has had 33,000 unique users and almost 50,000 page views.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3EC166AC-3A2E-458F-B486-5520DFF8367C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54413eeebea1f5.07699224</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings to date are those of the Demos report from March 2015 (other work is either within-Government and confidential, or only partially complete).

Lesson 1 Real-world assessment is possible - and even commonplace

Lesson 2 A standardised real-world assessment is possible

Lesson 3 We can separate real-world incapacity from unemployment

Lesson 4 Unemployment benefits must also be a 'safe place' for disabled people

Lesson 5 It is hard to evaluate the success of incapacity assessments from other countries
