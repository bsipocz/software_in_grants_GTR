Such repeated references often use different linguistic expressions &amp;quot;the person in the butcher's shop&amp;quot; followed by &amp;quot;the man&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, for example. These changes seem natural, but they need a scientific explanation. One account, developed on a previous ESRC project. is called JANUS, because it claims that readers must take account of both what has already been said and of what might be said in the upcoming text. Linking back is primarily sorting out repeated reference. Linking forward is less well studied, but includes anticipating changes in perspective. JANUS claims that anticipating a change in perspective calls for more specific expressions. For example if the person in the butchers is referred to as &amp;quot;the footballer&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, the text is probably going to switch to their sporting activities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By measuring reading times for parts of texts, the project tests some specific predictions of JANUS, which contrast with other models.

Ethics approval has been obtained&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research addresses one of the most basic questions about text and discourse comprehension (and the production of comprehensible discourse). How are links made between very different expressions referring to the same person or thing (e.g. &amp;quot;the London Eye&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;) and what factors make these links easy or difficult to discern for the listener or reader. It aims to test a theory of the processes underlying the making of these links, based on a small number of general psychological principles. The most immediate impacts of the research will, inevitably, be on academic researchers carrying out similar research. However, the research has broader implications within psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology more generally. A proper theory of coreference processing has implications, for example, for developmental theories of how discourse comprehension develops, and provides a framework for describing the different skills that children have at different ages, as their comprehension abilities develop. Such a theory also has implications for what goes wrong in comprehension for people with various types of brain damage or degenerative diseases. For example, Amit Almor, author of one of the rival theories to JANUS (the ILH or informational load hypothesis) has applied his ideas to the breakdown of comprehension seem in patients with advance Alzheimer-type dementia.

Work on coreference processing can also have implication for linguistic analyses. Peter Gordon, author of another rival theory (derived from Centering Theory, as developed in computational linguistics) has used his work with Randall Hendrick to question an account of coreference based on Chomsky's theory of Government and Binding.

Casting a wider net, comprehensible text is increasingly important in everyday life, as more and more interpersonal communication is replaced by computer-based communication. Given that people have to understand information presented via computers with no help or with further computer-based help, it is important that the &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; of the material presented via computer-based system takes account of the way that people typically process text. For example, our JANUS model predicts that expressions that appear to be more specific than they need to be serve specific functions, such as emphasis or change of perspective. If no change of perspective is intended, an overspecific expression may be misleading. The results of our research will be of use to people who design text for the internet.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78209</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project was designed to investigate a core problem in text comprehension and design: what makes second and later references to a person or thing in a text easy or difficult to understand. In particular the project was designed to test predictions from a theoretical account of these processes (JANUS) developed in an earlier ESRC grant (R000239362).

We expected the immediate impacts of this research to be in the academic community, specifically among researchers in the field of the Psychology of Language. To this end, we presented the findings at one of the two leading international Psychology of Language Conferences, AMLaP (Architectures and Mechanisms of Language Processing - 2013 Conference, Marseille). The poster was presented by the Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Ian Finlayson. It generated some interest at the conference, both in the formal presentation and in informal conversations. Our work in this domain is widely known in the relevant academic community and continues to inform both my own current work (particularly in one PhD project) and work of other researchers in psycholinguistics.

Unfortunately, the results presented in the poster and those from the remaining part of the project did not provide clear support for our account (JANUS). Nor did they have obvious implications for other accounts. Ian Finlayson has worked on other, unrelated, projects since the grant ended, and so we have not, to date, prepared the results for publication. If and when we do so, we will target an academic journal aimed at psycholinguists and we will expect any immediate impact to be in this domain.

As discussed on the Key Findings page, there are a number of domains in which our findings might be used: rehabilitation, design of forms, design of computer-based systems that interact via text or conversation, theories of language development, linguistic theories of anaphora. With reference to the current project, we will need to develop a clear account of the results obtained, before their specific potential impacts can be assessed.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>09FBBBEF-A829-4815-AD9F-A5E92D33B155</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545233477cb447.39055155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In any text or conversations the same thing may be mentioned several times. Our theory, JANUS, is a theory about what form the second or later reference should take, in light of the way the person or thing was first described, and why some ways of making those later references are easier to understand than others. As an example, a person called John might later be referred to as &amp;quot;he&amp;quot;, but if two males are being talked about, &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; could be ambiguous, and it might be necessary to repeat the name John.

Our project tested three predictions made by JANUS.

The first prediction relates to potential problems caused by expressions being overspecific (repeating John, for example, when only one man is under discussion).

While there was evidence from two experiments that readers experience difficulty when a repeated name is used to refer to a salient character, neither experiment showed evidence that overspecificity of an anaphor can pose problems for readers (compared with the case when &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; is needed to avoid ambiguity). 

The second prediction relates to the fact that texts and conversations typically develop in a certain way, with characters at the focus of attention being discussed further. However, at some point attention shifts to someone else. When a shift occurs, it is necessary to work out that the current referring expression does not refer to the (previously) focused person (or thing). So, properties of that person should affect processing.

Specifically, if readers encounter a gendered pronoun (e.g. &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;she&amp;quot;) then they will expect the gender of the antecedent to match the gender of the pronoun. Following a shift, if the focused character does not match then readers should experience a cost while they search for an alternative. However, if they do match then there will be no cost as readers will wrongly assume that no shift has taken place. Contrary to this prediction, our experiment found that when a shift took place (i.e. when an antecedent was unfocused) participants experienced difficulty when characters did share a gender. 

The third prediction is that the form of an expression used to refer to a person may, in addition to ensuring a clear reference to that person in context, signal that a change of perspective on that person is about to take place. Overspecificity, for example, which might prove initially problematic (prediction 1 above) may later turn out to be justified as it signals a change of perspective (e.g from the home life to the professional life of a person).

Contrary to this prediction, we found no evidence of the expected pattern of results - initial difficulty with overspecificity, but a later advantage in the change of perspective condition following an overspecific reference. Rather, our results showed that although the overspecific anaphors did cause problems, at a later point a change of perspective caused difficulties, regardless of the form of the referring expression.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A proper understanding of the problems that people have with language comprehension is crucial to developing effective treatment or rehabilitation plans for those people. Such work must be carried out by those who have a sound grasp of the aetiology and symptomology of the patients, and skills in how to interact with them.

The use of principles from the study of discourse processes to the design of information for computer-based systems is another area in which our findings could prove useful. Again, such work is best carried out by people who design the computer systems, as the relevant considerations about discourse processing have to be integrated with a wide range of other factors that influence web design. The project is one of basic research on a fundamental question about text and discourse comprehension (and the production of comprehensible discourse). How are links made between different expressions referring to the same person or thing (e.g. &amp;quot;the London Eye&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;) and what factors make these links easy or difficult to discern for the listener or reader? The most immediate impacts of the research will be academic, and will be achieved via conference presentations and publications in academic journals. As well as having a direct impact within psycholinguistics, we anticipate that a proper theory of coreference processing will have implications, for example, for developmental theories of discourse comprehension. Such a theory also has implications for the comprehension problems seen in people with brain damage or degenerative diseases. Beyond psychology, work on coreference also has implication for linguistic analyses, as illustrate by the work of Peter Gordon and Randall Hendrick.

More broadly, comprehensible text is increasingly important in everyday life, as more and more interpersonal communication is replaced by computer-based communication. Given that people have to understand information presented via computers with no help or with further computer-based help, it is important that the &amp;quot;design&amp;quot;; of the material presented via computer-based system takes account of the way that people typically process text. For example, our JANUS model predicts that expressions that are more specific than they need to be for specifying what is referred to serve specific functions, such as emphasis or change of perspective. If no change of perspective is intended, an overspecific expression may be misleading. The availabilty of our results in the academic literature will enable people who design text for the internet to take the appropriate psychological findings into account.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B04A0299-79BC-454D-81E5-9CC5D0F961B6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8450843559.99794177712caa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2297F068-C51D-4F07-8B7B-AB45F33AFA99</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nouvelles perspectives sur l'anaphore : Points de vue linguistique, psycholinguistique et acquisitionnel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3cb33cb5c6022b27f01e084b1b7e221f"><gtr:id>3cb33cb5c6022b27f01e084b1b7e221f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garnham A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9783034315456</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b55f13cb5ef1.61836677</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C2EC35F-77B0-4084-A588-F231DF5522BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Testing the JANUS model: The role of focus in noun phrase anaphor resolution</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>19th Annual Conference on Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing (AMLaP-2013),</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1275ce57901e5ec876a2f9e896de1761"><gtr:id>1275ce57901e5ec876a2f9e896de1761</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Ian Finlayson (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_377264843713c651fc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J003360/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
