Unfortunately, their use is limited by side effects, which can be both distressing and harmful, with patients taking glucocorticoids reporting weight gain, diabetes, bone-thinning, insomnia, and altered fat distribution, amongst other problems. Minimising the side effects of glucocorticoids, whilst preserving their anti-inflammatory action, is key to improving the use of these accessible, cheap, and easy-to-administer drugs.

My host laboratory has just discovered that the action of glucocorticoid drugs is profoundly regulated by the body's intrinsic circadian clock. Our body clock, programmed by external signals such as light and food, is critical in maintaining the body's internal environment in the face of changing outside light, temperature and food availability. 

Work from our laboratory shows that the glucocorticoid receptor binds to sites in the genome which are closely related to binding sites for the core clock proteins, Cryptochrome (Cry), and REV-ERB. This suggests a novel mechanism operating to control glucocorticoid receptor action, involving priming, or preventing access of the glucocorticoid receptor to its target sites. Such a mechanism opens a therapeutic opportunity whereby the adverse effects of glucocorticoids could be targeted, without reducing their beneficial effects.

In my Fellowship, I plan to investigate whether Cry can indeed be exploited to reduce glucocorticoid side effects. I also plan to investigate the contribution of another protein, Metadherin. Metadherin (MTDH) has just been revealed as a regulator of glucocorticoid receptor binding to DNA, and fascinatingly, MTDH expression in the liver lies under circadian control. My host lab has obtained MTDH knockout mice, and in early work, these show a marked in-vivo glucocorticoid phenotype. I will now investigate the circadian dimension, using these mice.

My hypothesis is that the clock acts through Cryptochrome, and Metadherin, to regulate glucocorticoid action. I propose to test this using mice lacking Cry, or MTDH, and measure responses to acute and chronic glucocorticoid administration. I plan to determine whether or not Cryptochrome and Metadherin work together, and to use this information to test therapeutic strategies with the aim of reducing glucocorticoid side effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>My host laboratory has recently discovered that the circadian clock regulates glucocorticoid action in the liver. Two candidate mechanisms have emerged, one involving a core clock protein, Cryptochrome (Cry), and the other a clock-controlled gene, Metadherin (MTDH). Both Cryptochrome and Metadherin interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and exert complex effects on GR biology. I will determine how these two candidates convey timing information to GR using mice lacking the two Cryptochromes (Cry1, Cry2), and mice lacking Metadherin. I will then investigate whether my findings are therapeutically tractable, in order to reduce the hyperglycaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hepatosteatosis associated with glucocorticoid medication.

In the initial experiments, I will examine acute effects of glucocorticoid on liver gene expression, by time of day, in Cry1/2 double knockout mice, in order to determine whether rhythmic repression of glucocorticoid transactivation effects, by Cry, contributes to circadian regulation of glucocorticoid action. I will test whether pharmacological augmentation of Cry can reduce glucocorticoid transactivation effects.

I will then investigate GR regulation by MTDH by measuring the acute effects of glucocorticoid on liver gene expression and carbohydrate metabolism, by time of day, in MTDH knockout mice, compared to controls. The underlying mechanism will be defined by profiling gene expression globally using RNA-seq, and effects on GR function determined by ChIP-seq for the receptor in liver. I will investigate the convergence of pathways by measuring MTDH expression in Cry1/2 null mice, and by comparing my RNA-seq and GR ChIP-seq data with existing datasets, including Cry ChIP-seq, from wild-type liver.

Finally, I will examine whether these candidate mechanisms can be targeted to ameliorate the effects of chronic glucocorticoid exposure, specifically the effects on glucose metabolism, triglyceride levels, and hepatosteatosis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO?

- Academic researchers in endocrinology, chronobiology and metabolism.

- Biomedical researchers interested in the role of the cellular clock in regulating glucocorticoid effects.

- The UK-based pharmaceutical industry, by identifying novel potential targets for optimising glucocorticoid therapy, particularly given the enhanced links with a leading UK academic institution with a track record of successful translational research.

- The general public.

HOW?

The wider scientific community will benefit from the insights provided by this research into how the important functional interface lying between glucocorticoid hormones and glucose and lipid metabolism is regulated by cellular timing circuits. This research is cross-disciplinary, and benefits from specific input of expertise in nuclear hormone receptors, cell biology, and molecular biology, as well as chronobiology, pharmacology, and drug development. It is at the scientific cross-roads between disciplines that major advances are most likely to occur. The team at Manchester already has a successful track record of joint working; evidence that there is productive synergy between the partners. Results will be presented at scientific meetings, and published in high impact, peer-reviewed publications to ensure the widest dissemination of the results.

This proposal also offers a unique and significant opportunity for high level in-vivo and bioinformatics training of the fellow. This is a significant benefit as a lack of in-vivo and bioinformatics research training has been highlighted as a weakness in UK bioscience. 

Benefits of this research to the UK economy are neither immediate nor guaranteed. However, diabetes and related disorders (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease) are, and will continue to be, a massive burden on the National Health Service. This will only increase with the ageing population, in which circadian and metabolic disturbance is common. Thus, future economic benefits may be substantial.

All findings will be of interest to the general public due to the prevalence of 24-hour lifestyles in our modern society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>269390</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N021479/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
