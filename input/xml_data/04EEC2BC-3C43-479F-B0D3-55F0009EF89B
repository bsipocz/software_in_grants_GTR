The Fellow will be co-located in STFC funded research groups in the Universities of Portsmouth and Sussex with direct line management undertaken by Portsmouth but will spend half their time working with STFC funded researchers in the other 7 SEPnet partner departments.
The IPS Fellow will use their significant experience of the commercial world as well as an in-depth understanding of STFC areas of emphasis to focus on moving ideas and technology from research into economic impact outside academia, namely: developing commercial opportunities for exploitation of technologies derived from STFC funded research; capitalising upon existing IP and developing new IP; identifying opportunities for collaboration between funding and non-funding partners and identifying opportunities to transfer colleagues' knowledge and capability to academic disciplines outside traditional STFC areas. It is not a research post so, other than providing up to 4 hours per week of teaching within the SEPnet Graduate School on Leadership, Employability and Entrepreneurship and developing bespoke on-line resources on these topics, the Fellow will focus entirely on developing SEPnet departments' capacity for technology and knowledge transfer.
The IPS Fellow will benefit from the experience of the current IPS Fellow located at SEPnet's recently joined partner, The Open University, and from the IPS Fellow located in SUPA (Scottish Universities' Physics Alliance) - Avril Manners, Director of SUPA, is a member of SEPnet Independent Advisory Committee. The Fellow will also benefit from engagement with SEPnet's Employer Liaison Director and her team of 9 Officers (located in each department) to enable links with relevant businesses. Furthermore the Fellow will be expected to integrate into STFC's Innovations Club and participate in TSB's on-line innovation fora and to identify useful meetings and workshops to enable networking and to keep abreast of developments in innovation and KT.
The Fellow will make significant and regular use of SEPnet's infrastructure for virtual meetings and engagement with STFC researchers across the consortium as well as visiting for face-to-face meetings as required, prioritising those with pending or active collaborations in the first instance.
The Fellow will submit biannual reports and present at half yearly meetings as required.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project has been used to facilitate a step change in the work on impact in the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
