However, damage to our DNA by ionising radiation from the environment is a constant daily occurrence and DNA damage accumulation is thought to be involved in the development of ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To combat this, our cells usually contain efficient DNA repair mechanisms that act to prevent the development of these human diseases. Conversely radiotherapy, in the form of ionising radiation, is also still the most effective treatment for killing cancer cells, although it's effectiveness is variable in different cancers and side effects can be common. Despite this knowledge, complete information on how our cells repair DNA damage induced by ionising radiation in our chromosomes is still unclear and is the focus of the proposed research. This proposal is therefore essential for our understanding of the basic biological mechanisms our cells use to prevent DNA damage accumulation caused by ionising radiation, and thus act to stop the formation of human diseases. Furthermore, this proposal aims to provide leads to the development of new strategies in combination with radiotherapy, for the effective treatment of cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The critical cellular target for ionising radiation (IR) is DNA and DNA damage accumulation is implicated in the development of ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, IR is also the most effective cancer treatment and it is believed that its therapeutic effect is partially attributable to complex DNA damage (CDD), where several DNA lesions are induced in close proximity. However, very little is known about how CDD is initially recognised and/or processed in human cells. Since genomic DNA is tightly packed with histones to form chromatin there is emerging evidence, particularly during double strand break repair, that histone modifications (eg. ubiquitylation) are required to unwind or remodel chromatin to increase accessibility of the DNA damage to repair enzymes. However, the role of these modifications in the signalling and/or repair of CDD induced by IR is unknown. Therefore, I propose to understand whether histone modifications (with an initial focus on histone ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation) play an important role in the cellular response to IR-induced CDD. Using IR of different ionisation densities (ie. gamma-irradiation and alpha-particle/proton irradiation), which increases the complexity of DNA damage, together with various biochemical and molecular biology techniques, I propose to identify whether site specific histone ubiquitylation (eg. H2A-K119, H2B-K120 and H2AX-K119) is modulated in human cells at CDD sites. Furthermore, I will identify the enzymes involved using a candidate approach of known histone ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation enzymes, a screening approach by overexpressing/siRNA knockdowns of deubiquitylation enzymes, and a biochemical approach incorporating mononucleosomes containing DNA damage sites and protein fractionation. The goal is to improve our understanding of radiobiology, and ultimately identify new cellular targets for drugs and inhibitors that may enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in cancer treatment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to discover the cellular enzymes and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the recognition/processing of complex DNA damage induced by ionising radiation. This novel and niche area of research is aimed at understanding fundamental radiobiology research that is world leading. Critically, since DNA damage accumulation has been linked with the development of ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, this research may reveal novel cellular mechanisms that prevent these processes and stimulate further research in this area to understand the association with ageing and human diseases. The long term goal is therefore to enhance the health and quality of life for the ageing population and provide leads to strategies for preventing the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Furthermore, since ionising radiation is also a key treatment used in cancer therapy, this proposal aims to identify novel cellular targets, and the subsequent development of drugs and small molecule inhibitors against these targets, that can improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in cancer treatment. Consequently, the proposed work may be translatable to the benefit of cancer patients by increasing cure rates and also reducing acute and long-term sides effects commonly associated with radiotherapy, leading to an overall increase in the quality of life for these patients. This will also represent commercial opportunities with the development of these novel drugs and small molecule inhibitors targeting the signalling/processing of complex DNA damage induced by ionising radiation, and therefore will be of huge interest to the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. I propose, in the future, to focus the results of this research on improving the efficacy of radiotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), which is a priority translational research area for the Liverpool Cancer Research Centre. Importantly SCCHN is primarily treated with radiotherapy, although because of the common occurrence of acute and long-term adverse effects, novel agents and strategies are increasingly being sought for the effective treatment of these tumours. Therefore my research aims to achieve this long term goal, although realistically, the timescale for these benefits to be realised may take several decades.

Nevertheless, this fundamental radiobiology research proposal shows considerable promise in improving our understanding of the biological effects of ionising radiation, the association with ageing and the development of human diseases, and designing better strategies for the treatment of cancer. The staff working on this project (in addition to the included collaborators at the Universities of Liverpool and Oxford) will therefore be performing cutting-edge radiobiology research that is world-leading, whilst also developing communication skills through participation and presentation at national and international conferences, and these skills are highly applicable for future employment both in the UK and throughout the World.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Integrative Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Integrative Biology, Liverpool</gtr:description><gtr:id>81419839-9046-4BE2-A00C-C0AA487AEEED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs or outcomes have yet resulted</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8e60cb7ee9.06057566-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partner, Prof Rob Beynon, and his team from the Centre for Proteome Research have performed mass spectrometry analysis on purified histone samples, and provided quantitative data analysis on the types of histone modifications induced in cells in response to either low-LET x-ray irradiation or high-LET alpha particle irradiation.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My postdoctoral research scientist (Dr Rachel Carter) employed on the MRC Award, and I, have collaborated with Prof Rob Beynon to identify the histone modifications induced in the cellular response to ionising radiation.

Therefore this facility is currently at the forefront of research into proton beam therapy radiobiology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>56CF362A-335C-47A2-B1E3-D8D3F88E4400</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The establishment of the new research laboratory at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre is crucial in furthering our understanding of the radiobiology of proton beam therapy in cancer cells, and since this is currently the only such facility in the UK, were are at the forefront of research in this area.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c11ef5d410a1.57804553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Research Laboratory Examining Proton Irradiation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D991A06-826D-4C6F-9058-E57A1C28F970</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ubiquitylation-dependent regulation of NEIL1 by Mule and TRIM26 is required for the cellular DNA damage response.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a751ee3b42b9ef35f57436143bf4913"><gtr:id>9a751ee3b42b9ef35f57436143bf4913</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edmonds MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c10e6a6fbf19.23417246</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77CF5DBB-3607-4128-B58D-0870F85D78F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Misregulation of DNA damage repair pathways in HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma contributes to cellular radiosensitivity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oncotarget</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4c0d80b7ebd55bc8f606623732fbfe1c"><gtr:id>4c0d80b7ebd55bc8f606623732fbfe1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nickson CM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1949-2553</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c10f4b7069b3.72760234</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A517FAD7-0E6E-4B54-BA8A-806E9987942A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulation of base excision repair proteins by ubiquitylation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental cell research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a751ee3b42b9ef35f57436143bf4913"><gtr:id>9a751ee3b42b9ef35f57436143bf4913</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edmonds MJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4827</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675db780d20e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A26ACC36-E87F-4EB2-8DF6-8E2C05F12C41</gtr:id><gtr:title>Base Excision Repair, a Pathway Regulated by Posttranslational Modifications.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular and cellular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/784ef345a2c4f34106fb028e842dd790"><gtr:id>784ef345a2c4f34106fb028e842dd790</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carter RJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0270-7306</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d3abbcf0ab2.32943190</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DC567D7-1701-462E-91E7-1634AD1A4E46</gtr:id><gtr:title>Complex DNA Damage Induced by High Linear Energy Transfer Alpha-Particles and Protons Triggers a Specific Cellular DNA Damage Response.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/784ef345a2c4f34106fb028e842dd790"><gtr:id>784ef345a2c4f34106fb028e842dd790</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carter RJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0360-3016</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d2e65656fe5.38398819</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M000354/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
