To develop a robust innovative interdisciplinary methodology for integrating drought science and scenario-modelling with stakeholder engagement/narrative research. Through a systems-based approach, this method will lead to the production of an online resource of multi-stakeholder drought science-narrative data to input into decision-making in drought risk management.
2. To develop hydrological modelling of drought impacts at nested spatial scales (mesocosms, catchments) so evaluate present/future water resource availability, focussing on past, present and future drought periods across N-S and W-E climatic gradients. This will provide gap quantification between present/future water supply/demand for 7 case study catchments.
3. To develop several new mesocosm experiments in urban and rural environments, interwoven creatively in their delivery to progress expert drought science, and promote citizen science/multi-stakeholder awareness of drought impacts.
4. To develop a sequential participatory methodology that interweaves expert drought science with lay knowledge as a means of responding to gap quantification between present/future water supply/demand for case study catchments. This involves developing multi-stakeholder 'science-engaged' narrative enquiry so that it provides feedback on impact thresholds and adaptation/mitigation options in varied domains that can be input as parameters to 'expert' hydrological modelling.
5. To provide a critical interdisciplinary analysis of multi-stakeholder drought narratives explored within a robust systems framework. This will involve using systems thinking in analysing relationships between different stakeholder perceptions of trigger thresholds/tipping points for drought awareness/action, and physical thresholds for water/temperature stress.
6. To provide a detailed critique of potential synergies between story/telling/narrative enquiry and science communication in promoting the exchange of expert/lay science about drought risk and mitigation, and to capitalise on these insights in the development of the project's interdisciplinary methodology and science communication protocols. An 'open science' protocol will be designed to maximise stakeholder engagement/ capacity building through and beyond the research project's lifespan.
7. To develop an accessible engaging web-based utility for bringing narrative data into drought risk decision making. This will include developing a cutting-edge social media web-platform to share project resources/ensure longer-term sustainability of the narrative resource.
8. To provide an evaluation of water-use conflicts, synergies and trade-offs, drawing on historic drought experiences and integrating both expert/lay knowledge to develop drought indices for use in water resource planning. The project resources will be mined to construct a database of species responses/management options to mitigate drought/post-drought recovery at different scales; and to produce management guidelines/advice on coping with drought/water scarcity at different scales based on narratives from different stakeholder domains.
9. To undertake thorough project scoping for wider sharing: (A) structured international literature reviews on use of narrative in risk settings nationally/internationally; (B) scoping reports providing literature /secondary data on different UK drought risk settings from physical, historical, water-use by stakeholders, socio-economic and cultural character, and narrative perspectives, as a precursor to final selection of case-study catchments; (C) 7 catchment reports from literature review/ stakeholder engagement to determine the characteristics/functioning of each case-study catchment. These will draw together data on water use, water resources planning (demand, licensed abstractions, minimum flow data etc.) for observed and future conditions for each catchment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have high impact in theoretical, policy and practical terms in local/national/international contexts. In policy terms, drought is now one of the major risks facing the UK. The project aims to mitigate drought impacts, and through a new innovative multi-stakeholder decision-making utility, to make different stakeholders more resilient to drought risk and drought events. 
The project's impact strategy is driven and strengthened by the engaged nature of the research process. Key target groups/beneficiaries within, and beyond, those immediately engaged within the project have been identified. These include: stakeholders working at local and regional levels in different domains (health and wellbeing, urban design/built environment, agriculture/horticulture, utilities, government, business, tourism and ecosystem services) to manage the impacts of drought and water scarcity in the 7 case-study catchments; educational organisations (formal/informal); wider inter-professional groups in the UK with interests/concerns in drought risk management/mitigation of impacts, including communities and the general public.
Developing organisational stakeholders and communities that are resilient to living with drought risk and water scarcity, and resilient to future drought is of the highest priority. A multi-stakeholder shared recognition of drought risk, and a developing attitude of coping/living with flood events, are vital components of drought risk planning/resilience. This research will make a significant contribution to drought policy discourses and practices in the way it brings different stakeholder drought narratives into thinking about and developing drought resilience. 
The interdisciplinary and narrative based research methods are designed to enhance and dovetail with the impact strategy giving opportunities for new and innovative approaches to achieving impact. This integrates: how mesocosms and social media tools can engage new/different audiences, and how the inclusion of lay voices and narrative data might incentivise the policy process. Policy makers have to balance all these competing interests - so, rather than handing policymakers the science, the project supplies 'the whole data package'. For further detail on beneficiaries, benefits and methods, see the Pathways to impact document. These include:
- Project partners and stakeholders working at local and regional levels in different domains (water supply, health and wellbeing, urban design/built environment, agriculture/forestry, government, business, tourism and ecosystem services) and the policy/governance communities (Environment Agency, SEPA, National Resources Wales and local/regional/national levels)
- General public and communities (e.g. Local Resilience Forums with responsibilities for community lead adaptation planning)
- Scientists and artists working as part of different professional organisations (e.g. environmental regulators/wildlife conservation) 
- Individuals and collectives of creative practitioners and cultural activists whose work focuses on related environmental and sustainability issues 
- Educational organisations (schools, further/higher education but also less formal learning).
The case-study based research design will identify 7 catchments with a wide range of physical/socio-economic-cultural characteristics that will form a platform for wider stakeholder engagement across the UK. The project will have an integrated dissemination/impact strategy that targets different stakeholders for awareness, information and action for behaviour change. Impact will be delivered by on-going dialogue/exchange; a culture of co-production of knowledge, and working with key organisational gatekeepers/ communities in catchments and beyond. Impact strategies will include website/social media; open access research outputs for end users; participatory activities (seminars, workshops, conference) and a science-storytelling e-workbook for schools</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local Advisory Group meeting held at Harper Adams University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B381E77-D787-43CB-8FA1-3152C043A34A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The DRY project (Drought Risk and You) is exploring how science and narrative can interact in drought-risk decision-making.. On the 24th May 2016, the DRY team has invited farmers and others with interests in drought impacts on crops (including the NFU and United Kingdom irrigation Association) to visit crop experiments being undertaken at Harper Adams University. During the day, we are keen that farmers have the opportunity to share their memories, experiences and knowledge about the impacts of drought and water scarcity on their farming so that their experiential knowledge can come into play with the evidence from the scientists. 
In scene setting, Dr Ragab Ragab (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford) will discuss our drought risk modelliing with its implications for agriculture. The farmers and the DRY team will then visit the crop experiments and discuss the wider impacts of drought and water scarcity on Wheat, Barley, Triticale, Durum Wheat, Quinoa, Perennial Rye Grass and Lucerne. Dr Ivan Grove (Harper Adams University) will share the results of his first year of mesocosm experiments, within controlled water regimes comparing including a 50% reduction in rainfall from the Central England 50 year average rainfall and rainfall based on the rainfall for the CO2 high emissions scenario for 2050. The experiments are planned to continue for three years - with crops being rotated as per field use the rainfall patterns continuing throughout that time. The crops will experience water deficit from year to year to mirror both winter/spring and summer/autumn predicted changes.
This field visit will be followed by group discussion about the implications of this research for the UK agriculture sector, business and the public . Key questions include: Is agricultural drought risk management about changing the water regime of existing crops or changing to new crops or indeed both? The use of new crops not only has implications for UK agriculture but also involves changes in diet of the UK population. The event will be filmed by JackPerksPhotography and shared online as a prompt for further discussion after the visit. The DRY project is working with a range of stakeholders on the impacts of drought and water scarcity in seven case-study catchments - the Cornwall Fowey, Bristol Frome, Welsh Ebbw, Wiltshire Pang, Bevills Leam in the Fenlands, Sheffield Don and the Fife Eden.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd73f0150b77.29006580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dryproject.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local Advisory Group, LAG regular meetings every 6 months at the 7 study catchments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9387AD15-6414-490E-9014-DA9E597A6C4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In the Dry project we hold 6 monthly regular meeting at each study catchment: Bevils Lean, Fowey, Don, Eden, Frome, Ebbw and Pang. These meeting include the stakeholders, general public, the local Environment Agency officer, the local water company officer, the local farmers, the local Environment enthusiasts, small businesses, local school representative and local ex professional hydrologists. We present the modelling results, identifying problems and gap in our information and understanding. These often lead to a debate and most of the times, we receive feedback and extra support from the LAG. In 2016, a member of the Pang catchment LAG organized a guided tour to the gauging stations and showed where the stream flow of the Pang can be affected by the River Thames during the high flow periods. This also was followed by receiving reports on the historical flows at several gauging stations from a new member of the LAG.
