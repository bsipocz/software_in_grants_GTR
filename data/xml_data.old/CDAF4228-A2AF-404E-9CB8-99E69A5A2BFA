&amp;amp; Surveillance Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I021063/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Disease and contaminants both pose major risks to wildlife and Man. This is well recognised and there are a variety of surveillance schemes in the UK that monitor wildlife for occurrence and severity of diseases and/or contaminants. These schemes complement rather than duplicate each other but share many operational procedures and so can face similar challenges. The information gathered from each surveillance scheme is communicated to a wide spectrum of end users. 

The various surveillance schemes are run by different government agencies and laboratories, research centres, institutes and Universities. The funders of the schemes are an equally diverse range of government departments, agencies and industry. A key difficulty caused by this myriad of researchers and funding organisations is that it hampers communication between schemes. The schemes only have opportunistic and ad hoc mechanisms to exchange knowledge or develop common best practices that would facilitate sharing of samples and data. Such cooperation can also be hampered by differences between funders in the priorities that they wish surveillance schemes to address. Furthermore, because each scheme reports its findings largely in isolation, it is difficult for end users to obtain an overview of common or widespread threats. 

The main aim of this project is to establish a Wildlife Disease &amp;amp; Contaminant Monitoring &amp;amp; Surveillance (WILDCOMS) network. This will provide a partnership between nine current UK contaminant and disease surveillance schemes. The network will foster and facilitate knowledge exchange, harmonisation towards best practice, collaboration and sharing of resources. It will also enhance and widen communication with and between end-users, and in particular will provide end-users with an holistic overview of environmental disease and contaminant risk. This should make identification of emerging hazards and risks easier and quicker to spot, and provide the more integrated scientific evidence base needed to formulate better and timely policy and regulation. 

The specific objectives, delivered in four work packages, will be: 

(i) to establish and develop the network through regular partners meetings 

(ii) to use the network to maximise communication of integrated surveillance information to a wide range of end-users through an annual Stakeholder Forum and through collation of findings from all schemes into web-based quarterly bulletins

(iii) development towards harmonised operational procedures (sample collection, measurement, data recording and sample archiving) that will facilitate sharing and collaboration between schemes and eliminate duplication of effort 

(iv) to develop a sustainable model for WILDCOMS and extend its scope to a European scale through linkage with key European partners and networks

WILDCOMS will thus facilitate sharing of skills, expertise, knowledge, samples and data, thereby maximising the use of available resources. This will result in better value for money overall and foster development of new initiatives. 


The benefits the network will deliver can be summarised as: 

(a) ntegrated surveillance leading to an improved scientific evidence base with which regulators and policy makers can assess threats to wild vertebrates and human health 

(b) better long term management, sharing and dissemination of samples, best practice and data 

(c) a recognised forum that will facilitate discussion and collaboration between surveillance schemes and different end-users and stakeholders 

(d) an enhanced UK research base by increasing knowledge through scientific publications and greater awareness of activities and specimen archives

(e) benefits for industrial end users including potential for averting costs by preventing problems

(f) benefits to quality of life to the through improved risk assessment</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Zoological Society of London (ZSL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Zoology (ZSL)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Sharing of samples between collection schemes</gtr:description><gtr:id>81CA0B22-8029-4323-9897-6C26F444AD36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased availability of samples for multiple contaminants and disease screening and surveillance schemes</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56de0e9225ed70.90836741-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collection and sharing of tissue samples for archiving and analysis for the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collection and sharing of tissue samples for archiving and analysis for disease screening</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural Environment Research Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Sharing of samples and data with WIIS</gtr:description><gtr:id>5955493E-9E4D-404A-A1E7-A0BE57A446DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Additional data available for reports fromth edifferent schemes and additional archiving of bird tissues in the PBMS national tissue archive</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06562c56d78.60020364-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>each scheme has shared samples, post-mortem and chemical analysis data with each other so that information can be used by the different schemes run by the partners</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing of samples between partner schemes in WIlDCOMS, and specifically between CEH (for the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme) and both FERA and SASA for the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme.

As part of the planned activities of the WILDCOMS network, one of the work packages (Best practice guidelines and increased operational harmonisation) focused on increasing harmonisation, collaboration and efficiency of resource utilisation. This is related primarily to operations that are common to all partners' schemes, namely 'sample collection and processing'; 'necropsies and recording'; and 'specimen archiving'. 

In the first instance, the main objective was to compile an inventory of 'Sample Collection and Processing' amongst the WILDCOMS partners. This has now been done and can be accessed through the WILDCOMS website. It comprises four main areas: i) a general overview of the partner's schemes (including information about what is collected and why), ii) a description of the contaminant classes that are analysed by each scheme, iii) a list of the analysed contaminants and iv) an inventory of the disease screening techniques employed by the different schemes. In summary, WILDCOMS began with nine partner schemes which had expanded to 11 schemes by 2015. Each scheme has a dedicated website. Schemes have been running for different lengths of time with the most recent set up 2 years ago and the oldest running for approximately 50 years. Some schemes are very specific to a certain type of vertebrate taxa, such as birds of prey or fish, whereas others cover a wide range of taxa. The number of taxa analysed in each scheme is a function of the scheme's main aims. These aims include general exposure monitoring for contaminants and pesticides, post-registration monitoring of mortalities associated with pesticides, and disease surveillance and monitoring. The geographical spread of monitoring also varies between schemes; four analyse samples from throughout the UK, two are restricted to Scotland, two to England and three to England and Wales. Sampling in most, but not all, schemes is responsive, which means samples are found and collected opportunistically either by members of public or by scheme members; planned sampling is conducted by two schemes, both focussed on fish. The samples that are collected range from specific tissues to whole animal. All the schemes archive samples to some extent. 
 All schemes that undertake chemical analysis measure a wide range of compounds. These include legacy persistent organic pollutants such as organochlorine insecticides and PCBs, replacement flame retardants, trace and toxic metals, rodenticides and a variety of current-use pesticides. The number of compounds within each contaminant class that is analysed varies between schemes. For instance, 8 schemes measure insecticides and, in total across all these schemes, 115 compounds are determined. This means that, within the WILDCOMS network, there is the capacity and expertise to analyse a wide range of contaminants of concern for vertebrate wildlife and also the potential for the exchange of samples amongst the different schemes to quantify different contaminants according to need. 
 Six of the WILDCOMS partners screen for diseases and between them examine amphibians, reptiles, fish, mammals and birds. As in the case of contaminants, schemes screen for a wide variety of diseases and carry out studies that range from gross pathology to virology and -omics. General diagnostic tests, gross pathology and parasitology are carried out by all five schemes whereas other, more specific tests, are carried out by fewer schemes. 

The second inventory that was compiled related to the necropsies [and associated data recording] conducted by each surveillance scheme. This information has been compiled into an Excel workbook that can now be accessed and downloaded from the WILDCOMS website where it is held under the &amp;quot;Project Outputs&amp;quot; tab. The workbook contains the source of the material analysed by each scheme, the criteria for examination, species type, the aim and type of post-mortem examination, specialist procedures and links with other schemes, among others.

The third and final inventory that has been compiled relates to &amp;quot;specimen archiving&amp;quot;. This information has been gathered into an Excel workbook that can now be accessed and downloaded from the WILDCOMS website where it is held under the &amp;quot;Project Outputs&amp;quot; tab. The inventory contains data concerning the species, organs, etc, data each scheme archives as well as information on the number of historical archived samples, starting date of archives and the planned storage time. This inventory provides an important database of sample repository in the UK.





 As a result of the formation of the WILDCOMS partnership, there is greater sharing of samples to enhance overall the UK screening of contaminants and disease. Progress towards this is described in the policy impact statement for this grant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Details available on the web to all.

 In the first instance, the main objective was to compile an inventory of 'Sample Collection &amp;amp; Processing' amongst the WILDCOMS partners. This has now been done and can be accessed through the WILDCOMS website. It comprises four main areas: i) a general overview of the partner's schemes (including information about what is collected and why), ii) a description of the contaminant classes that are analysed by each scheme, iii) a list of the analysed contaminants and iv) an inventory of the disease screening techniques employed by the different schemes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E48F2A47-AC3F-4A57-AA8C-2DFF979FB4F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first time information on all sampling activites for all national surveillance schemes have been gathered together.
