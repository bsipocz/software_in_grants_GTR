As top 10 Global Cities, London, New York and Toronto are key places to explore educational trends. For example, London and other Global Cities are experiencing headteacher shortages due to headteacher retirements and teacher disinterest in leadership. As a result, leaders are taking up deputy and headteacher roles before they are 38 ? younger than ever. This marks the entrance of a new generation of school leaders most of whom are from GenerationX (GenX) born between 1960-80. While GenXers are often described as flexible, globally engaged, technologically savvy, accepting of diversity and collaborative, there is little previous research related to age and leadership.&lt;br />&lt;br />To explore this next generation of leaders, city-based Advisory Groups policy/practice experts and cohorts of 35-45 GenX leaders will be recruited for annual meetings. Annual leader interviews will examine career development; challenges and opportunities; relationships between age, experience, gender, ethnicity, nationality and leadership; and, school-level leadership practices. Outcomes will include City-based leadership profiles, policy briefs, within and across city interview analysis and school-level studies. Evidence will support policy and programme decision-makers and the leaders themselves. Findings, including reports, papers and resources, will be available at: www.globalcityleaders.org.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326164</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pontifical Catholic University of Chile</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Generation X school leaders: Examining the new generation of leaders in Santiago/Valparaiso, London and Toronto.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7FFD580-1C43-4301-9DA9-091588B85541</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration emerged from the keynote Karen Edge was asked to deliver in Chile on the Global City Leaders project.

The study has garnered much policy and practice attention for its preliminary findings on the past, present and future of GenerationX leaders. This session will explore how GenerationXers view: high-stakes accountability; perpetual challenge of finding work-life balance; persistent gender issues; the value of the social policy safety net on their careers.

The findings from the Global City Leaders study were very well received and the questions formulated to challenge school leaders and policy makers to improve their own practice and attention to recruitment and retention have been used to inform future rounds of funding and thinking by the Mayor's Office Education team. 


As a result of the talk several different activities have taken place. First, several organisations have reached out to the Global City Leaders team to collaborate and discuss the implications of the findings. Second, Clare Verga who is the head teacher at City of London Academy-Islington who was in attendance at the talk has agreed to co-host the upcoming Women in Leadership conference building on the Global City Leaders study findings.

Dr Edge's invited GCL keynote to the DfE National Fellowship Commission informed participant's recommendations to improve leader retention for the secretary of state. The Key and GCL team are producing a leader-leader interview series, 'Talking Heads,' to illuminate recruitment, retention, and work/life balance issues for 60,000 UK leaders. Dr Edge's GCL talk on recruitment and retention for the London Mayor's Education Conference informed a mayor-funded research study and a newly tendered programme to bolster London's leader supply. Dr Edge has been asked to advise. Leaders' reaction to the GCL findings are overwhelmingly positive and they often share how they have been personally and professionally influenced. Dr Edge has also won the UCL IOE Director's Prize for Public Engagement for the GCL project.

GCL generating international interest 

Dr Edge serves on international leadership expert panels including International School Principals (Ontario). GCL findings informed an Ontario government think tank on district-level succession-planning. Dr Edge will conduct an OPC-sponsored Ontario GCL speaking tour and is collaborating on an Australian leadership programme bid.

GCL creating Women in Leadership momentum and unifying stakeholders

The GCL team brokered BELMAS funding to host a multi-stakeholder GCL-inspired conference: 'Women in leadership: State of play and strategies for the future'. From this, Dr Edge and colleagues created Leading Women Alliance (LWA) with founding members ASCL, GCL Project (UCL IOE), Future Leaders, Mulberry School and @Womened. The first WLA Summit used the model developed for the GCL event and fuelled a new national school-based gender equality PLEDGE. GCL gender findings have had national coverage in the Times Education Supplement, The Guardian and national professional organisations (ACSL, NAHT, NGA). 

Informing UK women and diversity leadership development programmes

DfE-funded gender/diversity programmes regularly employ GCL findings, and Dr Edge advises two projects. She leads GCL-informed workshops on WiL, work/life balance, role modelling, talent-spotting, and retention. Dr Edge also designed bespoke governor and leader workshops to promote talent spotting and nurturing within and between schools.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F5E4A831-C398-4FA2-A1DD-FFEE7F163271</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545f95526c4e99.38135569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our ambitious three-year Global City Leaders (GCL) project successfully established a new knowledge base about Generation X (GenX), under 40-year-old, school leaders in three Global Cities (London, New York City [NYC] and Toronto). We recruited 49 influential policy, practice and academic leaders to our city-based advisory groups. Evidence was gathered via nine networking events, 120 leader interviews, and nine school studies involving 63 leader and teacher interviews. Our most influential findings coalesce around four themes. 

Leader working lives and future aspirations 
While all GenX leaders show unwavering work-related commitment, work/life balance remains an issue as few leaders role model and demonstrate healthy work/life balance. With 20-25 remaining working years, many leaders are already considering alternate career options. Five of 26 NYC leaders have already left. Findings are stimulating policy/practice strategies to support leaders' work/life balance and retention. 

Gender, race and diversity
Leaders experience city-based differences in how gender, race and diversity influences their leadership and lives. London-based women leaders perceive gender-based promotion barriers and disincentives to having children and taking maternity leave. In NYC, nearly all leaders experienced racially inspired leadership challenges. We posit that London's less diverse leadership cadre may result from the school-level leadership hiring practices with implications for system-level diversity. We are developing leader and organization-level tools to support reflection, benchmarking and improvement of gender and diversity-related issues. Our upcoming BELMAS-funded multi-stakeholder Women in Leadership conference will work toward solutions. 

Schools and talent-spotting
GenXers were nurtured into leadership by their former leaders and actively identify and nurture talent in their own school. As such, future leader recruitment appears to rest predominantly in the hands of serving leaders. As GenX leaders do not employ formal or consistent leader identification strategies, we are developing leader resources to enhance reflective and diversified talent-spotting practices.

Policy context and care for leaders
Social policy conditions (maternity leave, health care), accountability cultures and improvement approaches influence leaders' work and aspirations. As all leaders and teachers believe leaders must demonstrate care for teachers, we are examining how different education systems care for adults in their schools and the influence on leadership experience and retention. 

New questions
We are creating new GCL-inspired funding proposals with our advisors and other colleagues to explore: 1) leader work conditions, work/life balance, retention and social policy contexts; 2) innovative GenX recruitment, development and retention strategies; 3) developing online career trajectory data-gathering tools; 4) expanding GCL into new cities; 5) longitudinally tracking GenX leaders' careers; and 6) gathering more robust evidence with and for women leaders [NB: as a pilot, our GCL visiting associates have conducted 30 new interviews.]

New methods
Our new GCL career and identity tools have been well-received and are being written up for future submission to qualitative research journals. 

New networks and collaborations
The GCL project developed influential city-based multi-stakeholder networks that continue to influence the GCL project and overall policy/practice landscapes. GCL-strengthened institutional collaboration between UCL IOE, Columbia University (NYC) and University of Toronto has increased. We are also actively working with Pontifical Universidad de Chile- ValParaiso and have begun greater collaboration with Shanghai Normal University.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic
We have published four peer-reviewed articles and three book chapters. Two books are under contract for delivery in 2017 with Bloomsbury and Routledge. An additional four articles are set for completion in December 2017 focusing on new analysis of GCL evidence. New GCL-catalyzed research collaborations in Canada (UK/Ontario principal work) and Chile (London/Toronto/Santiago GenX work/life) resulted in on successful funding application. Our UCL IOE team recruited two PhD candidates to extend research in Shanghai and Melbourne. GCL-based academic teaching resources are being co-developed for graduate programs.

Policy and Practice 
Leveraging advisory group networks, we proactively share findings with governments, leadership-development organizations, local authorities, and trade unions. Our bespoke knowledge-sharing strategies include individual/team meetings, blogs, resources, and training sessions. Four international advisory group members now serve as UCL IOE visiting researchers to co-develop GCL-based city and topic-specific resources. On June 15, we are hosting a London-focused BELMAS-funded Women in Leadership event to share GCL findings and galvanize policy/practice actors to address identified issues. We are also exploring a Q&amp;amp;A webinar series. 

School Leaders 
We continuously support GCL young leaders via informal conversations, professional papers, and brokering local and international professional connections. Most participants are keen to continue collaboration with our GCL team via future research and development opportunities, academic study, and publication and resource development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>89A088E8-9619-442B-8798-43D73C62CCCC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f92cfabce49.04463900</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-061-25-0532/read</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Teaching session for MA Leadership: The lives and careers of Generation X leaders in London, New York City and Toronto: Data gathering strategies and analysis</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D450D2C-5A6F-431C-81F7-1C3C97D1BF42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr. Karen Edge work with International Master Students at the IoE/UCL improving their research skill and educational knowledge using evidence from the Global City Leaders project.
